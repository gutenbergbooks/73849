  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The present <i>Handbook to the Mediterranean</i> describes the
chief routes along the Mediterranean coasts. In his endeavour to
unite within a single volume the chief points of interest in so vast
a region the Editor has naturally been confronted by peculiar
difficulties. These points are so numerous that little space could
be afforded for more subordinate matters, so that many details
have necessarily been omitted. Again as regards the selection of
routes, and of places to be described, opinions frequently differ.
The Editor ventures, however, to hope that on the whole he has
satisfied the requirements of most of his readers. As many of the
regions which are here grouped historically and geographically<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
have already been treated of in several of his other Handbooks,
the Editor would respectfully refer the traveller to these for fuller
details<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The new subjects comprise Madeira and the Canary Islands,
the coast of Morocco, and Algeria and Tunisia, the materials
for describing which have been collected, in the course of much
travel, by several of the Editor’s friends and fellow-workers. The
chief Author of the German edition, which appeared in 1909, was
<i>Dr. F. Propping</i>, of Godesberg on the Rhine, who personally visited
most of the places described. The present English edition has
been prepared by the Editor’s old friend, emeritus <i>Professor John
Kirkpatrick</i>, formerly of Edinburgh University, who fifty years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>ago (1861) translated the Handbook for the Rhine, and thus introduced
‘Baedeker’s guidebooks’ to the English public. In bringing
the information contained in the new Mediterranean volume up to
date the Editor has received valuable aid from British and United
States consuls and ministers, and from other authorities, who have
shown the utmost courtesy and willingness to assist. To all of
these the Editor expresses his grateful acknowledgments. Many
readers will be interested also in the geographical sketch by the
late <i>Professor Theobald Fischer</i> (d. 1910), one of the great authorities
on the Mediterranean coast-lands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Special care has been bestowed on the <span class='sc'>Maps</span> and <span class='sc'>Plans</span> with
which the Handbook is furnished. Several of these are based on
materials hitherto unpublished, and others have been locally revised
and improved for the special benefit of the Handbook. In the case
of Algeria and Tunisia the French spelling has been adopted in
the letter-press as well as in the maps<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Note, however, that in the letter-press the English <i>j</i> is used in
preference to the French <i>dj</i> (as in <i>jebel</i>, mountain), and that the German
or Italian <i>u</i> is preferred to the French <i>ou</i> or the English <i>oo</i> (as in <i>sûk</i>,
market). So too, as a general rule, all the other vowel-sounds in the
proper names follow the Italian pronunciation.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hotels.</span> As in all his Handbooks the Editor has taken the
utmost care to recommend none but comfortable and respectable
hotels. From this, as from all his other Handbooks, advertisements,
direct and indirect, are absolutely excluded. Persons calling themselves
agents for Baedeker’s Handbooks are impostors and should
be handed over to the police.</p>

<p class='c011'>As many matters treated of in the Handbook are liable to frequent
change and as, in the Orient particularly, trustworthy sources
of information are too often lacking, the Editor will warmly appreciate
any communications with which travellers may kindly
favour him.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>I. Season and Plan of Tour. Health.</h3>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Season of Tour.</span> The mildness of the climate (p. xxxv) makes
travelling pleasant in the Mediterranean lands at almost any season.
Even in the height of summer travellers who can stand a little
heat will find residence in many of the islands and seaside resorts
quite agreeable. Winter begins here much later and ends much
earlier than in Northern or Central Europe, but until the end of
March few regions are quite exempt from wintry days and falls
of snow. March is considered also the windiest month in the year
on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the Portuguese coast, Andalusia, and Northern Morocco
(Tangier) the best seasons are from the middle of March to the
middle of May and the months of October and November. Granada,
which lies high, is suitable for a prolonged stay from April till
the middle of June. Seville and Cordova are often uncomfortably
cold in December and January owing to lack of heating appliances.
At Lisbon and Tangier winter is the season of the fertilizing rains,
which often last till the middle of March. With regard to the best
season for Madeira and the Canary Islands, see pp. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>, 32.</p>

<p class='c011'>The weather is generally bright and genial in Algeria, Tunisia,
and Tripolitania in late autumn, till the end of November, and
also in March and April, though less settled. Winter is a dry
season only on the E. coast of Tunisia and in the Sahara, but is
sometimes cool and windy (see also pp. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>, 172, 321). It is still
hot in October in Sicily, in Barbary, and in Egypt, where the
sirocco (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>) is specially disagreeable in the early autumn,
while health is endangered by malaria (p. xvi).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Of all the Mediterranean regions Egypt alone offers a dry,
settled, and genial climate in winter. The traveller on the Eastern
Mediterranean who wishes to avoid extremes of cold and heat
should make his first stay at Cairo in January or February, start
for the Syrian coast at the end of February or early in March,
proceed to Palestine and Damascus after March has commenced,
and visit Asia Minor and Greece in April, and Constantinople and
the Black Sea in May. In autumn, from the end of September onwards,
the above order should be reversed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Plan of Tour.</span> The traveller is advised to draw up a careful
programme of his tour before starting. All the places described
in the Handbook may be reached by steamer, or partly overland,
at any time of the year, but during the winter season (from about
the end of October to the middle of May) much greater facilities
are offered by excursion-steamers (see pp. xviii, 1, 2), circular
tickets, and combined tickets. American travellers may sail direct
from New York or Boston to some of the Mediterranean ports (see
p. xviii). Travellers from Great Britain may start from London,
Liverpool, Southampton, or Dover, or if they dread a long sea-voyage
may proceed overland to Marseilles, to Genoa, to Naples, to
Brindisi, to Venice, or to Trieste (comp. p. xxiv), and begin their
Mediterranean tour from one of these points. Some may prefer the
overland route to Spain and Gibraltar, while others again may find
it more convenient to travel all the way to Constantinople (Orient
Express), to Constantza (Ostend-Vienna Express), or to Odessa
(viâ Vienna and Cracow) by railway, and thence explore the Mediterranean
from east to west. The railway routes will be found in
‘Bradshaw’s Continental Railway Guide’ or in the German ‘Reichskursbuch’.
For the ‘trains de luxe’ services tickets must be obtained
from the International Sleeping Car Co. (London, 20 Cockspur St.,
S.W.; Paris, 3 Place de l’Opéra; New York, 281 Fifth Ave.;
Berlin, 69 Unter den Linden). For the sea-routes, see p. xvii; for
particulars application should be made to the various companies
or their handbooks consulted. Excursion, circular, and combined
tickets are issued by Messrs. Thos. Cook &#38; Son, Ludgate Circus,
and by other tourist-agents. It may be noted here that the ‘pleasure-cruises’
organized by many of the companies offer great attractions
at moderate cost, but at the almost entire sacrifice of personal
independence, while the fellow-passengers with whom one is associated
for weeks may not always be congenial.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a general rule it is pleasanter and less expensive to travel
with one or more companions than alone. Apart from hotel charges
and railway and steamboat fares, the cost for two or three persons
is often no greater than for one. Moreover, when off the beaten
track the traveller thus escapes from monotonous and monosyllabic
conversation with native guides or drivers (comp. pp. xxv, xxvi),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>and in case of illness or accident he is far more certain of obtaining
assistance and relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most useful language in most parts of the Mediterranean
is French. In Portugal, Madeira, and the Canary Islands English
is much spoken, in Egypt it is the leading language. Italian is
very useful in Tunisia, on the coast of Tripolitania and Barca, in
Malta, throughout the Levant, in Greece, and at Constantinople.
On the other hand a slight knowledge of Arabic will be found most
useful throughout the whole of N. Africa, from Morocco to Egypt,
and in Palestine and Syria.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some <span class='sc'>Hints on Health</span> may be of advantage to the inexperienced
traveller from the north. As a rule an overcoat or extra
wraps should be put on at sundown, though they may often be
dispensed with an hour or two later. When heated with walking
the traveller should not rest in the shade. In hot climates like
those of Egypt and the Sahara he should never remove his pith-helmet
or other headgear in the sun. Grey spectacles or grey
veils shield the eyes alike from the glare of the sun and from dust.
Sunshades also are very desirable in hot weather. As a rule it is
advisable to stay within doors during the heat of the day. On the
other hand many places on the Mediterranean are cold in winter,
Lower Egypt and Cairo being no exceptions. Steamboat passengers,
too, will generally find warm clothing very desirable between
October and the middle of May. An extra coat or shawl should
be donned in museums, churches, mosques, and other buildings
with stone pavement, as the air is often very chilly.</p>

<p class='c011'>When engaging rooms visitors should insist on a southern aspect,
which is almost essential for the delicate and highly desirable for
the robust. In every case, especially if the rooms do not face due
south, they should have a fireplace or else central heating. In the
Mediterranean regions, where many of the plainer hotels have stone
or brick floors, carpets are essential to comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>With regard to diet also a few general hints may be serviceable.
Oysters, fish, salads, and tinned meats should be absolutely avoided.
Raw fruit, except perhaps oranges and grapes, should be partaken
of very sparingly. Ices and iced drinks also are apt to be upsetting.
The contents of siphons, lemonade, and other ‘refreshing
beverages’ are not unfrequently composed of polluted water. The
safest liquids are boiled water, natural mineral waters, tea, coffee,
good red wine, and, in moderation, sound English or German beer.
Fairly good cognac or even whiskey may be obtained almost everywhere,
but for the time-honoured ‘soda’ or ‘potash’ it is safer to
substitute boiled or mineral water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Colds, errors in diet, malaria, and over-exertion are the chief
sources of the sharp attacks of illness to which even the hardiest
travellers from the north are liable in the ‘sunny south’. Sunstroke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>is another danger. Against all these the traveller requires to be
more on his guard than at home, where his nerves and his digestion
are much less liable to be overtaxed. Care and moderation in
sight-seeing and touring are therefore hardly less important than
attention to diet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the journey is begun a supply of a few simple remedies
(see below) may be prepared with the advice of the traveller’s
physician. In cases of serious illness one of the properly qualified
doctors mentioned in the text should be consulted.</p>

<p class='c016'>Diarrhoea, which may develop into dysentery, one of the commonest
complaints, generally results from catching cold or from eating unwholesome
food. The patient should first take a slight aperient and afterwards
several doses of bismuth. The diet should be arrowroot (which should
always accompany the traveller), rice or some other farinaceous food, and
milk; fruit, meat, fatty substances, and alcohol should be avoided. In
obstinate cases a change of climate is sometimes the only remedy.</p>

<p class='c022'>Sprains are best treated with cold compresses; the injured part should
be tightly bandaged and given perfect rest. In the case of a snake bite
or scorpion sting the wound should be immediately treated with ammonia,
or better still, cauterized. Sunstroke is not common in winter, but may
easily occur as late as November or as early as April. The usual remedies
are rest and shade; cold appliances are used for the head and neck; in
case of high temperature these should be iced. The best protection for
the head is either a pith-helmet, or a tall perforated straw-hat, with
several folds of gauze round it and hanging down over the back of the
neck. When the eyes are irritated with glare or dust frequent washing
with a weak boracic or zinc lotion affords relief (comp. also p. xv).</p>

<p class='c022'>Lastly a few simple and well-known remedies, most of which may be
obtained in a tabloid form, may be mentioned for other common ailments:
cascara sagrada, castor-oil, ‘Tamar Indien’, or Epsom salts for constipation;
a zinc or starch dusting-powder for chafed sores due to riding; tincture of
arnica, or Elliman’s embrocation, antiseptic wool, collodion, and sticking-plaster,
for bruises and wounds; ammonia (sal-ammoniac) or other antidote
(muscatol) to stings or bites; disinfectants, carbolic acid, insect-powder;
chlorodyne for neuralgia; quinine for cases of fever. Fever, be it noted,
especially in malarious regions (Sardinia, Sicily, Algeria, Tunisia, Greece)
is propagated by mosquitoes, especially by the female of the Anopheles
Claviger. Light curtains round the beds should therefore be used to ward
off the attacks of these troublesome insects. At dusk, and at night
when the room is lighted, the windows should always be carefully closed.
When a bite has been received the inflamed part should be at once rubbed
with ammonia.</p>

<p class='c022'>It should, however, be added, in order to reassure the timid or nervous
traveller, that few of these elaborate precautions are necessary except
for enterprising explorers who often leave the beaten track or whose
tour extends beyond the usual winter season.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>II. Money, Passport, Custom House.</h3>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Money.</span> A small sum of money to start with should be taken
in English or French gold, but large sums should always be carried
in the form of circular notes, care being observed to keep the notes
and the ‘letter of indication’ quite separate. These notes are issued
by the London and the Scottish banks and by Messrs. Thos. Cook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>&#38; Son (Ludgate Circus). The cheques issued by the American
Express Companies, by the American Bankers Association, and by
the International Mercantile Marine Co. are also convenient. Wherever
the traveller lands he will find an ample supply of the small
change of the country very needful.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Passports</span> are not absolutely necessary, except in Turkey and
in Russia; but consuls, and sometimes bankers, require more convincing
proof of identity than a visiting-card. Passports must be
shown at the post-offices also in order to obtain delivery of registered
letters.</p>

<p class='c016'>Passports may be procured in England direct from the Passport Department
of the <i>Foreign Office</i>, Whitehall (fee 2 <i>s.</i>), or through any
tourist-agent.—In the United States they are obtained from the <i>Bureau
of Citizenship</i>, State Department, Washington, D.C.—Travellers may
generally get their passports <i>visés</i> for Turkey or Russia through one of
the steamboat-companies or by applying to their consulate at one of the
chief seaports, if they have omitted to take this step before leaving home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Custom House Examination</span> at the various seaports and
frontiers is seldom very rigorous; but the traveller should be careful
to declare every new article not intended for personal use; and
he should note particularly that cigars, tobacco, and cigarettes,
weapons and ammunition (the import of the last four articles being
entirely prohibited in Turkey), playing-cards, matches, etc. are
liable to a heavy duty almost everywhere. These should therefore
be carried in very small quantities or dispensed with altogether.
It is rarely worth while carrying large supplies of any dutiable
article, as the formalities are tedious and the expenses heavy.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Turkey a second custom-house examination of luggage takes
place when the traveller leaves the country, a small duty being
levied on exports, while the export of antiques without the authority
of government is forbidden. In Spain, Italy, and Greece
also permission must be obtained to carry away works of art. Persons
who have made large purchases, or have a superfluity of
baggage to send home, had better employ a goods-agent.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>III. Steamboats.</h3>

<p class='c021'>All the leading steamboat-companies are mentioned in the Handbook
in connection with the different routes. The great Oriental,
Australian, and other liners, of 5–12,000 tons’ burden and upwards,
touch at very few Mediterranean ports (Gibraltar, Marseilles, Genoa,
Naples, Port Said). Travellers desirous of visiting the Portuguese
coast, Madeira and the Canary Islands, Algiers, Sardinia, Sicily,
Tunisia, Athens, Constantinople, and many other places of interest
must generally be content with smaller and often very inferior
vessels. The sections of the following brief summary of the chief
lines correspond with those into which the Handbook is divided.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span><span class='sc'>From the United States to the Mediterranean.</span>—<i>White Star Line.</i>

<p class='c011'><b>Overland Routes.</b> Travellers bound for the Central or
Eastern Mediterranean, and in particular those who wish to avoid
the long voyage to Gibraltar and thus to save five, six, or more
days, will choose an overland route to one or other of the Mediterranean
ports. <i>Marseilles</i> is reached from London by the ‘P. &#38; O.
Express’, starting on Thursdays, or by the ‘Calais-Mediterranean
Express’, daily in winter, in 20–20¼ hrs., or by ordinary express
in 22½ hrs.—<i>Genoa</i> is 27 hrs. from London, viâ Paris and Mont
Cenis.—<i>Venice</i> is 32¼ hrs. from London viâ Bâle and the St.
Gotthard.—<i>Trieste</i> is reached in 43½ hrs. from London viâ Milan.—<i>Naples</i>
is 46 hrs. from London viâ Paris and Rome.—<i>Brindisi</i>
is reached in 45¼ hrs. by the ‘P. &#38; O. Brindisi Express’, starting
on Friday mornings, or by ordinary express, viâ Boulogne and
Paris, in 54½ hrs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lastly, the traveller who proposes to explore the Mediterranean
from east to west, and who desires to economize time, should
consult Bradshaw’s Continental Railway Time Tables, or the German
Reichskursbuch, or Hendschel’s Telegraph, as to the great
Oriental expresses to Constantinople and the Black Sea.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Hints to Steamboat Passengers.</b> During the height of the season
(in Egypt Jan. and Feb., in other parts of the Mediterranean March,
April and even May) passages often have to be booked a month or six
weeks in advance. Holders of return-tickets or combined tickets must
secure berths for the return-voyage also long beforehand.</p>

<p class='c022'><i>Heavy Baggage</i>, to be stowed away in the hold, should be sent on
board at least one or two days beforehand. Each passenger should
endeavour, for his own sake and that of others, to limit his requirements
for the voyage to one or two cabin-trunks of moderate size. Private cabins
should, as a rule, be kept locked, and small articles should not be left
lying about on deck unwatched.</p>

<p class='c022'><i>Landing</i> or <i>Embarkation</i> by small boat is often an unpleasant proceeding,
as the boatmen are apt to be extortionate in their demands,
especially when the sea is rough. The charge for each passenger with
his baggage should be ascertained beforehand and only paid at the end of
the trip, or the whole transaction may be entrusted to one of the hotel-agents.
Small articles carried in the hand should not be allowed out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <i>Food</i> is generally good. Coffee is served between 8 and 10,
lunch at 1 or earlier, dinner at 6 or 7. First-class passengers in the
British and German steamers dress for dinner.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <i>Fees</i> vary according to circumstances. They are of course higher
if the passenger has been ill and has required much attention. The chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>steward or stewardess usually expects at least 1 fr. per day, and the
other attendants receive fees proportioned to the services rendered.</p>

<p class='c022'><i>Medical Attendance</i> and medicines, in case of illness, are nominally
free, but a reasonable fee is usually paid. <i>Baths</i> in the larger steamboats
are free, fixed hours being allotted to passengers on application.
Passengers may bring their own <i>Deck Chairs</i> or hire them from the
chief steward.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>IV. Intercourse with Orientals.</h3>

<p class='c021'>The objects and pleasures of travel are so unintelligible to most
Orientals that they are apt to regard the European traveller as a
lunatic, or at all events as a Crœsus, and therefore to be exploited
on every possible occasion. Hence their constant demands for
‘bakshîsh’ (‘a gift’). To check this demoralizing cupidity the traveller
should never give bakshish except for services rendered,
unless occasionally to aged or crippled beggars.</p>

<p class='c011'>Small fees are, however, not unreasonably expected by drivers,
guides, donkey-boys, and others, over and above their stipulated
hire. Excursionists should therefore always be well provided with
small change. If no previous bargain has been made the charges
and fees stated in the Handbook are usually ample.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the traveller should be both cautious and firm in his
dealings with the natives, he should avoid being too exacting or
suspicious. Many of those he meets with are like mere children
and often show much kindliness of disposition. In most cases their
attempts at extortion are comparatively trifling; but if serious, the
matter may be referred to the police or to the traveller’s consul.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand exaggerated professions of friendship should
be distrusted, loyalty towards strangers being still rarer in the
East than elsewhere. The natives are apt to make common cause
against European visitors. While their religion usually requires
them to address each other as ‘<i>yâ akhûya</i>’ (my brother), their brotherhood
does not extend to outsiders.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the Orientals are often remarkably dignified and punctilious
in their bearing, the traveller should show corresponding respect
and consideration for their customs and prejudices. He should
never, for example, photograph a Mohammedan without his leave,
nor look too curiously at the veiled women, nor don Oriental costume.
Sacred places, such as mosques, chapels, and religious
houses and their schools, must not be entered without removing
one’s shoes or putting on slippers, lest the carpets and mats on
which prayer is offered be polluted. Korans must never be touched;
and when prayers are being recited, strangers must keep carefully
aloof. In every part of the Orient the traveller meets with ‘saints’
(often imbecile or insane), who go about in fantastic rags and sometimes
stark naked. Needless to say he will give them a wide berth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>The traveller may least obtrusively observe the various phases
of Oriental life by visiting the native quarters of the towns, the
bazaars and markets, and the popular festivals and recreations of
the Moslems. Story-tellers at the native cafés (reminiscent of the
Arabian Nights), jugglers, wrestlers, snake-charmers, barbers’
shops, and native schools are all objects of interest. In Turkey
and in Egypt the popular theatres with their shadow-scenes (kara
göz) are curious. Ladies may sometimes, by special introduction,
obtain admission to a private dwelling-house and get a glimpse of
the manners and customs of Oriental women. On Fridays they may
see the Moslem women raising their veils in the cemeteries (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Gentlemen, when visiting an Oriental, knock at the door with an
iron ring. From within is asked the question ‘<i>mîn</i>’ (who is there)? On
being admitted, after the ladies who happen to be in the court have
retired, he removes his shoes lest the costly carpets be sullied, and uncovers
his head. The host approaches to meet him, one step or more
according to the honour he desires to do his visitor. The latter salutes
him in Oriental fashion by placing his right hand on his heart and then
moving it up to his forehead. Questions as to health are first asked,
but no allusion must be made to the ladies of the family, who are regarded
as under a veil (<i>sitr</i>). Coffee is always offered. The servant with
his left hand on his heart, hands round the little cups to the guests in
order of their rank. The guest holds the cup in his hand till it is taken
back by the servant. If the host wishes his guest to pay a long visit
he delays his order for coffee, and the guest must not leave before then.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is considered highly impolite to decline a visit, and each visit
must of course be returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Guides</span> who proffer their services everywhere may generally
be dispensed with, except by novices or by travellers pressed
for time. Most of those at Constantinople and in Asia Minor are
native Jews, who speak a little English, Italian, French, or German.
All, as a rule, are ignorant and uneducated, and their ‘explanations’
of antiquities or works of art are worthless. When, as sometimes
happens, they assume a patronizing or a familiar manner, they
should be promptly checked and kept in their proper place. If
a purchase has to be made, or a carriage or horse to be hired, the
aid of a guide should be declined, as the sum demanded is then
considerably raised, and part of it given to the guide as commission.
On short excursions the guide usually walks, and it is quite
unnecessary to provide him with a mount.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the large towns the guides and commissionaires are sometimes
in the pay of gambling-rooms or low places of entertainment.
Against such, especially at night, the traveller should be on his
guard.</p>

  <h3 class='c020'>The Mediterranean Sea and adjoining Lands.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Geographical Sketch by the late
<i>Prof. Theobald Fischer</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shores of the Mediterranean, formerly visited in part only
and imperfectly known, now most deservedly attract, throughout
their whole extent, an ever increasing number of travellers and
explorers. No part of the earth’s surface can offer so marvellous
an intellectual feast. Land where he may, the traveller is almost
invariably struck with the beauty of the scenery, the richness of
the vegetation, and the wealth of historical memories. For three
thousand years the Mediterranean was the theatre of all history,
the cradle of all culture, to which the whole of humanity more or
less directly owes its modern civilization. It was here for the first
time that the nearness of the opposite coasts and the numerous island
stepping-stones, coupled with winds blowing gently for months
at a time, deprived the sea of its terrors and gave birth to a hardy
race of mariners. The stagnation of the continental peoples was
thus powerfully stirred and their ignorance gradually dispelled.
It was first in Egypt, and then above all in Greece and in Italy,
that those mighty intellectual weapons were forged which were to
conquer the whole earth, while from Palestine came the mightiest
of all religious and moral influences. The Mediterranean was the
school of almost all the mediæval geographers and navigators, such
as Toscanelli, Columbus, Vespucci, the Gabotti (the ‘Cabots’ employed
by Henry VII.), and others, who added a New World to the
old, and who brought Europe into touch with the great Asiatic
cradles of culture. The Italians were the first to educate the Spanish,
Portuguese, French, and even English mariners, and to introduce
them to that Ocean which was to become the world’s commercial
and intellectual highway.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ancient Romans were fully aware, from a very early period,
that they could maintain their empire on land only by securing
their supremacy at sea also. Favoured by the central situation of
Italy, they gradually subjected the whole of the Mediterranean lands
to their sway, thus imparting to them a certain social and political
unity. The name of ‘sea in the middle of the land’, though of late-Roman
origin, still suggests the idea that both sea and land belonged
to Rome. But this unity was afterwards destroyed by the repeated
incursions of Germanic tribes from the north, followed by Arabs
and Turks from the south and east. Owing to the discovery of the
great ocean highways the Mediterranean was almost entirely neglected
in the 16–19th centuries, but since the opening of the Suez
Canal in 1869 it has become one of the world’s most important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>arteries of traffic. The establishment of the French in Algeria
(1830) and Tunisia (1881) and that of the British in Egypt (1884)
have still more effectually reunited Europe and Africa and promoted
the progress of civilization and commerce. With Asia also Europe
has been brought into closer touch since the Crimean war of 1854–6,
when the Black Sea was opened up, and new avenues to the Orient
were thus rendered available. While nominally belonging to three
different quarters of the globe, the Mediterranean with its shores,
being bounded on the north by a long wall of high mountains and
on the south by a vast and even more impenetrable expanse of desert,
possesses quite a unique individuality of its own.</p>

<p class='c011'>Geologically considered the Mediterranean forms part of an
immense depression girdling the whole of the earth’s crust and
separating the northern from the southern parts. This depression
probably existed during the earlier geological periods, but in its
depths has not yet assumed a settled character, as is evidenced by
frequent earthquakes, mostly tectonic, and by continuous volcanic
activity. This great depression is believed by geologists to have
extended in the mesozoic period into Central Asia, far beyond the
limits of the present Mediterranean, forming an immense sea to
which the name of <i>Tethys</i> has been given. In its depths were deposited
those strata, chiefly calcareous and argillaceous, which
were afterwards raised and converted into dry land by means of
the centripetal motion of the earlier masses of rock and by lateral
pressure. In proof of this it may be noted that some two-thirds
of Italy and four-fifths of Sicily consist of subaqueous formations
of the tertiary or even a later period.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the midst of this vast ‘Eurasian’ (European-Asiatic) region
of folded rock formation, some 930 miles in length, bounded on the
north by the solid primæval rocks of the continent of Europe, and
on the south by the great plateau of the desert, lies the <b>Chief Basin
of the Mediterranean</b>, embracing the Adriatic and the Greek
Archipelago, where the highly indented coast and the numerous
islands and peninsulas display a most striking variety of picturesque
scenery. On the other hand the smaller part of the sea, lying to
the south of a line drawn from the Lesser Syrtis, past the south
coasts of Crete and Cyprus, to North Syria, has been formed by
encroachment on the plateau of the desert (p. xxxiii), and is almost
entirely destitute of attraction. In the geological history of
the Mediterranean it is important to note also that three great rock-masses
of the earliest periods still survive. These are the Iberian
mass to the west, once probably connected with the kindred rocks of
the Atlas in Morocco; then the Tyrrhenian mass, in the centre, and
the Rumelian to the east. These three belong to the archæan and
palæozoic periods. Once towering to Alpine peaks, they were gradually
undermined by the action of the waves and by the subsidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>of the land. Their bases were thus partly covered with their débris,
built up in new formations. By later movements of the earth’s crust,
however, these shapeless primæval masses were again broken up,
and by the pressure and counter-pressure of the fragments were
piled up anew into smaller mountain-ranges of considerable height.
Thus from the Iberian primæval rock sprang up, in the Castilian
range (Sierra de Gredos), peaks to a height of nearly 9000 feet; in
the Rhodope of Rumelia rise similar peaks to nearly 10,000 feet
high; and even amid the ruins of the Tyrrhenis (p. xxxi) still
towers the granitic Monte Cinto in Corsica to a height of 8900 feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Around these great primæval masses, deeply rooted in the
earth’s crust, were gradually built up the recent folded mountains,
out of materials forced aside and upwards by the débris of earlier
rock as it sank into the sea. Thus on the <span class='sc'>Iberian Pedestal</span>, from
the north side, out of the depths of the great Biscay abyss, arose
the <i>Pyrenaean-Cantabrian Folded Chain</i> (culminating in the
Aneto or Maladetta, 11,168 ft.), the fan-like structure of which
has been due to lateral pressure coming from the Ebro depression
also. By similar pressure from the south side the <i>Andalusian
Folded Mountains</i> were piled up against the Iberian nucleus
(Meseta Mts.), and, though only 23 miles distant from the Mediterranean,
they tower in the Mulhacén of the Sierra Nevada to a height
of 11,424 feet, the greatest altitude in Europe apart from the Alps.
As the Pyrenees are fringed on the east, on the frontier of Spain
and France (near Port Vendres), with a deeply indented coast, so
too the Andalusian range is strongly marked by transverse fissures,
the eastmost of which have severed the Balearic Islands from the
mainland. Still more striking is the great westmost fissure or cleavage,
where the girdle of mountains takes a sharp turn from west
to east, where the action of tides and waves has hollowed out the
<i>Straits of Gibraltar</i>, and has further widened them within the
historic period. The Mediterranean is here separated from the Atlantic
by a submarine bar or threshold, at a depth averaging only
650 feet, extending from Cape Trafalgar to Cape Spartel, a distance
of 27½ miles, and forming the boundary between the inner
Alboran basin or depression and the outer or Andalusian. Thus,
on north and south alike the Iberian central bed-rock is bordered
with lofty mountains, whose seaboard almost everywhere repels
human traffic, and seems barred against Europe by the Pyrenees
and against Africa by the mountains of Andalusia. On the east
side, however, between the Pyrenees and Cabo de la Nao (p. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>),
the original rock-nucleus slopes gradually down to the Mediterranean.
Still more important is the western slope down to the
Atlantic, whose waves have penetrated into the lower estuaries
of primæval rock on the coast, thus forming a number of excellent
harbours, such as in particular that of <i>Lisbon</i> at the mouth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>Tagus. Towards the Atlantic descend also the plains of Lower
Andalusia, the so-called <i>Guadalquivir Basin</i>, which lies between
the Iberian central pedestal and the Andalusian sedimentary and
contorted formations. In this basin lie Spain’s chief seaports for
traffic with Africa and America, the island-harbour of <i>Cadiz</i>, the
estuary-harbour of <i>Huelva</i>, the starting-point of Columbus, and
the river-harbour of <i>Seville</i>, accessible to large vessels at high-tide.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <span class='sc'>North-Western Africa</span> the Andalusian contorted formation
is continued by the <i>Rîf Mts.</i> of Morocco (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>) and by the <i>Tell
Atlas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), extending to the south and then turning eastwards.
These ranges are characterized by deep fissures, formed by prehistoric
volcanic action and descending abruptly to the Mediterranean.
The whole northern coast of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia,
apart from numerous wave-worn beaches, is completely rock-bound,
forbidding all approach. Even the artificial harbours like that of
<i>Algiers</i> are maintained with difficulty. At the east end of this long
stretch of coast comes at last the welcome haven offered by the
<i>Gulf of Tunis</i> which runs inland at the mouth of the depression
between the Tell Atlas and the Sahara Atlas (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>), and on which
the Medjerda and other streams and several important roads converge.
Here, as in Lower Andalusia, a great avenue to the interior
was thus opened up. This favoured spot therefore became a great
focus of traffic, and as it lay on the Straits of Pantelleria (p. <a href='#Page_396'>396</a>) it
was also of great political importance. The ancient <i>Utica</i> (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>)
was succeeded by the ‘new city’ of <i>Carthage</i> (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), the predecessors
of the modern Tunis. From this base the Carthaginians, the
Vandals, and the Moors ruled Sicily and Sardinia. With such a
base as the admirable naval harbour of <i>Bizerta</i>, lately constructed
by the French, they in turn may perhaps some day become masters
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Straits of Pantellería</i>, leading from the western to the
eastern basin of the Mediterranean and separating the Atlas from
the Apennines, have been formed, like those of Gibraltar and the
narrow side-portal of Messina, by transverse cleavage. Owing to
the subsidence of the flat offshoots of the Apennines and to the
erosive action of the waves the straits have been gradually widened
to about 90 miles. The <i>Maltese Islands</i> are fragments, now broken
up by fissures, of what was once a tableland, but they too are
being rapidly washed away by the action of the surf. On the other
hand the island of <i>Pantellería</i>, which has given its name to the
straits, rising to a height of 2743 ft. from the verge of the central
abyss and 3900 ft. in depth, is of volcanic origin. These transverse
fissures are indeed generally the scenes of volcanic action, and
they are usually situated at points where the mountains of recent
contorted formation take a sudden bend (as is notably the case in
the lower valley of the Danube).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span><span class='sc'>Italy</span> forms an immense bridge across the trough of the Mediterranean,
extending to Cape Bon in Tunisia. Like a lofty embankment,
rising over 18,000 ft. from the bottom of the sea, <i>Calabria</i>,
culminating in the Aspromonte (6424 ft. above sea-level), separates
the <i>Tyrrhenian Sea</i> (12,000 ft. deep, though of recent formation)
from the <i>Ionian Sea</i>. The latter is the deepest basin in the Mediterranean,
attaining a depth of 14,500 feet. The <i>Apennines</i>, deviating
in their southern course from the usual ‘Eurasian’ direction,
were probably influenced by the primæval <i>Tyrrhenis</i>. This ancient
nucleus of the Italian continent has been broken up by movements
of the earth’s crust which began in the mesozoic period, were still
more marked in the later tertiary period, and continue to this
day. Some of the solid blocks, as in Tuscany, Calabria, and Sicily
(the Monti Peloritani near Messina), have been incorporated in the
later rock structure of the Apennines; others again rise as isolated
masses from the abysses of the Tyrrhenian Sea, such as Corsica,
Sardinia, and Elba. The lines of cleavage, especially between
Cosenza and Palermo, were marked by great volcanic activity. In
a curve, parallel with the abrupt ramparts of Calabria and Sicily,
rise the volcanoes of the Lipari Islands (Stromboli) and Ustica in
succession. To the north the series is continued by Vesuvius, the
Epomeo, and the Ponza Islands near Naples, and by the Alban
Mts. near Rome. All these lie on the inner declivity of the Apennines.
To the south the series is continued by Mt. Ætna in Sicily,
lying outside of the Apennines. In the quaternary period the new
Apennine formations underwent an upheaval which imparted to the
range its present orographical unity. The result was that the
straits which once intersected Southern Italy, connecting the Tyrrhenian
with the Ionian basin, were filled up, with the exception
of those of Messina, while these last were narrowed to 2 miles and
shoaled at the north end, where they are only 335 ft. deep. The
intensity of the upheaval is evidenced by the fact that quaternary
deposits cover the terraces of the Aspromonte in Calabria to a
height of 3900 feet above the sea-level. That these movements of
the earth’s crust still continue is proved by the variations of level
in the Bay of Naples observed within historic times. The most
striking instance of this is the great subsidence in the island of
Capri which has taken place within the Christian era. In the Blue
Grotto there we find remains of a flight of steps of the time of
Tiberius, descending to the water, but the lowest step is now 19
feet below the surface.</p>

<p class='c011'>Italy opens towards the west. On the west side lie its picturesque
bays and islands, as well as most of its great centres of culture,
<i>Rome</i> and <i>Florence</i>, <i>Genoa</i> and <i>Naples</i>, besides many others.
But the east side also is important owing to its close connection
with the south-eastern basin of the Mediterranean. The chief outlets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>in this direction are the lagoon-harbour of <i>Venice</i>, as great a portal
of continental commerce in the middle ages as Genoa is at the present
day, and the excellent harbours of <i>Brindisi</i>, <i>Taranto</i>, <i>Messina</i>,
and <i>Syracuse</i>. Were geographical advantages alone decisive,
Italy might again become mistress of the Mediterranean. Ethnographically
also she is highly favoured. Her population, densest
on the coasts, is about one-third of the scattered and heterogeneous
hundred million inhabitants of the whole of the Mediterranean lands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost all along the coast of the north-western basin of the
Mediterranean the recent stratified and contorted headlands abut
most picturesquely on the sea. On the north-west only, on each
side of the Pyrenees, the basin is bounded by a coast of the primæval
bed-rock formation, and is easily accessible from the Iberian mountains
by the valleys of the Ebro, Jucar, and other rivers. Still more
important are the avenues afforded by the <i>Aquitanian Plains</i> and
the <i>Rhone Valley</i>. Hence it was that from a very early period the
streams of Roman culture flowed through Marseilles and Narbonne
to western and central Europe. But these, like the Straits of Gibraltar
on the west, the Carso or Karst near Trieste on the north, and
the Bosporus on the east, afford inlets also for the cold winds which
sometimes pour into the warm mountain-girdled basin of the Mediterranean
and force back the zone of southern vegetation (p. xxxv).</p>

<p class='c011'>The southern margin of the north-western basin of the Mediterranean
lies in the same latitude (36°) as the northern margin of the
south-eastern basin (Cape Tænaron, on the south coast of Asia
Minor). This less favoured south-eastern basin sends two great
branches towards central Europe, the Adriatic and the Greek Archipelago,
both of which open out in the direction of the Suez Canal
and the Red Sea. From these branches run important roads leading
to the heart of Europe, in particular those from Venice and Trieste
into Austria, and that from Saloniki to Belgrade and up the Danube.
This last, as also the road from Belgrade to Sofia, Adrianople, and
Constantinople, traverses the <span class='sc'>Rumelian Primary Formation</span>, to
which the greater part of the south-eastern European peninsula
belongs (Thrace and Macedonia, extending into Servia). To the
same period probably once belonged also the north-western part of
Asia Minor and <i>Ægaeis</i>, of which last the only surviving relics
are the islands of the <i>Cyclades</i>. Here, too, over the primæval bed-rock,
recent folded mountains have been gradually built up. The
<i>Balkan</i> is one of these ranges. Another is the <i>Illyrian-Greek
Range</i>, running in a different direction, which with its broad girdle
gives the peninsula its southern trend, while shutting it off from
the Adriatic and barring direct access to the north-west. As the
Balearic Islands belong to the Andalusian stratified formation, and
as Sicily and its adjoining islands form part of the Apennines, so
the western stratified girdle of the south-eastern European peninsula
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>crumbled, even within the historic period, into peninsulas
and islands, formed chiefly by very recent subsidence. Thus arose
<i>Greece</i>, a hill-country with an extensive seaboard, a new and unique
region which was one day to reign supreme in the intellectual world.
It is probable that the Greek range of hills was once prolonged
eastwards, as appears to be indicated by the lie of the Cretan mountains,
and that these in their turn were connected with the similarly
stratified <i>Taurus Mountains</i> in Asia Minor. Just as the south-eastern
peninsula of Europe, with Asia Minor, thus formed the great
stepping-stones of traffic which brought the ancient culture of
Europe into contact with that of Mesopotamia and Syria, so when
the railway from Constantinople to Bagdad is completed a great
future may yet be in store for the Orient.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Eastern Mediterranean</b>, the smaller south-eastern
basin to the south of Malta, Crete, and Cyprus (p. xxviii), lies within
the region of the great primæval desert-plateau of northern Africa
(apart from the Atlas regions), of Arabia, and Syria, and has been
formed by the subsidence of part of that plateau. In contrast to the
richly varied shores of the western and central basins its coasts, as
may even be seen from a glance at the map, are monotonous. Their
formation, whether perpendicular or horizontal, is featureless, and
there is an almost entire lack of islands, harbours, and rivers. The
Nile greatly relieves this monotony, but its sources lie within tropical
regions far beyond the limits of the desert. <i>Alexandria</i> possesses
almost the only natural harbour on this flat coast of early
formation. The old-world characteristics of the land, its inhabitants,
and their language at once strike the traveller on landing at
<i>Tripoli</i>. Yet even this part of the Mediterranean, especially the
<i>Levant Basin</i>, beyond the passage between Crete and Barca, contains
recent formations. The hill-region of <i>Barca</i>, the ancient
Cyrenaica (p. <a href='#Page_413'>413</a>), averaging 1600 feet in height, is composed of
miocene marine strata. The bay now filled up by the Nile delta,
and at one time connected with the Red Sea, is of even later origin,
dating perhaps from the pluvial or glacial era. That the mouth of
the Nile once lay much farther to the north and watered Palestine
is evidenced by the identity of its fauna with that of the Jordan and
the Lake of Tiberias (crocodiles, for instance, occurring in the Nahr
ez-Zerkâ, to the south of Mt. Carmel; p. <a href='#Page_468'>468</a>). Movements of the
earth’s crust also account for the peculiar conformation of that part
of the great desert-plateau which we call <i>Syria</i>. It is only differentiated
from the monotonous North Arabian desert by the great
Syrian Valley or trough, running from north to south, and ending at
the Gulf of Akaba in the Erythræan depression (the Red Sea), which
dates from about the same epoch. On each side of this long narrow
furrow, descending to a depth of some 2500 feet below the sea-level,
strips of land have been forced upwards so as to form lofty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>mountains. These, in spite of subsidences and erosion, still attain
a height of about 10,000 feet in the twin-giants of <i>Lebanon</i> and
<i>Anti-Lebanon</i> in Central Syria. It is to this highly picturesque
mountain-wall, which condenses the vapours from the sea and remains
snow-clad till late in summer, that the Syrian seaboard,
10–16 miles in breadth, owes its luxuriant subtropical vegetation,
and Palestine its cultivability as far as its southern borders. Syria,
which may be regarded geographically and anthropologically as a
kind of peninsula of the Mediterranean, thus forms a bridge between
north and south, connecting Asia Minor and Mesopotamia
with Arabia and Egypt, and bounded by the sea on the west and
by the desert, only some 60 miles distant, on the east.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Black Sea</b>, which from the north-eastern angle of the
Archipelago runs far into the interior of the Old World, lies outside
of the Mediterranean regions. Like the inland Caspian Sea
it is a relic of the tertiary Sarmatic Sea, which was afterwards
broken up into lakes of brackish water. It was not till the diluvial
epoch that those subsidences which created the <i>Sea of Marmora</i>
brought the Black Sea also into connection with the Mediterranean.
Through the Sea of Marmora there must once have flowed a great
river, into whose valley the sea afterwards penetrated from the
south, forming the <i>Dardanelles</i> and the <i>Bosporus</i> of the present
day. Travellers on the Rhine will observe an interesting resemblance
between these straits and the Rhine Valley between Bingen
and Coblenz. Like these straits the Black Sea also is a great
trough hollowed out between lofty stratified mountains. On three
sides its bold rocky coasts are inhospitable and forbidding. On the
north it is bounded by the ‘steppe’, a plateau of primitive formation,
no less monotonous than the desert-plateau on the south
side of the Mediterranean, yet cultivable owing to its more northern
situation. At two places on this side, through gaps in the mountain
rampart, the sea has overflowed the plateau, forming the shallow
<i>Gulf of Odessa</i> and <i>Sea of Azov</i>. Two great routes of traffic were
thus opened up from the Black Sea into the heart of Eastern Europe
and even of Central Asia, enriching the world’s commerce with the
products of these regions, and at the same time forming the portal
through which Byzantine culture and Greek Christianity found
their way into Russia. Through these passages great masses of
cold northern air are poured into the Black Sea; but between them
the <i>Peninsula of the Crimea</i>, a relic of the broken-down mountain-girdle,
still stands boldly forth, giving shelter to an almost Mediterranean
vegetation on its southern coast. On that coast lies the admirable
harbour of <i>Sebastopol</i>. Nearer the Sea of Azov once lay
the flourishing Greek colonies of <i>Pantikapaeon</i> and <i>Phanagoria</i>,
and in the middle ages the Genoese settlements of <i>Sudak</i> (Kertch)
and <i>Kaffa</i> (Theodosia or Feodossiya). As the corn of Southern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>Russia is now the chief export from Odessa to London and Antwerp,
so, from the 14th century onwards, quantities of Russian
caviare were brought by Italian merchants from Kaffa to Bruges,
which was then one of the world’s greatest markets.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Climate</b> of the Mediterranean is very equable. In every
age northerners have been attracted by the mildness of the winters,
when the occasional storms and heavy rains are of short
duration and are soon succeeded by bright sunshine. The heat of
summer is tempered everywhere, especially on the more southern
coasts, by refreshing sea-breezes. The farther south one goes, the
longer the dry season lasts. At Tripoli, for example, it lasts for
seven months and at Alexandria for ten. The subtropical maximum
air-pressure over the eastern Atlantic, by which rainfall and wind-movements
are determined, is usually continued in winter past the
southern limit of the Mediterranean (comp. p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>), thus bringing
the whole of that sea within the zone of the changeable and rainy
winds of Central Europe. In summer the pressure lies farther to
the north, producing in most parts of the Mediterranean steady
northerly currents of air. The climate is tempered also by the
warmth of the sea itself. The bar at the west entrance of the Straits
of Gibraltar (p. xxix) keeps out the cold water of the deep Atlantic,
but allows the influx of the warmer surface-water to compensate
for what the Mediterranean loses by evaporation. This loss would
otherwise amount to a depth of 10–15 ft. per annum. The influx
of water from the Atlantic causes a current to flow along the North
African coast from west to east, but its thermal effects are soon
lost. In summer the surface of the Mediterranean is heated by the
sun up to 75–82° Fahr.; but the temperature diminishes rapidly
down to a depth of about 1000 feet, where it reaches a uniform
minimum corresponding with the surface temperature of February,
the coolest month in the year. This in the north-western basin is
55° Fahr. only, and in the south-eastern 56¼°, but it suffices to
temper the cold winds of winter, while additional warmth is brought
from time to time by the hot sirocco from the interior of Africa
(comp. p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>). It may be stated generally that the winter temperature
on the Mediterranean averages 14° Fahr. above that of almost
all other regions in the same latitude. The warmest places are of
course those on the coasts facing the south and sheltered from the
north, while the average temperature rises gradually from south-east
to north-west.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Vegetation</b> is rich and varied. Evergreens abound, being
better able to stand the long droughts than deciduous trees and
shrubs. Among the forest-trees in the warmer regions the commonest
are pines, including stone-pines, and oaks of the evergreen
and other varieties. The underwood (<i>macchia</i>, <i>maquis</i>, or <i>garrigue</i>,
Grk. <i>phrýgana</i>) is composed of mastic-bushes (Pistacia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>lentiscus), myrtles, arbutus-trees (Arbutus unĕdo), broom, tree-like
heaths (Erica arborea and scoparia), resinous and aromatic
cistus-shrubs with large blossoms resembling wild roses, and climbing-plants
of many varieties. Most prominent among trees in the
cultivated lands is the silver-grey olive, which, as well as the vine
and the fig-tree, has thriven here from the earliest times and is
the most characteristic feature in every Mediterranean landscape.
Most of the other fruit-trees also have been known here since
remote antiquity. The fruit of the date-palm attains perfection in
the oases of North Africa only (comp. p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>), but the tree bears
fruit on the Spanish coast, and is very popular as an ornamental
tree on the French and Italian Riviera and in other sheltered situations.
Lemons were introduced by the Arabs, and oranges were
brought from southern China by the Portuguese about the middle
of the 16th century. Many other foreign trees and plants have
been introduced since then. Aloes and opuntias, which now grow
wild and are often regarded as characteristic of the Mediterranean,
were introduced from America. In the beautiful and luxuriant
gardens, especially in Italy, on the French Riviera, and in
Algeria, the flora of almost every quarter of the globe is represented.</p>

<p class='c011'>No less varied and interesting are the <b>Inhabitants</b> of the
Mediterranean lands, who belong to three distinct continents, and
who differ widely in race and language, in religion and culture.
In remote mountain-regions there still exist peoples, like the
<i>Basques</i> and the <i>Albanians</i>, who belong to the oldest races in
Europe. In the south and the east dwell <i>Arabs</i> and <i>Turks</i>, comparatively
recent immigrants from the steppes of Asia. On one
side, as in Southern France, is witnessed the height of civilization;
on the other, as in Albania and many parts of Northern
Africa, the population is sunk in the depths of ignorance. The
dwellers in the west profess the Roman Catholic faith, those in
the east belong to the Greek Catholic church, while they differ
materially in culture also. Christianity again is antagonistic to
Islam, which prevails in Turkey, Asia Minor, Syria, and North
Africa. The inhabitants of the Atlas regions, of Tripolitania, and
of Barca are <i>Berbers</i> (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>), who are neither Arabs nor Turks,
but are more akin to the Europeans. The Osman Turks of the
Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor have been so blended with
Mediterranean races that they now retain little of their original
Mongolian character. Entirely distinct again from the Arabs are
the Aramaic <i>Syrians</i>, although they speak Arabic, and so too are
the <i>Fellahin</i> of Egypt. Most mixed perhaps of all is the blood of
the <i>Modern Greeks</i>.</p>

fortnightly and the <i>Papayanni Line</i> occasionally; fares in all these range
from 6<i>l.</i> to 8<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c022'>2. <span class='sc'>Coasting Steamers.</span> <i>Hall Line</i>, weekly from London to Lisbon,
Gibraltar, Málaga, and Cadiz; the <i>Pacific Line</i>, fortnightly from Liverpool
to La Rochelle-Pallice (for Bordeaux), Corunna, Vigo, Leixões (for
Oporto), Lisbon, and St. Vincent (Cape Verde), and thence to S. America
(passengers for the Mediterranean requiring of course to tranship at
Lisbon or St. Vincent); the <i>Nederland Royal Mail Steamers</i>, fortnightly
from Southampton for the Mediterranean and Batavia, touch at Lisbon,
and so also those of the <i>Rotterdam Lloyd</i>, fortnightly from Southampton,

the <i>Hamburg-American</i> and <i>Hamburg &#38; South American Cos.</i>, calling
several times monthly at Southampton, also touch occasionally at Lisbon;
<i>Royal Holland Lloyd</i>, monthly from Dover to Boulogne, Corunna, Vigo,
Lisbon, etc.; the vessels of the <i>Compañía Trasatlántica</i>, monthly from
Liverpool, call at Corunna, Vigo, Lisbon, Cadiz, Cartagena, Valencia,
Barcelona, and Genoa, on their voyages to Colombo and Manila.</p>

<p class='c022'>3. <span class='sc'>Excursion Steamers.</span> Many of the above companies and others
besides organize Mediterranean cruises and circular tours at very reasonable
fares, whereby everything is made easy and comfortable; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>more enterprising and independent traveller will greatly prefer to piece
his tour together for himself, combining the various routes to suit his
own convenience, and often lingering for days in profoundly impressive
historic places or amid glorious scenery, where the hurriedly conducted
tourist can spend a few hours only. Among the excursion steamers may
be mentioned the ‘Vectis’ of the <i>Peninsular &#38; Oriental Co.</i>, which offers
a trip of 10 days from London to Lisbon, Gibraltar, Tangier, Málaga,
and Marseilles for 10–15 guineas, and another, of 21 days, from Marseilles
to Palermo, Constantinople, the Piræus, Naples, and Marseilles, for
21–40 <i>gs.</i> Similar cruises are offered by the <i>Cunard Line</i>, starting from
Liverpool for the Mediterranean and Adriatic, the <i>Orient Royal Line</i> from
London (20 days; fares from 18 <i>gs.</i>), and by ‘<i>Continental Travel</i>’ (5 Endsleigh
Gardens, London), some of the last-named (either from Southampton
or from Marseilles) extending to Egypt and the Holy Land, and lasting
from 13 to 34 days (fares 10–26 <i>gs.</i>).—The voyage from London to Lisbon
(about 1170 M.) usually takes 3½ days, and thence to Gibraltar (about
350 M.) one day more; but some of the steamers take longer, while much
of course depends on the number of ports called at and on the length of
stay made at each. For details as to the sailings, which, as well as fares,
are liable to frequent alteration, application should be made to the various
companies, or to Messrs. Thos. Cook &#38; Son (Ludgate Circus, London,
E.C.) or other tourist-agencies.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>To Gibraltar Direct.</span> As indicated at p. <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>, most of the great
steamers bound for Port Said, India, Australia, and other distant
parts steer for Gibraltar direct.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the <span class='sc'>Coasting Steamers</span> to Gibraltar some touch at Lisbon
only, others at Leixões (or Oporto) and Lisbon, and others again
at various additional stations. All the important stations are here
mentioned in their order.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Hamburg-American steamers call at <i>Boulogne</i> (see Baedeker’s
N. France) to take up passengers for Lisbon and America.
Most of the vessels pass the <i>Cap de la Hague</i>, a little to the
N.W. of Cherbourg, and the <i>Channel Islands</i>, which belong to
Great Britain. The first of these is <i>Alderney</i> (Fr. <i>Aurigny</i>); next
comes the islet of <i>Burhou</i>; beyond it, behind the dangerous rocks
called the <i>Casquets</i>, marked by a triple flashing light, lies <i>Guernsey</i>
(‘green island’), and farther away, to the left, is <i>Jersey</i>. The
coast of Brittany or Bretagne is visible in clear weather only.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the steamers leave the English Channel near <i>Ushant</i> (<i>Ouessant</i>;
lighthouse), an island near the coast of Brittany, and steer
to the S.S.W. across the <i>Bay of Biscay</i> (<i>Viscaya</i>), where, even
in fine weather, the heavy swell of the open Atlantic is distinctly
felt. The steamers of the Pacific Line and of the Rotterdam Lloyd
touch at <b>La Pallice</b>, 3 M. from <i>La Rochelle</i>. From La Rochelle,
an interesting historic town, by railway to (145 M.) Bordeaux, see
Baedeker’s Southern France. The Bay of Biscay is bounded on the
S. by the N. coast of Spain, with which the W. coast of France
forms a right angle. In this angle, far to the E. of the steamer’s
course, lie Bayonne and the famous health resort of Biarritz. To
the S.W. of the latter is (8 M.) St. Jean de Luz, and 8 M. farther
is Hendaye, on the Spanish frontier (see Baedeker’s S. France).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>In Spain, 12 M. to the W. of the frontier, is situated San Sebastián,
a strikingly picturesque town and fashionable seaside
resort; 71½ M. farther to the W. lies Bilbao, famed for its iron
and steel, 74 M. beyond which is Santandér, with its important
harbour. About 280 M. farther to the W. are the N.W. headlands
of Spain which mark the S.W. end of the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamers of the Pacific Line, the Compañía Trasatlántica,
and some others next call at <b>Corunna</b>, Span. <i>La Coruña</i>, a picturesque
and important seaport famed in history, and the chief arsenal
of N. Spain (see Baedeker’s Spain and Portugal; debarkation or
embarkation 1 peseta). Time permitting, passengers may spend
an hour or two on shore in walking through the new town (<i>Pescadería</i>)
and the loftily situated old town (<i>Ciudad Vieja</i>), and in
ascending to the <i>Torre de Hércules</i> (185 ft.; lighthouse), about
1 M. to the N. of the town, for the sake of the splendid view it
affords. Some 35 M. to the W. of Corunna lie the small <i>Sisargas
Islands</i>, beyond which all the vessels steer to the S., past <i>Cabo
Villano</i> (lighthouse), <i>Cabo Toriñana</i> (lighthouse), and <i>Cape Finisterre</i>.
To the E., in clear weather, we may descry the long outlines
of the Galician mountain-range (‘sierra’). Beyond Cape Finisterre
we pass a number of far-penetrating inlets (<i>rias</i>) which abound
on the W. coast of Galicia. Many steamers touch also at <b>Vigo</b>,
a seaport and sea-bathing place most picturesquely situated on the
<i>Ria de Vigo</i>, the southmost inlet of Galicia, which runs 19 M.
inland (debarkation or embarkation 1 peseta). Fine view near the
lofty Castillo del Castro, to the S. of the town. Some eight or nine
hours’ steaming carries us from Vigo, past the mouth of the <i>Minho</i>,
the boundary between Spain and Portugal, to—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Leixões</b> (pron. layshŏengsh; Brit. vice-consul, T. Coverley),
the first Portuguese port, lying at the mouth of the little river <i>Leça</i>
and forming the outer harbour of <i>Oporto</i>. About 2½ M. farther to
the S. is the mouth of the <i>Douro</i>, usually entered by the smaller
steamers bound for (3½ M.) Oporto itself.</p>

<p class='c016'>Passengers who wish to go ashore at Leixões are conveyed by motor-boat
or rowing-boat (about 225 reis or 1<i>s.</i>, and half as much more for
luggage) to the custom-house. Visitors with heavy luggage require to
take the train (Leça station, near the Alfándega or custom-house) to
Oporto (Estacão da Boa Vista, in the N. of the town); others may take
the electric tramway (120 rs.), running from Leixões through the villa-suburb
of <i>Leça da Palmeira</i> and the watering-places of <i>Mattosinhos</i> and
<i>São João da Foz</i>, and up the right bank of the Douro, to Oporto (about
5 M., in 1 hr.). It goes as far as the Praça de Dom Pedro; but those in
haste will alight in the Rua do Infante Dom Henrique (comp. p. <a href='#Page_4'>4</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Oporto.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotels.</span> *<i>Hot. do Porto</i>, <i>Hôt. de Paris</i>, <i>Hôt. de Francfort</i>,
etc.—<i>Café-Restaurant International</i>, Praça de Dom Pedro 14; <i>Café
Suisse</i>, same square, No. 122; <i>Café Marques</i>, in the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Cab</span> 500 rs., or about 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, per hour.</p>

Crystal Palace.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><i>Oporto</i>, or briefly <i>Porto</i> (‘harbour’) in Portuguese, is a busy commercial
town of 172,400 inhab., the industrial capital of N. Portugal, and the place
from which the famous wines of the upper valley of the Douro are chiefly
exported. It lies 3½ M. from the sea, on the lofty right bank of the
Douro, which has forced its passage here through the granite rock. The
old town, with its quaint balconied houses, whose walls are often faced
with coloured tiles, rises in terraces on the rocky slopes. The new town
lies on a lofty plateau to the N., E., and W. of the old.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the N. of the Rua do Infante Dom Henrique is the <i>Exchange</i>
(Bolsa), with its showy hall in the Moorish style. To the E. of it stands
the <i>Monument of Prince Henry the Navigator</i> (p. <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>). Adjoining the
exchange is the Gothic church of <i>São Francisco</i> (entrance on the W.
side), containing elaborate gilt wood-carving of the 17–18th centuries. Near
the E. end of the Rua do Infante Dom Henrique is the so-called <i>English
Factory House</i> (Associação Britannica), an imposing building erected by
an Englishman in 1785 and now used as a kind of club. The nearest
tramway-car conveys us to the Praça de Dom Pedro, the business centre
of the city, with an <i>Equestrian Statue of Pedro IV.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>) commemorating
the granting of the constitution (1826). We ascend to the W. by the
steep Calçada dos Clérigos to the church of <i>Igreja dos Clérigos</i> (427 ft.),
the tower of which (246 ft.; ticket of admission 100 rs.) commands a panoramic
view of the city, the river, and the coast. Adjoining the church
on the W. is the Campo dos Martyres da Patria, with the beautiful
grounds of the <i>Jardim da Cordoaria</i>. We next proceed by the electric
tramway ‘Palacio’ to the <i>Crystal Palace</i> (adm. 20, 50 or 100 rs.) with its
beautiful pleasure-grounds and superb view of the city, the river, and
the sea. The same electric tramway, now entitled the ‘Praça de Dom
Pedro’, returns viâ the Rua da Cedofeita to the Praça de Dom Pedro;
we, however, change tramway-cars in the former and proceed by the tramway
‘Campanha’ viâ the Praça de Dom Pedro to the pretty <i>Jardim de São
Lázaro</i>. From the S.W. angle of the garden the Rua das Fontainhas
descends to the <i>Passeio das Fontainhas</i> with a view of the river, its S.
bank, and both bridges. Following this promenade to the W. we reach
the Largo da Policia with a fountain, where remains of the <i>City Walls</i>
are to be seen. Hence the Rua de Saraiva de Carvalho leads us, before it
descends in an abrupt curve to the left, into the vicinity of the <i>Sé</i>, or
Cathedral, now almost entirely modernized. We may now traverse the
upper roadway (toll 5 rs.; tramway-car if desired) of the magnificent
<i>Ponte de Dom Luiz Primeiro</i>, spanning the Douro with a single iron
arch of 564 ft. On the S. bank, on an eminence immediately to the left,
lies the ruinous Augustine convent of <i>Nossa Senhora da Serra do Pilar</i>
where Wellington effected his celebrated passage of the Douro against
the French (1809). The view, especially from the dome of the church,
is very fine. We make our way, at first by steps, then by a steep
descent, to the lower roadway of the bridge. Returning to the N. bank
of the Douro we follow the Rua Cima do Muro to the Praça da Ribeira
which affords an insight into popular life and commands a striking retrospect
of the Ponte de Dom Luiz. In the neighbourhood we may take
the electric tramway ‘Leça’ which conveys us back to Leixões. In the
reverse direction we regain the Praça de Dom Pedro.—Comp. <i>Baedeker’s
Spain and Portugal</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the greater <span class='sc'>Ocean Steamers</span> rarely sight the land, those
bound for Lisbon skirt the flat Portuguese coast for some 150 M.,
from Oporto to <i>Cabo Carvoeiro</i>, steering past the <i>Berlengas Islands</i>
(lighthouse), and then rounding the <i>Serra de Cintra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_15'>15</a>),
which ends in the <i>Cabo da Roca</i> (472 ft.), the westmost point of
Europe, with its great lighthouse. Passing the <i>Cabo Raso</i>, we
now steer due E. into the <i>Bay of Cascaes</i>, the ‘Riviera’ of Portugal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and enter the month of the <i>Tagus</i> (<i>Tejo</i>), where the lighthouses of
<i>Torre de São Julião</i> and <i>Torre de Bugio</i> rise conspicuously. On
the left we next observe the <i>Torre de Belem</i> and the extensive
streets of <b>Lisbon</b> (see R. 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving Lisbon, several of the great liners steer due W. across
the Atlantic to America. Other vessels head to the S.W. for Madeira
(p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>), and others again due S., past the <i>Cabo de Espichel</i>, on
their way to Gibraltar or Tangier. About 120 M. to the S. of Lisbon
we are off *<i>Cape St. Vincent</i> (Cabo de São Vicente), the ancient
<i>Promontorium Sacrum</i>. This huge rocky plateau, with its
reddish-brown precipices rising sheer above the sea, presents an
imposing appearance. Just beyond it are an old monastery and a
lighthouse and then the <i>Cabo Sagres</i>. Between these capes we
obtain a glimpse of the dreary and sunburnt interior of the country,
with its few poor villages. Beyond the Cabo Sagres lies the
little town of <i>Sagres</i>, founded by Henry the Navigator (1421) as
headquarters for his voyages of exploration. Both before and after
rounding these two capes we sometimes obtain a pleasant view of
the <i>Serra de Monchique</i> (2963 ft.), and before leaving the coast
of <i>Algarve</i> we may distinguish the little towns of <i>Lagos</i> and <i>Albufeira</i>
and the <i>Cabo de Santa Maria</i>. Steering now due E., the
smaller trading-vessels call at <i>Huelva</i>, a little beyond the Spanish
frontier, noted as the shipping-port for the great Tharsis and Rio
Tinto mines, and as the starting-point of Columbus (pp. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>, 64)
for his voyage to America in 1492, while other vessels call at <i>Cadiz</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>); all the larger steamers however proceed direct across the
Bay of Cadiz to the S.E. to the Straits of Gibraltar, and either call
at Gibraltar itself, or pass it on their eastward voyage without
stopping; a certain number touch at <i>Tangier</i> (p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Straits of Gibraltar</i>, anciently called <i>Fretum Gaditanum</i>
or <i>Herculeum</i> (comp. Map, p. <a href='#Page_49'>49</a>), from Gades (p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>) or from
the Pillars of Hercules (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>), date from the pliocene age, when the
action of tides and waves forced a passage from the Atlantic into
the great inland cavity of the Mediterranean. The straits are
widest at the W. entrance, between <i>Cape Trafalgar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>) on
the left, and <i>Cape Spartel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>) on the right. The narrowest
part (8 M.) is between the <i>Punta Canales</i> (p. <a href='#Page_6'>6</a>) and <i>Cape Ciris</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>). The E. entrance, between <i>Europa Point</i> (p. <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>) and the
<i>Punta Santa Catalina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>), is 12½ M. in breadth. Between
the ocean and the inland sea run strong currents, the upper and
lighter, from W. to E., sometimes setting at the rate of 5 M. an
hour, while the lower, being more strongly impregnated with salt
and therefore heavier, flows in the opposite direction. These currents,
coupled with the conflict of winds at the meeting of the
waters, often cause serious trouble to sailing-vessels.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the right, far to the S.E. as we steer into the straits, appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the lighthouse on Cape Spartel, to the E. of which opens the
bay of <i>Tangier</i> (p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>), bounded on the E. by <i>Cape Malabata</i>.
To the left, on the treeless coast of Andalusia enlivened only by
the numerous ancient watch-towers, lies the town of <i>Tarifa</i>, preceded
by an isthmus ending in the <i>Punta Marroquí</i>, the southmost
point of the mainland of Europe (36° N. lat.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamers then pass the <i>Punta Canales</i> and <i>Punta del
Fraile</i>, round the <i>Punta Carnero</i>, the southmost spur of the <i>Sierra
de los Gazules</i>, and enter the broad <i>Bay of Algeciras</i> or <i>Gibraltar</i>,
where they usually anchor in the open roads of <i>Gibraltar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>),
to the N.W. of the government harbour.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Gibraltar to <i>Tangier</i> and <i>Mogador</i>, see RR. 6 b and 14; to

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Arrival by Sea.</span> Steamers arriving from Europe (comp. R. 1) usually
anchor in the Tagus (Tejo) near the custom-house (Alfándega; Pl. F,
G, 5). Landing or embarking by boat (<i>bote</i>) ca. 500 rs., and 100–200 rs.
for each trunk or package, including transport to the custom-house
(bargaining necessary). Steamers from the South (Madeira and Brazil),
cast anchor opposite the quarantine station (Posto Maritimo de Desinfecção;
Pl. B, 5); passengers are landed in tenders (1600 rs.); for conveyance of
luggage to the custom-house each piece 200 rs. As soiled linen is sometimes
asked for, it should be packed in a separate bundle and given up in
exchange for a metal token. A declaration has to be filled up at the
custom-house (100 rs.); tobacco and unused articles only are dutiable. In
the case of the larger liners the through-passengers (<i>passageiros em
transito</i>) are conveyed without luggage to land, and thence back, by
tender; the place and time of return should be ascertained. Special
tenders are provided for the landing of travellers going no farther, and
for their luggage. As a rule, fully half a day is spent in landing and
other formalities prior to settling down in a hotel. Hotel-employés are
not permitted to convey passengers from the steamers. As the custom-house
is closed at sunset, passengers arriving by steamer in the evening
must stay on board till next morning.</p>

<div class='footnote c024' id='f4'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. <span class='sc'>Money.</span> The monetary unit in Portugal is the <i>real</i> (equal to 0.549
of a centime, or roughly ¹⁄₂₀ of a penny or ⅒ of a cent), which is used,
however, in multiples (<i>reis</i>) only. The copper coins are 5 rs., 10 rs.,
and 20 rs. (<i>vintem</i>, pl. <i>vintens</i>). In nickel there are pieces of 50 and
100 rs. (<i>tostão</i>, pl. <i>tostões</i>). In silver there are coins of 200, 500 (<i>corõa</i>),
and 1000 rs. (<i>um milreis</i>, worth about 5 fr. or 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> or $1). Gold is never
met with in ordinary traffic. The banknotes are for 5000 rs., 10,000 rs.,
and 20,000 rs. A sum of 1000 milreis is called <i>um conto da reis</i>.—Small
amounts are often reckoned in <i>tostões</i> and <i>vintens</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Lisbon</i>, Portuguese <i>Lisbóa</i>, the capital of the new republic of
Portugal (comp. p. <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>), the see of an archbishop, a fortress, and
also an important commercial city, with 357,700 inhab., lies in
38° 42′ N. lat. and 9° 11′ W. long., on the broad <i>Bay of the Tagus</i>,
which forms an excellent harbour just above the comparatively
narrow (1–2 M.) mouth of the river (see p. xxix). The town rises
in picturesque terraces, affording many charming views, while the
luxuriance of its public gardens is almost unrivalled in Europe.
Lisbon is certainly a very beautiful city, and its ardent admirers
have compared it even with Naples and Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town, which is girdled by the <i>Estrada da Circumvallação</i>,
a road 5 M. long, consists of several quarters. On the E. lies the
old town, or <i>Lisboa Oriental</i>, on the slope of the <i>Collina do Castello</i>.
On the low ground between the old town and the new is the
<i>Cidade Baixa</i>, which has sprung up since the earthquake of 1755.
To the W. is <i>Lisboa Occidental</i>, the modern quarter. Along the
Tagus extend quays and docks, constructed in 1887, and, after a
serious collapse, restored in 1894–1905. The harbour is entered
by 5000 vessels annually, one-third of them being under the British
flag, one-tenth under the French, and one tenth under the German.
The Portuguese vessels are chiefly engaged in trading with the
country’s African colonies and with S. America.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ancient name of Lisbon was <i>Ulisipo</i> or <i>Olisipo</i>, which led early
Greek travellers and scholars to connect the place, but erroneously, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the legends of Ulysses. Under the Romans, thanks to its splendid harbour,
it ranked as the second city in Lusitania, and alternately with Mérida,
the capital, was frequently the residence of the Roman governors. From
407 to 585 it was occupied by the Alans, and from 585 to 715 by the
Visigoths, and after the battle of Veger de la Frontera (711) it fell into
the hands of the Moors, who called it <i>Aloshbuna</i> or <i>Lishbuna</i>. In 1147
it was retaken by king <i>Affonso Henriques</i>, aided by an army of Crusaders.
The bulk of these were Englishmen; and thus the siege of Lisbon is
doubly interesting as it was ‘the first instance of the close connection
between the two nations (England and Portugal) which has lasted down
to the present century’ (H. M. Stephens).</p>

<p class='c022'>The importance of Lisbon began under <i>Affonso III.</i> (1248–79), who
transferred the royal residence hither from Coimbra (1260). The great
discoveries made by the Portuguese at the end of the 15th cent., and
the conquest of India by <i>Francisco d’Almeida</i> (d. 1510) and <i>Affonso de
Albuquerque</i> (d. 1515), greatly benefited the capital, which soon became
the richest town in Europe, and recovered rapidly even from the effects
of the earthquakes of 1531 and 1575. But the sixty years of Spanish
dominion (1580–1640), the defeats of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets
in the war with Holland, and the loss of India were severe trials. The
earthquake of 1755 laid half the city in ruins. The beginning of the
19th cent. brought the French invasion, the removal of the royal residence
to Rio de Janeiro, the Peninsular War, the loss of Brazil, and the utter
decadence of Lisbon. Since the period of revolutions, and since the
partial bankruptcy of the country in 1892, Lisbon has again risen from
a state of decay to be a great and handsome city, thanks largely to the
initiative of the German <i>Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Kohary</i>,
consort of <i>Queen Maria II.</i>, and to his sons, <i>Pedro V.</i> (1853–61) and
<i>Luis I.</i> (1861–89). Party strife in the next reign led to the dictatorship
of the minister <i>João Franco</i>, and on 1st Feb. 1908 Lisbon witnessed the
assassination of <i>Carlos I.</i> and the crown-prince <i>Luis Philippe</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>).
Carlos’s second son then ascended the throne as <i>Manuel II.</i> He had,
however, only reigned two years when the establishment of the Republic
forced him to go into exile (5th Oct., 1910). President of the provisional
government <i>Theophilo Braga</i>. The republican colours are green and red.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. Cidade Baixa, Lisboa Occidental and Oriental.</h4>

<p class='c021'>Most of the public buildings in Lisbon, erected almost exclusively
after the earthquake of 1755, are situated in the <b>Praça
do Commercio</b> (Pl. F, 5). In the centre of the square rises an
<i>Equestrian Statue of Joseph I.</i> (1750–77); on the S. side is the
<i>Caes das Columnas</i>, a quay affording a superb view of the bay of
the Tagus, with its busy shipping, and of the S. bank (Outra Banda),
with the castle-hill of Palmella in the distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of this square begins the rectangularly planned
<b>Cidade Baixa</b> (‘lower city’), once a bay of the Tagus, the three
chief streets of which, running to the N., are the Rua Augusta,
spanned by a triumphal arch, the Rua d’Ouro or Aurea (to the left),
and the Rua da Prata (to the right). These streets afford interesting
glimpses of the towering masses of the houses of Lisboa Occidental
(to the left), with the Carmo church, and of Lisboa Oriental
(to the right), with the cathedral and the castle of St. George. At
the N. end of the Rua Augusta and the Rua Aurea lies the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Praça de Dom Pedro Quarto</span> (Pl. F, 3, 4), commonly called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><b>O Rocío</b>, one of the chief tramway stations (p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>). Owing to the
peculiar wavy pattern of its mosaic pavement the Rocio has received
from the British sailors the nickname ‘Roly-poly Square’.
The square is adorned with two bronze fountains and a marble
column bearing a bronze <i>Statue of Pedro IV.</i> (d. 1834; emperor
of Brazil, 1826–31). Above the S.W. corner of the square rises
on massive substructures the picturesque ruined church of <i>Igreja
do Carmo</i>, destroyed by the earthquake of 1755. We may reach
it by the ‘ascensor’ No. 1 (p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>). On the N. side rises the <i>Theatro
Nacional</i> (p. <a href='#Page_8'>8</a>). The <i>Market</i> in the adjacent Praça da Figueira
(Pl. F, 4), to the E., deserves a visit in the early morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the W. side of the theatre we proceed past the <i>Central
Station</i> (p. <a href='#Page_6'>6</a>) to the *<b>Avenida da Liberdade</b> (Pl. F, E, 3–1),
a magnificent promenade, 100 yds. wide and more than ½ M. long,
with luxuriant vegetation, especially palms, and affording charming
views. It is most frequented on Sundays and holidays towards evening,
when the fashionable world may be seen driving and riding. At
the beginning of the Avenida is the Praça dos Restauradores, with
the <i>Monumento dos Restauradores de Portugal</i>, recalling the revolt
of 1640, when the yoke of the Spanish ‘Intrusos’ was shaken off.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the left, at the beginning of the Avenida Promenade, is the
steep Calçada da Gloria, through which a funicular tramway (No. 2;
p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>) ascends to the *<b>Alameda de São Pedro de Alcántara</b>
(Pl. E, F, 3), where we enjoy a magnificent view of the bay, to the
S., and of Lisboa Oriental, with St. George’s Castle and the churches
of Graça and do Monte (p. <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>), to the E. Far below lie the Avenida
da Liberdade, the Central Station, the Rocio, and the Baixa.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the S. angle of the gardens the Rua do Mundo (Pl. E,
F, 3, 4) descends to the Largo da Misericordia, and past the Jesuit
church of <i>São Roque</i>, a sumptuous late-Renaissance edifice by Fil.
Terzi, an Italian architect (1566), to the Praça de Luis de Camões
(p. <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>). We proceed, however, to the N.W. of the Alameda and
follow the Rua de Dom Pedro Quinto to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Praça do Rio de Janeiro</span> (Pl. E, 2, 3), with a fountain and
attractive pleasure-grounds, occupying the highest site in <b>Lisboa
Occidental</b>. From the W. angle of the grounds we obtain a fine
view of the Estrella church (p. <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>) and the Tagus.</p>

<p class='c011'>Proceeding in the same direction we next follow the <i>Rua da
Escola Polytechnica</i> to the <span class='sc'>Polytechnic School</span> (Pl. E, 2), which
comprises an interesting <i>Natural History Museum</i> (entrance on
the N.W. side), an <i>Observatory</i>, and a <i>Meteorological Station</i>.
To the Polytechnic belongs also the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Botanic Garden</b> (Pl. E, 2; open to the public), founded in
1875, and for luxuriance of vegetation the finest in Europe. The
lower part of the garden contains a magnificent avenue of palms
and numerous southern plants. It is reached by a road from the S.E.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>angle of the Polytechnic, and there is a side-entrance in the Rua
Nova da Alegria. In the upper part are the <i>Estufas</i> or greenhouses.</p>

<p class='c011'>We descend to a lower exit of the garden opening into the
Avenida, cross the latter and ascend by the Ascensor da Lavra
(p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>) to the E. town. From the <i>Campo dos Martyres da Patria</i>
(Pl. F, G, 2), the terminus of the funicular, the tramway ‘Santo
André’ (infrequent service), or the circular line ‘Graça’ below its
E. side, lead to the Rua da Palma (funicular No. 4, p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>). Thereafter
through Lisboa Oriental, see below.</p>

<p class='c016'>We may travel also by the ‘Graça’ tramway (in returning called
‘Rua Gomes Freire’) in the reverse direction, starting from the Sé Patriarchal
and proceeding to the Nossa Senhora da Graça church on the
way out, and descend by the funicular.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Botanic Garden the ‘Estrella’ tramway brings us
viâ the <span class='sc'>Largo do Rato</span> (Pl. D, 1) to the <i>Aqueducto das Aguas
Livres</i>, constructed in 1729–49. It leads us farther to <i>Buenos
Ayres</i>, the high-lying W. quarter of the city, to the vicinity of the
cemeteries, and to the <i>Jardim da Estrella</i> (Pl. C, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Estrella Church</b> (Pl. C, 3), officially known as the <i>Basilica
do Santissimo Coração de Jesús</i>, was built in 1779–96. It
is crowned with a lofty dome over the crossing, and its interior
is sumptuously fitted up.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<span class='sc'>Ascent of the Dome</span> (entrance by 5th door on the right; fee
100 rs.) amply repays the fatigue. The stairs in the N.W. tower ascend
first to the flat roof of the church, where we already have a fine view.
We then pass through the double lining of the dome into a gallery surrounding
its interior. A ladder finally leads to the <i>Lantern</i>, the view
from which (best in the afternoon) is the most extensive in Lisbon and
includes the whole of the city, the S. bank of the estuary, and the ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Jardim da Estrella is flanked on the W. by the Rua da
Estrella which ascends to the <b>English Cemetery</b> (<i>Cemiterio
dos Inglezes</i>; Pl. C, 2; visitors ring; fee 50–100 rs.), laid out in
1717, the oldest Protestant burial-ground in Portugal. It contains
the grave of <i>Henry Fielding</i> (1707–54), author of the immortal
‘Tom Jones’. Here too is the <i>English Church</i> (p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>To return from this point we take the funicular No. 3 (p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>),
past the <i>Palacio das Côrtes</i> (Pl. D, 3; Chamber of Deputies),
to the <span class='sc'>Praça de Luis de Camões</span> (Pl. E, 4; pron. Kamŏengsh),
which is embellished with a monument of the famous poet <i>Camões</i>
(1524–80), the author of the Lusiads, a great national epic celebrating
the noble deeds of his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Praça de Camões we return through the <span class='sc'>Rua Garrett</span>
and the Rua do Carmo (Pl. F, 4), the busiest streets in the town,
with the best shops, to the Rocio (p. <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>Time permitting, we may now pay a short visit to <b>Lisboa
Oriental</b>, which is best reached by the funicular line No. 4 (p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>From the terminus in the Largo da Graça (Pl. H, 3, 4) we pass round
the old Graça monastery (now barracks) to the church of—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Nossa Senhora da Graça</span> (Pl. G, H, 3, 4; 262 ft.), situated on
a hill which affords a fine view of Lisboa Occidental and the lower
town, while the harbour is concealed by St. George’s Castle (see
below).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to the barracks just mentioned and enter the
Rua da Graça to the N., whence the Travessa do Monte leads immediately
to the left to the (5 min.) chapel of <span class='sc'>Nossa Senhora do
Monte</span> (Pl. G, H, 3; 328 ft.). The extensive *View from this point
embraces the greater part of Lisbon, the harbour, the S. bank, and
the region to the N.E. as far as Santarém.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Rua da Graça the circular tramway ‘Rua Gomes
Freire’ descends to the old Augustinian monastery of <b>São Vicente
de Fóra</b> (Pl. H, 4), now the seat of the Patriarch of Lisbon. The
church, a late-Renaissance building of 1582, lost its dome in the
earthquake of 1755. The cloisters contain the <i>Pantheon Real</i>, the
burial-place of the Portuguese monarchs of the House of Braganza
from the time of John IV. (d. 1656) onwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>We take the same circular tramway-line as far as the Largo do
Contador Mór (Pl. G, 4). Thence we walk through the Travessa do
Funil to the Rua do Chão de Feira, and through the St. George’s
Gateway to the <span class='sc'>Castello de São Jorge</span> (Pl. G, 4), an ancient
Moorish stronghold and once a royal residence, but now used as
barracks and a military prison, where we apply at the guard-house
for leave to see the fine view from the S. Terrace. If so disposed
we may descend to the cathedral, which stands about halfway up
the castle-hill and is known as the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Sé Patriarchal</b> (Pl. G, 5), the oldest church in Lisbon, founded
in 1150, but rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 14th cent., and almost
entirely modernized after the earthquake of 1755. From the
cathedral the Rua da Conceição brings us back to the lower town.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The Streets on the Tagus. Belem.</h4>

<p class='c021'>In the Rua da Alfándega, a few paces to the E. of the Praça do
Commercio (p. <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>), rises the church of—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Nossa Senhora da Conceição Velha</b> (Pl. ‘C.V.’; G, 5).
The *Façade, in the richest ‘Emmanuel style’ (see p. <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>), is a
relic of the church of <i>Nossa Senhora da Misericordia</i>, which was
destroyed by the earthquake of 1755. A little farther on, between
Nos. 42 and 44 we get a glimpse of the <i>Casa dos Bicos</i>, built in
the 16th cent. by Braz, a son of Affonso de Albuquerque (p. <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>).
It derives its name from the facetted stones of the façade (‘bico’
meaning beak or point). All the electric tramways proceed farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to the <i>Arsenal do Exército</i> (Pl. H, 4, 5), containing the <i>Artillery
Museum</i> on the first floor (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the N.W. corner of the Praça do Commercio, where king
Carlos and the crown-prince were brutally assassinated in 1908, the
Rua do Arsenal leads to the Largo do Municipio (Pl. F, 5), in the
centre of which stands a so-called <i>Pelourinho</i>, or pillory, as a symbol
of the civic jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramway ‘Santo Amaro Pampueha’ passes the <b>Museu
Nacional das Bellas Artes</b> (Pl. B, C, 4; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>), Rua
das Janellas Verdes 57, which contains art-industrial collections
and a picture-gallery. (Note in Room G, on the N. wall, No. 282,
St. Jerome, by <i>Alb. Dürer</i>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The outer line, skirting the Tagus and affording fine views,
passes the <i>Mercado</i>, or fish-market (Pl. E, 5), which is worth seeing
in the early morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two ‘Belem’ tramway-lines (Algés and Dafundo) lead through
the suburb of <i>Junqueira</i> to that of <b>Belem</b> (Brit. vice-consul,
C. J. F. Duff). The Praça de Dom Fernando with a bronze statue,
13 ft. in height, of Affonso de Albuquerque (p. <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>) is adjoined on
the N. by the <span class='sc'>Paço de Belem</span>. In the S.E. corner of the building
is the <i>Museu Nacional dos Coches</i> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>), with about
thirty historical state-carriages.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther to the W. we reach in 5 min. the <span class='sc'>Praça de Vasco da
Gama</span>, with the famous—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Convento dos Jeronymos de Belem</b> (Bethlehem; tramway
from the Praça do Commercio, Pl. F5, in ca. ½ hr.). This
Hieronymite monastery, founded in 1499 in memory of Vasco da
Gama’s voyage of discovery, but used as an orphanage (<i>Casa Pia</i>)
since 1834, is still, in spite of infelicitous alterations, the most
brilliant example of the fantastic ‘Emmanuel style’ (Arte Manuelina),
of the time of Emmanuel I. the Great, a picturesque blend of
late-Gothic, Moorish, and Renaissance features with <i>motifs</i> from
the gorgeous edifices of the East Indies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The church of <i>Santa Maria</i>, at the S.E. angle of the monastery,
the burial-place of king Emmanuel and his successors, has
a superb portal by João de Castilho (sculptured by Nicholas ‘the
Frenchman’), which, according to Mr. Fergusson, resembles in
design and detail the chapel at Roslin (see Baedeker’s Great
Britain). The church is open from early morning till 9, and also
after 2.30 p.m.—Adjoining the W. portal of the church is the
entrance (where we ring; fee 100–150 rs.) to the orphanage and to
the grand *<i>Cloisters</i>, the master-work of João de Castilho.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Tagus, about ½ M. to the S.W. of the monastery, rises
the *<b>Tower of Belem</b> (<i>Torre de Belem</i>), erected in 1520 to
guard the mouth of the river (best viewed at a distance).</p>

  <h4 class='c023'>c. Excursion to Cintra.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>17½ <span class='sc'>M. Railway</span> (in ¾–1 hr.). Nine expresses in summer, besides
several slow trains (tranvias), but fewer in winter (fares 530, 360, 230 rs.),
starting from the <i>Central Station</i> (p. <a href='#Page_6'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The train passes through a tunnel 1½ M. long to (3¾ M.)
<i>Campolide</i> in the valley of the Alcántara. To the left are the arches
of the aqueduct (p. <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>). At (13 M.) <i>Cacem</i> our line diverges to
the left from the railway to Alfarellos (Coimbra and Oporto).</p>

<p class='c011'>The country becomes more hilly; eucalypti, pines, and olives
abound. To the left rise the hills of Cintra.</p>

<p class='c016'>17½ <b>M. Cintra.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotels.</span> *<i>Gr.-Hôt. Costa</i>, <i>Netto</i>, <i>Lawrence</i>,
<i>Nunes</i>, <i>Central</i>, déj. or D. 800 rs., some closed in winter.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Tramway</span> from the station (to the left of the exit) to the Praça da
Republica (20 rs.).—<span class='sc'>Cabs</span> (good; with two horses) to the Castello da Pena
2500 rs.; to the Quinta do Monserrate and back, 2000 rs.; but lower fares
are often accepted on application to the cab-owner himself.</p>

<p class='c022'>If time presses, we may visit both the Castello da Pena and the
Quinta de Monserrate in 4–5 hrs. (cab 4500 rs., bargaining advisable).
Energetic pedestrians require scarcely more time. Donkeys, only to be
recommended to gentlemen travelling alone, are a doubtful advantage,
nor will those in haste find the services of drivers or guides of much
avail; the usual price, after bargaining, is 400–500 rs. But it is more
enjoyable to devote a forenoon to the Castello da Pena, and the afternoon
to the Paço de Cintra and the Quinta.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Cintra</i> (680 ft.; pop. 5000), a favourite summer resort, lies at
the N. base of the granitic <i>Serra de Cintra</i>, on a spur between
two ravines, amidst groves of evergreen oaks and pines, and surrounded
by charming country-houses. Immediately above the little
town rises a steep rock, crowned by the Moorish castle. Beyond
this rises the Pena with the palace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The centre of traffic is the Praça da Republica, with its late-Gothic
<i>Pelourinho</i> (p. <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>) and the main entrance to the palace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Paço de Cintra</b>, formerly the <i>Royal Palace</i>, was
begun by John I. (1383–1433) on the foundations of a Moorish
palace and completed early in the 16th cent. by Emmanuel the Great.
The older parts, built by Moorish hands, show a mingling of
Moorish and late-Gothic elements, while the newer parts, particularly
the E. wing, are in the ‘Emmanuel style’ (p. <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>). The most
characteristic features of the exterior are two conspicuous conical
kitchen-chimneys, the horseshoe and toothed arches of the Moorish
windows, and the Moorish battlemented parapet. The mural tiles
and the honeycombed wooden ceilings in the interior are other
survivals of the Moorish period. Visitors are shown round by the
castellan.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Avenida Candido dos Reis, the road leading to the S. from
the Largo of that name, brings us in ¾ hr. to the <i>Castello dos
Mouros</i> (1408 ft.). The castle consists of two parts, to which a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>double wall, much modernized, ascends. A visit to it takes more
time than travellers in a hurry can afford.</p>

<p class='c011'>About ¼ hr. farther on we reach the Porta Principal of the
<i>Park of Pena</i>, where we alight (cameras must be given up). The
officials are not allowed to act as guides; the services of others
should be declined. The park contains over 400 species of trees
and shrubs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Castello da Pena</b> (1732 ft.), perched on a steep rocky
hill, was built in 1840–50 in the style of a mediæval castle, partly
within an old monastery, by the Prince-Consort Ferd. of Coburg.
The main tower is a copy of the tower of Belem (p. <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>). The castle
is approached by two gates and a cutting in the rock (‘corredor’).
The ‘galeria’ of the castle affords delightful views.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the <span class='sc'>Interior</span> (adm. free) we pass through the Vestibule, with a
pyramidal tower, into the old Convent Church, with its superb Renaissance
altar brought from Belem, and into the two-storied cloisters. The
apartments contain many pictures (including an example of Adr. Brouwer)
and costly Hispano-Moorish majolicas. The ‘Sala de Veados’ is embellished
with stags’ antlers. The *<span class='sc'>Dome</span> above it is perhaps the finest point of
view in the Serra de Cintra, but its ascent requires a steady head. The
eye ranges over Estremadura, from Cape Espichel on the S.E. to the Berlengas
Islands (p. <a href='#Page_4'>4</a>) on the N. To the N.E. rises the huge façade of the
palace of Mafra. To the E. we obtain glimpses of Lisbon and the plain
to the S. of the Tagus. To the S. rises the summit of the Cruz Alta,
and to the W. lies the boundless Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now enter the <i>Jardim das Camelias</i> or castle-garden,
where the camellias, rhododendrons, and azaleas present a marvellous
wealth of blossom in spring; then, passing a well and
several fish-ponds, we soon reach a side-exit from the grounds,
where the carriage should be ordered to meet us.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<b>Cruz Alta</b> (1736 ft.), the highest of the Cintra hills, which
affords a view similar to that from the dome of the castle, may be
ascended in 20 min. by a path diverging in the park to the S., near the
Porta Principal, and passing the <i>Statue of Vasco da Gama</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A favourite walk near Cintra is the *<i>Caminho de Collares</i>
skirting the hills. This road, bordered with beautiful evergreens,
leads past charming country-houses (the <i>Penha Verde</i> and others).
On the right, about 2 M. from Cintra, is the famous—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Quinta de Monserrate</b> (adm. 200, on Sun. and holidays
300 rs.), the property of Sir Fred. Cook, Visconde de Monserrate.
The grounds, a visit to which takes 1–2 hrs., extend far over
hill and dale, and are unique in Europe in magnificence of vegetation.
From the entrance we turn to the left, cross a brook, and
follow its left bank, where we enjoy a delightful view of the palace
beyond the lofty tree-ferns. We then pass an artificial ruin, walk
round the palace (no adm.), and re-ascend to the entrance.</p>

(p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>) call once monthly at Madeira, and the Transports Maritimes (p. <a href='#Page_120'>120</a>)
occasionally touch at Madeira.</p>

<p class='c022'>The communication between Madeira and the Canary Islands (R. 4) is
very defective.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Archipelago da Madeira</i>, or Madeira group of islands,
consists of <i>Madeira</i> itself, the largest of the group, 37 by 14 M.,
<i>Porto Santo</i> (rising 1663 ft. above the sea), 6½ by 3 M., which
lies 26½ M. to the N.E. of Madeira, and the three uninhabited
<i>Desertas</i>. These are the islets of <i>Chão</i> (341 ft.), 12½ M. to the
S.E. of Madeira, <i>Deserta Grande</i> (1611 ft.), and <i>Bugio</i> (1349 ft.).
Madeira lies in 33° N. lat., between the Azores and the Canary Islands
(R. 4), 620 M. to the S.W. of Lisbon, 370 M. to the N.W. of
Cape Juby (p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>), and 275 M. to the N. of Teneriffe (p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>). The
population of the islands, which are said to have been uninhabited
when discovered by the Portuguese in 1419, is now, in an area of
314 sq. M., about 150,000. All the islands are of volcanic origin.
In Madeira, above the primæval diabase rock (p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>), numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>eruptions since the miocene epoch have formed a number of extinct
craters (lagoas), and as in the Canaries have raised the soil 1150 ft.
above its original level. The main ridge of the island, running from
W. to E., and culminating in the Pico Ruivo (‘red peak’; 6060 ft.),
frequently rises in rocky pinnacles. In examining the geological
structure of the island one is struck with ‘the constant mingling of
solid masses of basalt and lava with strata of loose tufa and ashes,
the whole being interspersed with upright dykes of lava’. The
only tablelands are the <i>Paul da Serra</i>, on the W., and the smaller
<i>Santo Antonio da Serra</i>, on the E. On the S. and N. slopes of the
central range we observe a series of very curious and grand basins
(<i>curraes</i>, sing. <i>curral</i>), which are enclosed by high rocks, and are
connected with the sea by deep ravines, testifying to the enormous
erosion caused by water and wind. Narrow strips of coast, strewn
with rounded fragments of basalt, occur only at the mouths of the
few streams, and on the largest of these lies <i>Funchal</i>, the capital
of the island, on its S.W. margin.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mild and wonderfully equable climate of Madeira which
since 1850 has attracted numberless invalids, chiefly English, to
its shores, is due partly to its southern position, tempered by the
surrounding ocean, but mainly to the influence of the Gulf Stream,
which sends from the Azores an offshoot, known as the Canary
branch, towards the African coast. On the sunny S. coast in
particular, which is free from fog and is sheltered from the prevailing
N.W. wind by the above-mentioned main ridge, the mean
and almost unvarying temperature of the three winter months (at
Funchal 61° Fahr.; minimum 50°) is considerably higher than that
of the favourite Mediterranean resorts (Nice 48° Fahr., Ajaccio 52°,
Algiers 54½°, Málaga 55°), while the summer temperature is
lower (at Funchal in Aug. 70½°, maximum 92°). Dust is almost
unknown. The rainfall (at Funchal 27½ inches; but more in the
mountains and on the N. coast), chiefly in sudden and heavy showers,
occurs mostly between October and February or March. The lowest
snow-line is 1970 ft. above the sea. The relative moisture of the
air (67 per cent) at Funchal is moderate, notwithstanding the
proximity of the sea. As in the Canaries, the mountains are generally
cloud-capped about midday, except during the prevalence
of the <i>Leste</i>, the wind blowing from the African desert (p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>),
which in Madeira is not specially unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thanks to the genial climate, the abundant winter rains, and the
system of irrigation by means of open channels (<i>levadas</i>), whereby
water is brought down, partly through tunnels (<i>furos</i>), from its
mountain sources, the fields and gardens of Madeira, ‘Flor do
Océano’, show an almost tropical luxuriance of vegetation. Side by
side with pines, junipers, and deciduous European trees, such as
the plane, the chestnut, the maple, the oak, and the walnut, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>which there are many splendid specimens, are seen countless evergreen
trees and shrubs of tropical and subtropical origin. Among
these are palms, araucarias, hickory-trees, cork-trees, camphor-trees,
figs, palm-lilies (yuccas; p. <a href='#Page_233'>233</a>), magnolias, eucalypti, bamboos,
papyrus-bushes, tree-ferns, and aloes. A few isolated dragon-trees
(p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>), the laurel (<i>vinhatico</i>), and the tilwood tree (Oreodaphne
fœtens), a kind of bay-tree scarcely occurring elsewhere, are survivals
of the primæval forest destroyed by the Portuguese discoverers,
and now lingering only in the remote ravines and on the
slopes of the N. coast. To that forest the island owes its name
(madeira, ‘wood’; <i>Isŏla di Legname</i> on old Italian charts). The
hill-sides are now largely clothed with tree-like erica and broom
(Genista madeirense, G. virgata, furze, etc.), large bilberry-bushes
(Vaccinium madeirense), stemless ferns, and box, forming a kind of
evergreen underwood. In the gardens of Funchal, enclosed by high
walls, the traveller feasts his eyes, especially in May, on a most
exuberant flora, comprising roses, rhododendrons, azaleas, camellias,
callas, bignonias, daturas, fuchsias, hydrangeas, honeysuckle,
and a superb red and purple bougainvillea. The garden-walls,
field-roads, and hill-terraces are everywhere overgrown with vines,
but, as in the Canary Islands, the wine-culture has suffered since
1852 from the grape-disease (Oïdium Tuckeri) and from the competition
of port-wine (p. <a href='#Page_4'>4</a>). Among favourite brands are <i>Malvasia</i>
or <i>Malmsey</i>, a sweet dessert-wine, <i>Boal</i>, and the astringent <i>Sercial</i>.
Like the Vega of Málaga (p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>), the S. coast of Madeira
yields the sugar-cane, which forms the chief crop of the island,
bananas, sweet potatoes (p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>; Portug. <i>batata doce</i>), cherimolias,
coffee-plants, yams (Dioscorea batatas; Portug. <i>inhame</i>), and early
vegetables, which last are exported chiefly to England. Pine-apples
thrive in hot-houses only. The natives live mostly on maize and
the fruit of a kind of cactus (Opuntia Tuna) which grows abundantly
on all the rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Madeira also possesses several charming home-industries, producing
embroidery, lace, silk shawls, basket-work, inlaid laurel-wood,
and feather-flowers. Funchal, the only considerable harbour
in the island, is an important coaling and provisioning station for
steamers bound for S. Africa and for America. The heavy customs-dues,
which render living dear, the over-population of the island,
and the poverty of the peasantry cause a considerable emigration,
chiefly to S. America.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Season and Mode of Travel.</b> Madeira is an admirable health
and rest resort at all seasons, except perhaps for sufferers from neurasthenia
or gastric disorders; but in summer the Monte (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>) and
Camacha are preferable to the lower sites. Tourists, on the other hand,
will find July, Aug., and Sept, the best months for their purpose, as the
hotels are cheaper and less crowded, the days are long, and the dry
weather favours excursions into the interior. At Funchal English, French,
and in the larger hotels German are much spoken, but in the interior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Portuguese only. Those unacquainted with the language of the natives
are then dependent on the help of their horse-attendants (<i>arrieiros</i>) or
guides (<i>guias</i> or <i>chapas</i>), many of whom speak a little English. At the
principal hotels and shops English money is readily received, but small
Portuguese change is required for fees and other minor outlays. Beggars
abound, but their importunities should invariably be disregarded (comp.
also p. xxv).</p>

<p class='c022'>The streets of Funchal and the hill-roads are paved with round and
slippery cobbles of basalt, against which india-rubber heels afford protection.
The most popular vehicles are the bullock-cars (<i>carros de bois</i>;
seated for 4 persons; 400–1000 rs. per hour). For steep descents the <i>carro
do monte</i> or <i>carrinho</i>, a kind of running sledge, is employed (400–1200 rs.
per drive). The longer excursions on the extremely hilly routes so characteristic
of Madeira are best taken on horseback. The horses of Andalusian
race are wonderfully wiry and sure-footed (per hour 500 rs.;
<i>arrieiro</i>, or attendant, 800–1000 rs. per day). Ladies and invalids use
the hammock or litter (<i>rede</i>), a costly conveyance (2–4 bearers, at 500–600
rs. each per hour). Finger-posts are entirely lacking.</p>

<p class='c022'>The few <i>Vendas</i>, or country-inns, and the houses of the mountain
engineers (to which travellers are admitted by leave from the office of
the Obras Publicas at Funchal, Rua do Conselheiro Vieira 80) afford very
primitive quarters. Travellers should therefore be provided with rugs,
preserved meats, candles, insect-powder, and good drinking-water. As in
the Alps, strong boots with nails and a <i>hasta</i> or <i>bordão</i>, a long stick
with an iron spike, are desirable for mountaineering.</p>

<p class='c022'>Among <span class='sc'>Books</span> on Madeira may be mentioned <i>A. Samler Brown’s</i>
Guide to Madeira, the Canary Islands, and the Azores (10th ed., London,
1910; 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>); Leaves from a Madeira Garden, by <i>Chas. Thomas-Stanford</i>
(London, 1910; 5<i>s.</i>); <i>Yate Johnson’s</i> Handbook of Madeira (London, 1885);
Madeira, by <i>Ellen M. Taylor</i> (2nd ed., London, 1889); Madeira Islands, by
<i>A. J. D. Biddle</i> (2nd ed., London, 1900; 2 vols.); Madeira, Old and New,
by <i>W. H. Koebel</i> (London, 1909; 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>); The Flowers and Gardens of
Madeira, by the <i>Misses Du Cane</i> (London, 1909; 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Steamers</span> arriving from the N. skirt the W. coast of <b>Porto
Santo</b> (p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>), an island in the form of a tableland, surrounded
by five reef-islets; its inhabitants (about 2300) live mostly in the
little town of <i>Villa Baleira</i>. Beyond Porto Santo we obtain a
superb view of the abrupt and furrowed N. coast of Madeira,
with the curiously shaped Penha d’Aguia (p. <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on appears the long E. promontory of Madeira, a rocky
peninsula worn by the surf, and connected with the islet of <i>Ponta
de São Lourenço</i> by a grand rocky gateway called the <i>Ponta do
Furado</i>. We steer round the <i>Ilheo de Fora</i>, an outlying islet with
a lighthouse (<i>Farol</i>; 348 ft.), visible from a distance of 28 M.,
towards which the steamers from Lisbon, Gibraltar, and Morocco
direct their course, passing to the S. of Porto Santo.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S., beyond the low island of <i>Chão</i>, rise the <i>Deserta
Grande</i> and <i>Bugio</i>, the largest of the <b>Desertas</b> (p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>), a group
of islands deserted for lack of water, and now owned by Mr. C. J.
Cossart, of Madeira. British sportsmen desiring to shoot wild goats
there or hunt seals (Monachus albiventer) in the ocean-caves of the
Deserta Grande must obtain permission from the owner.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The thinly peopled and somewhat bare S.E. coast of Madeira,
with the three little harbours of <i>Caniçal</i>, <i>Machico</i>, and <i>Santa
Cruz</i>, shows clearly the geological formation of the island (comp.
pp. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, 18). Off <i>Porto Novo</i>, in particular, we are struck with the
rich colouring of the <i>Pico dos Iroses</i>, where the sombre basaltic
and lava rock contrasts with brick-red strata of ashes and blood-red
masses of slag.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very beautiful is the approach to the *<i>Bay of Funchal</i>, which
is bounded on the E. by the bold <i>Cabo do Garajão</i>, and on the
W. by the <i>Ponta da Cruz</i>, a spur of the <i>Pico da Ponta da Cruz</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>). From the narrow strip of coast the lanes of the old town
mount the steep hill-side between the three river-beds (which are
generally dry), while several groups of houses extend up to the
<i>Pico Fort</i> (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>) and the <i>Levada de Santa Luzia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>). Farther
up, stretching to the terrace of the <i>Monte</i> (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>), are gardens and
vineyards, from which peep many white <i>quintas</i> or country-houses.
On the plateau behind <i>Forte Ilheo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>) are seen the charming
gardens, with their tall araucarias, belonging to the W. suburb of
Funchal, the finest residential quarter. Of the barren mountains
in the background the highest peak visible from the sea is the
<i>Pico de Santo Antonio</i> (p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>), to the N.W. of the town.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Funchál.</b>—<span class='sc'>Arrival.</span> The steamers cast anchor in the open
roads, which are much exposed to the surf when the wind is from the
S. or S.W. The passenger’s luggage, including hand-bags and small
packages, is conveyed from the steamer, in charge of a <i>guarda fiscal</i>,
direct to the Alfándega, or custom-house (Pl. 1; C, D, 2). Tobacco, spirits,
and unused articles are specially dutiable. The charge for landing is
about 500 rs. for each person, but should be ascertained beforehand, with
the aid of the hotel-porter if necessary. In stormy weather passengers
are landed at the <i>Pontinha</i> (Pl. B, 3), a small pier beyond the Forte Ilheo.
At the custom-house a declaration has to be filled up, for which the fee
is 50 rs.; the luggage is then usually retained till midday, and when it
is finally cleared the passenger gives a receipt for it (250–300 rs. more).
For the transport of luggage to the hotel by bullock-car not more than
1000 rs. should be paid (an agreement should be made beforehand). The
Madeira clock is 59 min. behind Greenwich time.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Hotels</b> (mostly in the English style; almost all with beautiful
gardens; crowded from Dec. to April). In the W. suburb *<span class='sc'>Reid’s Palace

<p class='c009'><i>Funchal</i> (‘place of fennel’; pop. 25,800), situated in 32° 38′ N.
lat. and 16° 55′ W. long., the capital of Madeira and the seat of the
Portuguese governor and a bishop, is remarkable for the luxuriant
subtropical verdure of its public grounds and private gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>On the <span class='sc'>Praça da Rainha</span> (Pl. C, 2), the sea-promenade, where
we have a view of the Desertas (p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>), rise the <i>Palacio de São
Lourenço</i> (Pl. 10; the governor’s residence), several <i>Club Houses</i>,
and a signalling tower called the <i>Pilar de Benger</i> (Pl. 11; ‘Benger’s
Folly’). The <i>Varadoures Gate</i> (Pl. 12; D, 2), to the E. of the
custom-house, is the sole survival of a town-wall built by the
Spaniards early in the 17th cent.; adjacent is the <i>Fruit and Fish
Market</i> (Mercado; Pl. D, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite the pier (Caes; Pl. C, 2) the Entrada da Cidade, an
avenue of planes, leads to the <span class='sc'>Praça da Constituição</span> (Pl. 13; C, 2),
adorned with pleasure-grounds, in the centre of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjacent on the W. is the *<b>Jardim Municipal</b> (public park;
Pl. C, 2; evening concerts twice weekly, otherwise closed in the
evening), with its exuberant wealth of vegetation and flowers. On
the S. side is the <i>Theatre</i> (p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>).—To the E., in the Largo da
Sé, rises the insignificant <span class='sc'>Cathedral</span> (<i>Sé</i>; Pl. C, 2), with a fine
ceiling of Spanish juniper (Portuguese cedro).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the E. side of the park runs the Rua de São Francisco,
leading to the long <span class='sc'>Rua do Conselheiro Vieira</span> (Pl. B, C, 1, 2), or
Rua da Carreira the busiest street, at the N.W. end of which (on
the left) is the entrance to the <i>Protestant Cemetery</i> (Cemiterio
Britanico; Pl. 3, B 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the N. side of the Rua do Conselheiro Vieira we ascend
past the church of <i>São Pedro</i> (Pl. C, 1) and through the steep
Calçada de Santa Clara to the convent-church of <i>Santa Clara</i>
(Pl. B, C, 1), where Zarco, the discoverer of Madeira, is buried.—Farther
to the N. is the Calçada do Pico, whence the Rua do Castello
to the left leads to the old Spanish <b>Pico Fort</b> (Forte de São João
do Pico; Pl. B, 1), dating from 1632, famed for its *View.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the E. end of the Rua do Conselheiro Vieira we may now
cross the Largo do Collegio, with the <i>Jesuit Church</i> of that name
(Pl. C, 1), to the <i>Camara Municipal</i>, or town-hall (Pl. 2; C, 1), in
the Rua dos Ferreiros. At the lower end of the same street, not far
from the Cathedral, is the Largo de São Sebastião (Pl. 7; C, 2),
where the Saturday market is held.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crossing the neighbouring <i>Ribeira de Santa Luzia</i> we soon
reach the <i>Carmo Church</i> (Pl. 6; D, 1).—Along the Ribeira de
Santa Luzia ascends the horse-tramway (p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>) to the station of
the Monte railway, near which, to the E. (reached by the Rua do
Pombal, Pl. C 1), is the <i>Museum</i>, containing valuable natural
history collections and a large relief-map of the island. (Adm.
on application; donation to poor-box.)</p>

<p class='c011'>In the E. suburb of <i>Santa Maria Maior</i>, beyond the Ribeira
de Santa Luzia and the <i>Ribeira de João Gomes</i>, is the Campo de
Dom Carlos Primeiro (Pl. D, E, 2; drilling-ground), skirting the sea,
and partly planted with trees. The Spanish <i>Forte de São Thiago</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>(Pl. E, 2; now barracks), built in 1614, was dedicated to St. James
the Less (São Thiago Menor), the patron saint of Funchal. Near it
is the church of <i>Nossa Senhora do Soccorro</i> (Pl. E, 2), the scene
of a great procession on 1st May.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief streets of the <b>W. Suburb</b>, beyond the <i>Ribeira de
São João</i>, flanked with pretty villas, are the <span class='sc'>Rua da Imperatriz
Dona Maria</span> (Pl. B, 2) and the <span class='sc'>Rua da Imperatriz Dona Amelia</span>
(Pl. A, B, 3), which last ends at the Redondo (‘round space’) near
the <i>Ribeiro Secco</i>. On the S. side of the road are the <i>Cemetery</i>
(Cemiterio das Angustias; Pl. B, 2) and the <i>Casino Pavão</i> (Pl. B, 3),
with a beautiful garden extending to the abrupt coast, frequented
by English and American visitors. By the sea runs the Caminho da
Pontinha, leading to the <i>Pontinha</i> (p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>) and the harbour-battery
of <i>Forte Ilheo</i> (Pl. B, 3; ‘island fort’, Engl. <i>Loo Rock</i>).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> The <span class='sc'>Rack &#38; Pinion Railway</span> (p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>), which at Levada
station crosses the <i>Levada de Santa Luzia</i> and the beautiful
hill-promenade of that name, connects Funchal with the *<b>Monte</b>
(hotels, see p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>), a village on the hill at the back of the town,
with numerous villas nestling amidst beautiful groves of planes
and oaks. On a spur of the hill, close to the terminus of the railway
(extension projected), rises the pilgrimage-church of <i>Nossa
Senhora do Monte</i>, known by English visitors as the ‘Mount Church’
(1962 ft.). It is the scene of the Novena, a great nine-days’ church-festival
held in summer. The terrace of the church (68 steps)
commands a glorious *View of Funchal, the coast as far as the
Cabo Girão (p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>), and the blue ocean enlivened by its passing
ships. A little below the church is a sacred well.</p>

<p class='c016'>A little to the E. of the Monte is the <i>Curralinho</i> (‘little curral’), or
<i>Curral dos Romeiros</i> (‘pilgrims’ ravine’), overgrown with erica and vaccinium
(p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>). This miniature curral, a gorge of the <i>Ribeira de João
Gomes</i> (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>), gives a very imperfect idea of the grandeur of the rocky
ravines (p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>) of Madeira.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those who are pressed for time may descend to the town in 10–12
min. in a running sledge (p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>), by the <i>Caminho do Monte</i>; but
it is preferable to walk back (in 1½ hr.) by the level *<i>Caminho das
Tilias</i> which we reach by turning to the left above the church. After
about ¼ M., at the beautiful <i>Quinta Machado</i> (with a view-tower),
we descend to the left by the steep <i>Caminho dos Saltos</i> (if desired,
by running sledge ordered beforehand; 600 rs.). The route leads
to the S.W., past the <i>Quinta Olavo</i>, the <i>Levada de Santa Luzia</i>
(see above), and the <i>Quinta do Deão</i>, and then descends to the S.E.
through the plane-avenue on the <i>Ribeira de Santa Luzia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>A *Side-path leads, above the Quinta Olavo, to the right, across the
river-bed, to the church of <i>São Roque</i> (1139 ft.; view; bullock-car from
Funchal 800 rs.), whence we may descend by the steep Caminho de São
Roque to the <i>Pico Fort</i> and the <i>Clara Nunnery</i> (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The Rua da Imperatriz Dona Amelia (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>) is continued by
the *<i>Estrada Monumental</i>, a road which affords delightful views.
It leads from the <i>Ponte Monumental</i> (Pl. A, 3), a bridge across
the Ribeiro Secco, past a number of sugar-cane plantations and
vineyards, and, leaving the shore, proceeds to the S.W. above the
ocean-cave of <i>Forja</i> and the rocky islets of <i>Forja</i> and <i>Gorgolho</i>.
It then crosses the S. slope of the <i>Pico da Ponta da Cruz</i> (863 ft.;
*View), an old crater, near the promontory of that name (p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>),
and skirts the beautiful, but not very safe bathing-beach of <i>Praia
Formosa</i>. Farther to the W., in full view of the bold central range
backing the Gran Curral (see below), we cross the lower bridge of
the <i>Ribeira dos Soccorridos</i> and an old lava-stream to (5½ M.)
<b>Camara de Lobos</b> (which may be reached by motor-cab, p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>),
a strikingly picturesque fishing-village (pop. 6200) at the E. base
of the almost perpendicular *<i>Cabo Girão</i>, with a small natural harbour
(<i>Bahia</i>). The best wine in the island is yielded by the slopes
in the vicinity. Route to the <i>Gran Curral</i> by <i>Jardim da Serra</i>,
see p. <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to the Gran Curral</span>, on horseback or by litter
(p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>), takes nearly a whole day. We start early and take provisions
with us. From the W. suburb (p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>) we follow the Rua
das Maravilhas and the Caminho de Santo Antonio (Pl. A, 1, 2),
between garden-walls and vineyards, to the N.W. to the finely situated
village of (2 M.) <i>Santo Antonio</i> (985 ft.; bullock-car from
Funchal 800 rs.). We descend thence to the N.W. into the side-valley
of the <i>Ribeira do Vasco Gil</i>, with its pine-woods and rich
pastures, and soon obtain a view towards the W., extending to the
Cabo Girão (see above) and the Pico da Cruz (p. <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>). We next ascend
the steep side-valley of the <i>Ribeira da Lapa</i> to the (11 M.) <i>Serrado
Saddle</i> (Eira do Serrado; about 2900 ft.), on the N.E. margin
of the <i>Pico Serrado</i> (see below). From the top of the pass we
have a grand view into the great and well-watered basin of the
*<b>Gran Curral</b>, or <i>Curral das Freiras</i> (‘nuns’ valley’; once a
pasture belonging to the convent of Santa Clara), enclosed by the
lofty rocks of the central mountains. Far below us, above the rock-strewn
bed of the <i>Ribeira dos Soccorridos</i>, we descry the village
of <i>Livramento</i> (2018 ft.), with its little church and cypress-shaded

<p class='c011'>Those who do not care to face the rugged descent to Livramento,
and the steep clamber thence to the Bocca dos Namorados (p. <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>),
should now ascend the *<b>Pico Serrado</b> (3347 ft.; ‘sawn-off peak’),
whence we survey the mountain-range from the <i>Pico de Santo
Antonio</i> (5725 ft.) and <i>Pico Cidrão</i> (5551 ft.) to the <i>Pico Ruivo</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>), the <i>Pico Canario</i> (5500 ft.), and the <i>Pico Grande</i> (p. <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Longer, but still grander, is the excursion to the W. margin of
the Gran Curral. From the Estrada Monumental (see above) we turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to the N.W. past the <i>Quinta Nazareh</i>, nestling amidst araucarias,
to the (2 M.) village of <i>São Martinho</i> (765 ft.; bullock-car from
Funchal 800 rs.), situated among several old craters; we then cross,
to the W., the ravine of the Ribeira dos Soccorridos by the upper
bridge and mount in zigzags to the (7 M.) village of <i>Estreito</i>
(1510 ft.). Our route now ascends to the N. to the (8½ M.) *<i>Bocca
dos Namorados</i> (3445 ft.), with its beautiful chestnut-wood, where
we enjoy a superb view of the Gran Curral, and skirts the W. margin
of the <i>Pico dos Bodes</i> (3718 ft.) to the (10 M.) <i>Cova da Cevada</i>,
a basin affording a similar view. We next follow the top of the
hill to the N.W., between the Gran Curral and the E. side-valleys
of the <i>Ribeira Brava</i> (see below), to (13 M.) the *<i>Bocca dos
Corregos</i> (4466 ft.), a narrow ridge at the foot of the perpendicular
rocks of the <i>Pico Grande</i> or <i>Rocha Alta</i> (5420 ft.). An interesting
return-route is afforded by descending from the Cova da Cevada
across <i>Jardim da Serra</i> (2523 ft.) and past the <i>Pico da Cruz</i>
(3288 ft.) to <i>Camara de Lobos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to Rabaçal</span> can, if time presses, be accomplished
in one day. It is best to go by steamboat to Calheta (3 times weekly,
in 1½–2 hrs.; or a small private steamer may be hired of Messrs. Blandy
Bros., p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>). The steamer calls first at <i>Camara de Lobos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>), then
skirts the sombre rocky slopes of <i>Cabo Girão</i> and steers past <i>Fajãa dos
Padres</i>, a village famed for its wine, to the village of <i>Ribeira Brava</i> (inn),
where we obtain, through the curral of that name, a very striking glimpse
of the <i>Serra d’Agua</i> (4610 ft.) and the Pico Grande (see above). We next
pass the beach of <i>Lugar de Baixo</i>, formed by a landslip in 1803, the
beautiful cape, <i>Ponta do Sol</i>, and the village of <i>Magdalena</i>, peeping out
of vines and bananas amidst the grandest scenery of the S. coast.</p>

<p class='c022'>At the village of <b>Calheta</b> (bad landing-place; no inn) we may find
litters if desired (each man 800–1000 rs. per day), and we obtain provisions
and torches (fachos, at 50 rs.). We now walk chiefly through pine-wood
viâ <i>Salão</i> to the (1½ hr.) narrow and wet tunnel (about 650 yds. in length)
of the lower <i>Levada Nova do Rabaçal</i>. At the N. end of it we obtain
a very striking view of the highest part of the valley of the <i>Ribeira da
Janella</i>, richly wooded with evergreen, oaks and laurels. A path over the
rocks (which needs a steady head) connects this levada (or conduit) with
the upper <i>Levada Velha</i>, constructed in 1836–60, and with (9½ M.) the
engineers’ houses of <b>Rabaçal</b> (3750 ft.; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>; fee). A little
to the N.E., on the so-called <i>Balcão</i>, we enjoy an excellent survey of
the *<i>Waterfall of the Risco</i>, which plunges from a rock, 330 ft. high, into
a ravine overgrown with climbing plants and ferns, and a little lower
down provides the water for the old conduit. Crossing the viaduct of
the latter, we skirt the new conduit, and in a few minutes reach another
luxuriantly overgrown ravine, that of the *<i>Vinte e Cinco Fontes</i>, where
no fewer than twenty-five waterfalls issue from a narrow basin.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Rabaçal we may ascend towards the E. (with a guide) to the
(2 hrs.) plateau of <i>Paul da Serra</i> (4656 ft.; ‘mountain swamp’), where
fogs often prevail, and the two <i>Tanquinhos Houses</i> (about 4900 ft.; used
by the engineers; poor quarters). Near them rise the <i>Pico dos Tanquinhos</i>
(5260 ft.) and the *<i>Pico Ruivo do Paul</i> (5388 ft.), both of which afford
grand views of the mountains.</p>

<p class='c016'>Scarcely less repaying is the two days’ <span class='sc'>Excursion to Santa Anna</span>
on the N. coast, to which a third day may be added for the ascent of the
Pico Ruivo or the Pico Areeiro. We start from the Campo da Barca at
Funchal (Pl. D, 1) and follow the Estrada do Conde Carvalhal (Pl. E, 1),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>which ascends to the N.E. in windings to (3¾ M.) <i>Palheiro do Ferreiro</i>
(1857 ft.; bullock-car from Funchal 1200 rs.), the finest quinta in the
island, the property of Mr. John Blandy of Funchal (adm. on application).
Farther on we follow the road, uphill and downhill, to (6 M.)
Camacha (2369 ft.; no inn; bullock-car 2500 rs.), a well-to-do village of
basket-makers in a charming wooded region, with many villas owned by
English residents in Funchal. Beyond the <i>Pico dos Iroses</i> (p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>) the
road, now less attractive, crosses the gorges of the <i>Ribeira de Porto
Novo</i> and <i>Ribeira de Santa Cruz</i>, and then, turning to the N., reaches
(13 M.) <i>Santo Antonio da Serra</i> (2320 ft.), a poor village on a grassy
tableland. We descend thence to the N.W. into a sequestered valley
carpeted with flowers (Amaryllis Belladonna, etc.), where a rough path
leads to the (15½ M.) <i>Portella Pass</i> (2021 ft.), which commands a superb
*View of the mountains at the head of the Metade Valley (see below),
of the N.E. coast from the Penha d’Aguia (see below) to the Ponta de
São Lourenço (p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>), and of the island of Porto Santo (p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>). We now
descend, at first by a zigzag path, through vineyards and sugar-cane plantations,
to (18 M.) <i>Porto da Cruz</i> (no inn), a picturesque little seaport
at the S.E. base of the abrupt *<i>Penha d’Aguia</i> (1949 ft.; ‘eagle-rock’),
the most curiously shaped hill in the island. We next ascend the saddle
to the S. of the Penha d’Aguia, noteworthy for its marvellously rich vegetation,
and descend the ravine of the <i>Ribeiro Frio</i> (see below) to <i>Fayal</i>,
a village not far from the charming <i>Pescaria</i>, a little bay to the N.W.
of the Penha d’Aguia. The church-terrace here affords a grand survey of
the valleys of the Ribeiro Frio, the Ribeiro da Metade, and the Ribeiro
Secco (all mentioned below). From Fayal we then cross the <i>Cortadas Pass</i>,
or <i>Bocca do Cortado</i> (1985 ft.), to (24 M.) Santa Anna (1408 ft.; Hot. Figueira,
very fair; pop. 3200), a village well adapted for some stay, the
capital of the <i>Comarca de Santa Anna</i>, the most fertile region in the island
(sugar-cane, sweet potatoes, yams, etc.). From Santa Anna a rough mule-track,
very indistinct at places, ascends past the curious basaltic <i>Homem
em Pé</i> (‘man on foot’), and lastly over the saddle by the <i>Encumeada Alta</i>
(5948 ft.), to the top of the <i>Pico Ruivo</i> (6060 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>), which commands
a most imposing, but seldom very clear panorama of the central chain,
part of the Gran Curral (p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>), and the E. half of the island.</p>

<p class='c022'>Turning back from Santa Anna, we first wend our way towards the
S. to the <i>Cova da Roda</i>, where we again overlook the N.E. coast as far
as the Portella Pass and the Porto da Cruz; we then cross the <i>Ribeiro
Secco</i> and the (29½ M.) <i>Cruzinhas Ridge</i>, and descend into the valley of
the *<i>Ribeiro da Metade</i>, a gorge vying in grandeur with the Gran Curral.
A zigzag path (‘Quatorze Voltas’) ascends thence to the little venda (inn)
of <i>Cedro Gordo</i>, and then crosses the <i>Serra de Caramuja</i> into the (33 M.)
valley of the <i>Ribeiro Frio</i>, with its splendid groves of tilwood trees (see
p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>), laurel, and erica. Above the village of that name rises the <i>Balcão</i>,
a rock of basalt (near the not easily accessible <i>Levada do Furado</i>),
where we have a grand *View of the Metade Valley with mountain-background.
Our route winds up the rocks of the Feiteiras (‘ferns’) and the
<i>Pouso Saddle</i>, with its fine views, to the (34½ M.) <i>Pouso</i> or <i>Poïzo Refuge</i>
(4603 ft.), situated on a dreary plateau. From the Pouso Refuge we may
without difficulty climb the <i>Pico Areeiro</i> (5893 ft.; 1¼–1½ hr.), a famous
point of view, but almost always capped with clouds. The bridle-path
ascends past the <i>Observatorio</i>; we may then descend direct to the Vista
dos Navios.</p>

<p class='c022'>The next part of our route, from the Pouso Refuge to the Monte
(p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>), is uninteresting. From the <i>Vista dos Navios</i> (‘view of ships’),
whence the bay of Funchal is visible, the track descends to the head of
the valley of the <i>Ribeira de João Gomes</i> (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>), rounds the E. slope
of the <i>Pico do Arrebentão</i> (3842 ft.), to which point a running sledge
(p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>) may be ordered from Funchal, and then descends rapidly, partly
in windings, to the (39 M.) <i>Monte</i>. Thence to (41½ M.) <i>Funchal</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>.</p>

(see p. <a href='#Page_425'>425</a>).—It should be noted that almost all the British lines have
recently raised their fares by ten per cent in consequence, it is said, of a
rise in the price of coal. Inquiry as to this ‘surtax’ should therefore be
made in every case.—The direct steamers perform the voyage (1707 M.
from Southampton to Teneriffe) in 5–6 days; the coasting steamers (viâ
Oporto, Lisbon, etc.; about 2250 M.) take much longer.</p>

<p class='c022'>In addition to the above-mentioned steamers communication among
the islands themselves is effected by the small cargo-boats of the <i>Compañía
de Vapores Correos Interinsulares Canarios</i> which ply 9 times
monthly between Teneriffe and Las Palmas in 6 hrs. (fare 20 or 15 pesetas);
and by those of the <i>Servicio de Pailebotes</i> which ply weekly from Teneriffe
to Las Palmas, and weekly to Santa Cruz de la Palma. Inquiry as
to the sailings, which often vary, should be made on the spot. The
Spanish cuisine on board these local boats is not very inviting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Canary Islands (<i>Islas Canarias</i> or <i>Afortunadas</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
‘fortunate islands’), the <i>Makáron Nésoi</i> or <i>Insulae Fortunatae</i>
of antiquity, in 27° 30′ to 29° 26′ N. lat., and 13° 15′ to 18° 2′ W.
long., lie off the coast of Mauretania, the nearest point being Cape
Juby (p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>). There are in all thirteen islands, forming a Spanish
province of a total area of 3305 sq. M., with a population of 364,000.
They consist of two groups. The E. group is composed of <i>Lanzarote</i>
(rising to 2231 ft. above the sea), <i>Fuerteventura</i> (2789 ft.), and
five smaller islands (<i>Alegranza</i>, <i>Graciosa</i>, etc.); to the W. group
belong <i>Gran Canaria</i> (6400 ft.), <i>Teneriffe</i> (12,175 ft.; once the
meridian used by the Spaniards and the Dutch), <i>Gomera</i> (4366 ft.),
<i>Palma</i> (7737 ft.), and <i>Hierro</i> or <i>Ferro</i> (4643 ft.), the meridian
used by France since the time of Louis XIII. (1634). Teneriffe,
Gran Canaria, and sometimes Palma are the islands usually visited
by tourists; the others chiefly attract botanists and geologists.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The Canaries, supposed by some geographers to form part of
the submerged continent of <i>Atlantis</i>, and by others to have been
outlying spurs of the Atlas of Morocco (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>), have the same geological
formation as Madeira (see pp. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, 18, 19). ‘In Fuerteventura
especially there occur masses of slag and lava, thrown up by countless
eruptions, superimposed on the diabase formation, which is
still visible in many places; and in Teneriffe we find phonolithic
and trachytic rocks as well as the basaltic. Grand old craters (<i>calderas</i>)
exist in Ferro, Gran Canaria, and most of all in Palma and
Teneriffe. The enormous basin of the <i>Cañadas</i> in Teneriffe has
been almost entirely filled up with later streams of lava and scoriæ,
which have formed a distinct volcanic cone, the great <i>Pico de
Teide</i>, 12,175 ft. in height.’ The last considerable eruptions were
those of 1677 in Palma, of 1730–36 and 1824 in Lanzarote, and
of 1705, 1706, 1796, and 1798 on the N.W. coast of Teneriffe, all
of which caused great havoc. On the occasion of the eruption of
1909 in Teneriffe a large lava-stream, accompanied by the emission
of vapour and stones from the central crater (see p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>), burst
forth near the foot of the Chahorra (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>) and advanced in a N.W.
direction towards Santiago and El Tanque but came to rest before
reaching these villages. There was little damage and no loss of
human life. In the W. islands, which like Madeira rise very abruptly
from the sea, the effects of erosion in the broad valleys, with their
rich soil, as well as in the deep ravines (<i>barrancos</i>) of more recent
origin, are specially noticeable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The climate of the Canaries is remarkable for the striking
contrasts prevailing between the E. and the W. groups on the one
hand, and between the lower and the higher levels on the other.
In the almost treeless islands of <i>Lanzarote</i> and <i>Fuerteventura</i>
(62 M. to the N.W. of Cape Juby) years sometimes elapse without
rainfall, while the dreaded <i>tiempo del sur</i>, the hot and extremely
dry wind from the Sahara, covers them with dust and sand and
often brings swarms of locusts. Even more disastrous for agriculture
are the sandy dunes or coast-hills, thrown up by the currents
off the African shores, the sand of which is driven inland by violent
N. winds. The <i>Gran Canaria</i>, on the other hand, though by
no means free from the locust pest, holds an intermediate position
in point of climate and scenery between the more continental E.
group of islands and the almost wholly oceanic W. group. Owing
to the influence of the gulf-stream (p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>) and the zone of high air-pressure
prevalent in the W. Canaries in winter, the N. coast of
<i>Teneriffe</i> and the islands of <i>Gomera</i> and <i>Palma</i> enjoy a remarkably
mild and equable winter climate (the mean temperature of
winter at Puerto Orotava being 60° Fahr. and the minimum 51°).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>In the region tempered by the trade-wind clouds, which gather at
a height varying from 2300 to 5000 ft. above the sea, even the
summer temperature is quite bearable; but on the high mountains,
above the cloud-zone, the air is extremely dry, and the burning
heat of the day is suddenly followed, as in the tropics, by a severe
chill. The rainfall at Santa Cruz de Tenerife averages 12 inches,
at Santa Cruz de la Palma 14 in., at Puerto Orotava 17 in., at
Laguna 22 inches. The lowest snow-line is about 3300 ft.</p>

<p class='c011'>The vegetation of the W. islands, the Eldorado of botanists,
surpasses that of Madeira in variety, though not in luxuriance;
but it is confined to the forest-zone in the region of the trade-wind
clouds, and to the low ground irrigated with the aid of these clouds,
where the soil consists of disintegrated diabase, tufa, and lava. On
the other hand large tracts of land, especially in the Gran Canaria
and on the S. and E. coasts of Teneriffe, are entirely destitute of
vegetation, even in winter, while in summer the verdure of the
cultivated land is often covered with a mantle of grey dust.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Canary Islands, together with Madeira and the Azores, have
been described as a region ‘where the tertiary flora, destroyed in
Europe during the glacier epoch, has survived and developed, at
least since the pliocene age, in insular solitude’. To the primæval
African flora, the same as that of the original ‘diabasic Canaries’,
belong in particular the stately Canary pine (Pinus canariensis),
several species of laurel, such as the Laurus canariensis, the <i>viñatigo</i>
(Persea indica), the aloe, the oleander-leaved Kleinia neriifolia, the
cactus-like euphorbias, the <i>balo</i> (Plocama pendula), and the famous
dragon-tree (Dracæna Draco). Besides the endemic trees and plants
are others of very early origin, the seeds of which were originally
brought over from India or America by the gulf-stream. During
the Spanish period countless other plants, now cosmopolitan, were
imported from America, fruit-trees from Europe, and shrubs from
the Mediterranean, which last, favoured by the climate, develop
into bushy trees. In the gardens, which are mostly enclosed by high
walls, we are struck with the gorgeous wealth of bougainvilleas,
gloxinias, poinsettias, bignonias, daturas, walbergias, passifloras,
and many other flowers. In the lower and more tropical districts
grow, side by side, bananas (<i>plátanos</i>), tomatoes, sugar-cane (<i>caña
de azúcar</i>), yams (Span. <i>ñame</i>), tobacco, oranges and lemons, prickly-pear
(Opuntia Tuna), coffee-plants, Peruvian pepper-trees (<i>pimenteros</i>),
E. Indian bread-fruit, mango and camphor trees, eucalypti,
cork-trees, tamarisks (<i>tarajales</i>), araucarias, magnolias, fig-trees,
Japanese medlars, palms (about 25 varieties), notably the superb
Canary palm (Phœnix canariensis or Jubæ Webb), the date-palm
(p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>), the royal palm (Oreodoxa regia), and, in Palma, the
cocoa-nut palm. The vineyards, yielding the famous <i>Malmsey</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>) and <i>Vidueño</i> wines, rise on the S. side of Teneriffe from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the lower land to a height of 4070 ft. above the sea-level. In the
upper cultivated regions the chief crops and fruits are wheat,
potatoes, lupins, maize, chestnuts, walnuts, and, among other
European fruits, peaches. On the rocky sides of the barrancos
occur everywhere the aloe, the cactus-like Euphorbia canariensis
(Span. <i>cardón</i>), the tabayba (Euphorbia Regis Jubæ), the orchilla
lichen (Roccella tinctoria; woad), and Sempervivum (house-leek;
some 60 varieties). At the bottom of the barrancos and in the
cloud-region we encounter beautiful underwood, composed of
evergreen myrtles and laurels, the strawberry-tree (Arbutus canariensis),
ericas, stemless ferns, and a few climbing plants. Above
the level of the trade-wind clouds we may still meet with the cistus,
the Canary pine (up to 7050 ft. above the sea), the white Cytisus
proliferus (Span. <i>escobón</i>), and the Adenocarpus frankenoides (Span.
<i>codeso</i>), a kind of gorse. The Alpine retama (Spartocytisus supranubius;
Span. <i>retama blanca</i>), a kind of broom, the commonest
plant in the Cañadas, grows on the Peak up to a height of 10,300 ft.;
but a few mosses and lichens alone reach the summit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fauna of the Canaries is remarkably poor. The characteristic
bird is the canary (Serinus canariensis), which, as in Madeira, is
of a greenish-grey colour, while the yellow canaries are imported.
Mosquitoes, especially on the E. and S. coasts of the islands,
fleas, and flies, including some whose bite is very unpleasant,
abound in summer. The more important fish are cod, tunny, and
sardines. Chief among domestic animals is the goat. Camels were
introduced from the continent in 1405.</p>

<p class='c011'>The islands, which were probably known to the Carthaginians
and Greeks, were for a time occupied by king Juba II. (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>)
with a view to the manufacture of purple dye from the juice of the
Orchilla (see above). At that period the population consisted chiefly
of the so-called <i>Guanches</i> (from <i>guan</i>, son, and <i>Chenerfe</i>, Teneriffe),
whose culture down to the middle ages was still that of the
flint age, while their inscriptions are Libyan in character. In
1402–96 the islands were conquered, first by the Normans, under
Jean de Betancourt, at the instance of the kings of Castile, and
later by the Spaniards, with the result that the Guanches, in spite
of their heroic resistance, were largely exterminated or sold into
slavery. A few survivors still lingered in their cave-dwellings, as
at Atalaya (p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>) and Artenara (p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>), but others intermarried
with Moorish immigrants (1405), and, in the Spanish period, with
Norman, S. Spanish, and Irish settlers. Their language has been
extinct since the 17th century. A few peculiarities of the present
population, which somewhat resembles that of S. Spain and of the
W. Indies, survive in the costume of the peasants, consisting of a
white blanket (<i>matta</i>) wrapped round the body like a shepherd’s
cloak, in their quaint old pottery, in the whistling language of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Gomera, and in the national <i>gofio</i>, a kind of porridge of maize and
wheat. The Grand Canary contains also several villages of negroes,
descendants of the slaves on the sugar-plantations. Among the
foreigners there are 2100 English, 600 French, and 600 Germans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Puerto de la Luz near Las Palmas,
the chief ports of the Canaries, as also Puerto Orotava (p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>), Santa
Cruz de la Palma, and others, all declared free harbours in 1852, are
rising places and compete with Madeira in provisioning the ocean
steamers. The trade is in British, Spanish, and German hands.
The chief exports are bananas, tomatoes, early potatoes and other
vegetables, and wine. The only industry of any importance is the
embroidery and lace-making of Teneriffe (‘calado’ embroidery after
Mexican patterns, rosette-work introduced from Paraguay, the rich
Vilaflor lace, and embroidery in relief from Venetian and Irish
models). The cochineal insect (living on the prickly-pear plant)
was introduced from Honduras in 1826, and for many years its
culture yielded large profits to the islanders, but the discovery of
aniline dyes has well-nigh ruined this industry.</p>

<p class='c016'>The best <span class='sc'>Season</span> for a tour in the Canaries is from the beginning
of March to the end of May. The best winter-quarters for invalids are
to be found at Puerto Orotava or the more remote Güimar in Teneriffe,
and at the Monte in the Grand Canary. Good quarters are obtainable also
at Santa Cruz and Laguna in Teneriffe, and at Las Palmas in the Grand
Canary, where most of the best hotels are in the English style, and
English money circulates freely. The Spanish ‘fondas’, where the national
currency is in vogue, fall short of modern requirements, while the country
inns are mostly wretched taverns.</p>

<p class='c022'>The chief public conveyances in the islands are, in Teneriffe, the
electric tramway from Santa Cruz to Tacoronte, and in the Grand Canary
the harbour tramway at Las Palmas; the only others are the dirty and
often crowded <i>coches públicos</i>, the very expensive four-seated vehicles,
and the <i>tartanas</i> or gigs. For mountain excursions horses or mules are
used, the <i>arriero</i> or attendant serving as a guide.</p>

<p class='c022'>Among numerous <span class='sc'>Books</span> on the Canary Islands are <i>Samler Brown’s</i>
guide (see p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>); <i>Whitford’s</i> The Canary Islands as a Winter Resort
(London, 1890; 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>); <i>Ward’s</i> Vale of Orotava (London, 1903); <i>C. Piazzi
Smyth’s</i> Teneriffe, an Astronomer’s Experiment (London, 1858); and <i>Olivia
Stone’s</i> Tenerife and its Six Satellites (London, 1889).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Teneriffe</b>, Span. <i>Tenerife</i>, the largest and most populous of
the islands, 51½ M. long, 31 M. in breadth, and 781 sq. M. in
area, contains about 140,000 inhab., mostly living on the N. coast.
The island is composed of three mountain-ranges, chiefly of eruptive
rock of a basaltic character, which have been welded together,
probably since the miocene period, by great phonolithic and
trachytic eruptions. These are the <i>Anaga Mts.</i> on the N.E., the
<i>Teno Mts.</i> on the N.W., and the <i>Adeje Mts.</i> in the Bandas del Sur.
Beyond the lofty plain of Laguna the Anaga range is prolonged to
the Llano de la Maja by the massive <i>Cumbre</i>. In the centre of
the island, from the enormous crater-ring of Las Cañadas, and high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>above the trade-wind clouds, towers the mighty <i>Peak of Teneriffe</i>,
or <i>Pico de Teide</i> (12,175 ft.), visible for 100 M. around.</p>

<p class='c011'>Approaching the island from the N., we first sight the sombre
and wildly fissured <i>Anaga Mts.</i> (3406 ft.). We steer past the lighthouse
(Faro; 811 ft.) a little to the N.W. of the <i>Punta del Drago</i>,
whose light is visible for 40 M., then skirt the rocky E. coast, with
the <i>Punta de Anaga</i> and <i>Punta Antequera</i>, and at length cast
anchor in the open roads of the bay of <i>Santa Cruz</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Santa Cruz de Tenerife</i>, a fortified seaport with 30,300 inhab.,
and the capital of the island since 1821 when it superseded
Laguna, lies picturesquely in 28° 28′ N. lat. and 16° 15′ W. long.,
on a bay 3 M. broad between the <i>Valle del Bufadero</i> (p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>) and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the <i>Barranco de Santos</i>, below the spurs of the Anaga Mts. and
the plateau of Laguna. Its beautiful <i>patios</i>, or courtyards, recall
those of Seville and the flat roofs with their <i>miradores</i>, or belvederes,
are reminiscent of Cadiz. The harbour is entered by 3500–4000
vessels per annum. At <i>Regla</i>, to the S. of the town, is a
wireless telegraph station.</p>

<p class='c016'>The town was heroically defended in 1797 against the British fleet
under Nelson, who lost his arm here and had to retire after heavy loss.
Near the old <i>Citadel</i> (now Cuartel Almeida; Pl. C, 1) stands the saluting battery.
The old <i>Castillo de San Cristóbal</i> (Pl. C, 2, 3) now contains
public offices.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Alameda de la Marina (Pl. C, 2), near the landing-place,
we soon reach the <span class='sc'>Plaza de la Constitución</span> (Pl. B, C, 3)
to the S.W., with the <i>Governor’s Palace</i> (Gobierno Civil; Pl. 5,
B 2; fine patio), the club-houses, and the cafés (p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>). On the
side next the sea rises the <i>Triunfo de la Candelaria</i>, a column
in honour of the Virgin, the tutelary saint of the Canaries (p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>),
erected by the Spaniards as a memorial of their victories, with four
Guanche kings as worshippers.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the S. side of the Plaza de la Constitución the Calle de
la Cruz Verde leads to the <span class='sc'>Iglesia de la Concepción</span> (Pl. B, 3),
the principal church in the town, consisting of a nave with double
aisles, and situated close to the Barranco de Santos. It was founded
early in the 16th cent., but was rebuilt after a fire in 1652. The
tower, 181 ft. high, affords an extensive panorama.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Interior.</span> The central chapel of the aisle on the left contains two
flags captured from Nelson’s fleet (see above), of which the town is very
proud. Here too, by the high-altar, is a stone cross originally erected outside
by Al. Fernandez de Lugo (p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>) in 1494 as a memorial of his victories.
The pulpit, in Italian marble, is by <i>Matias Rodriguez</i> (18th cent.). The
burial chapel of the artist (entered to the right of the high-altar) contains
several pretty, but unfinished carvings in juniper-wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Near this is the <i>Mercado</i> (Pl. B, 3), a covered market for fruit
and other commodities (worth visiting in the early morning).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the N.W. angle of the Plaza de la Constitución the Calle
San Francisco leads, a few yards farther on, to the church of <i>San
Francisco</i> (Pl. 6, B, 2), built in 1680. The tower, inlaid with
<i>azulejos</i>, or ornamental tiles, dates from 1777.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old Franciscan monastery contains at present the <i>Museum</i>
with fine art and anthropological collections (new building being
erected near the Ayuntamiento, Pl. 1, B 2). Beyond it lies the Plaza
del Príncipe Alfonso (Pl. B, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The long <span class='sc'>Calle de Alfonso Treceno</span> (Pl. B, A, 2), or Calle de
Castillo, the main street, connects the Plaza de la Constitución with
the pretty Plaza de Weyler (Pl. A, 2). The <i>Paseo de los Coches</i> and
the <i>Paseo de Ronda</i> (Pl. A, B, 2, 1), a charming promenade bordered
with pepper-trees, oleanders, and geraniums, lead thence to the N.
through the villa quarter (Barrio de Ensanche).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><span class='sc'>Excursions on the E. Coast</span> (cabs, see p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>). From the Paseo de
Ronda we may go past the Pino de Oro Hotel (p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>), or by the Hotel
Quisisana, to the <i>Conduit</i> (llevada), skirt this and the right bank of the
<i>Barranco de Almeida</i>, and thus reach the (1 hr.) tunnels, or we may
continue our walk to the (3 hrs.) <i>Aguere Springs</i>.—Starting from the
harbour the fine coast-road leads to the N.E. to the mouth of the <i>Valle
del Bufadero</i>, which lies at the foot of the Anaga Mts. and is defended
by a fort; from here we may go on, crossing some barrancos and skirting
the rocks, to the dirty fishing-village of (5 M.) <i>San Andrés</i> (poor inn). Thence
to the <i>Cruz de Taganana</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>.—Drive from <i>Cuesta</i> (see below) by
the Carretera del Sur, a road shaded by tamarisks, to the S.W., along the
slope of the bare sunburnt <i>Cumbre</i> (p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>), up and down hill, through many
barrancos, viâ (8 M.) <i>San Isidro</i> to (10½ M.) the so-called <i>Halfway House</i>
(tavern; good wine); then through the deep <i>Barranco Hondo</i>, below the
village of that name (1310 ft.), mostly through pine-woods (<i>pinal</i>). To
our right, on the hill, lies the village of <i>Igueste</i>; to our left, on the
<i>Ladera de Candelaria</i>, is the village of <i>Candelaria</i>, with the famous
pilgrimage-church of the Virgen de la Candelaria. Lastly we cross a
lava-stream from the <i>Garganta de Güimar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>) to (20 M.) <b>Güimar</b>
(975 ft.; Hot. El Buen Retiro, with a fine garden, pens. 8–10<i>s.</i>, English,
good; Pens. Sunnyside, pens. 7<i>s.</i>), a village of 2000 inhab. in a sunny
and sheltered site, in the <i>Valle de Güimar</i>. This fertile valley, 3¾ M.
in breadth, bounded on the S. by the <i>Ladera de Güimar</i>, and on the W.
by the ash-cone of the <i>Arafo</i> and the <i>Monte de Izaña</i> (7380 ft.), yields
sugar-cane, oranges, and bananas. Luxuriant vegetation, including gigantic
arbutus-trees, is seen also in the <i>Barranco del Rio</i>, to the W., above
the village. From the S. end of the village we may reach (ca. 1½ hr.)
two cave-dwellings of Guanches (p. <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>), now empty, in the upland valley
of the <i>Barranco de Badajoz</i>. Route over the <i>Pedro Gil Pass</i> to <i>Orotava</i>,
see p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>; ascent of the <i>Peak of Teneriffe</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to the Orotava Valley</span>, the most charming
spot in the island, takes 1-1½ days. We go by tramway (p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>) to
Tacoronte and drive thence to Puerto Orotava (see p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The shadeless and generally very dusty Carretera del Norte, the
continuation of the Calle de Alfonso Treceno (p. <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>) and Rambla
de Pulido, crosses the Barranco de Santos and ascends the N.W.
slope of the <i>Plateau of Laguna</i> in windings affording several
fine views. The country is parched and scorched in spite of the
numerous reservoirs (<i>estanques</i>), but corn-fields, tamarisks, fruit-trees,
and relics of prickly-pear plantations are occasionally seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>3 M. <i>Cuesta</i> (962 ft.; inn). The road to Güimar (see above)
diverges here. Farther on, as we approach the cooler and better
watered tableland, the vegetation becomes richer.</p>

<p class='c016'>6¼ M. <b>Laguna.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotel.</span> <i>Hot. Aguere &#38; Continental</i>, Carrera 57,
pens. 10–12<i>s.</i>, good.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Laguna</i> or <i>La Laguna</i> (1740 ft.), once the capital of the
Canaries (see p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>), now a quiet little country-town (pop. 4900), is
a favourite summer residence of the wealthier families of Santa
Cruz. The old-fashioned houses, as at Villa Orotava, often have
pretty, carved balconies; their unglazed windows, closed with shutters
only, generally have a <i>postígo</i>, or flap, from which the inmates
can view the street.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The <i>Cathedral</i>, founded in 1513 and since 1908 in course of
reconstruction, contains the tomb of Alonso Fernandez de Lugo, the
conqueror of Teneriffe (1493–6). From the Calle Juan de Vera,
diverging to the N., we follow the first side-street, the Calle de
San Agustín, to the left, to the old Augustinian monastery, once the
university, and now the <i>Instituto de Canarias</i>, which contains
the <i>Biblioteca Pública</i> (26,000 vols.) and a small natural history
collection. To the right, in the same street (No. 28), is the <i>Palacio
Episcopal</i>, whose patio is richly adorned with flowers.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the E. end of the street a few paces bring us to the Plaza
de Adelantado, No. 1 in which is the old Palace of the <i>Nava</i> family.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the S. side of the Plaza the Calle de Santo Domingo leads
to the <i>Priests’ Seminary</i> (Seminario Conciliar), once a Dominican
monastery. In the side-street opposite No. 30 the second door on
the left leads into the garden of a <i>Farm Building</i> (finca) which
contains a venerable dragon-tree (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>; fee).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Iglesia de la Concepción</i>, at the W. end of the town, contains
a fine carved pulpit.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> A fine drive (12–15 p.) may be taken viâ (4½ M.) <i>Tegueste</i>
and (5½ M.) <i>Tejina</i>, not far from the gloomy <i>Barranco de las Palmas</i>,
to (10½ M.) the fishing-village of <i>Bajamar</i>, near the <i>Punta del Hidalgo</i>,
a headland which affords a splendid survey of the precipitous N. coast of
the island.—We may also hire a mule (6 p.) to take us to the laurel forests
of <i>Las Mercedes</i> or <i>La Mina</i>. From Las Mercedes we may ascend past
the <i>Cruz el Carmen</i> (about 2950 ft.) with its rich thicket of bushes (Erica
scoparia), and past the <i>Cruz de Afur</i> (3405 ft.) to the (3½ hrs.) *<i>Cruz de
Taganana</i> (3068 ft.), a splendid point for surveying the great Peak and
the E. coast as far as Santa Cruz. We may then descend to the N., through
a magnificent old *Forest of Canary laurel, viñatigo (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>), tree-heath
(Erica arborea), and Pleiomeris, to the village of <i>Taganana</i> (689 ft.), near
which the tall pinnacles of the <i>Hombres de Taganana</i> tower above the
abrupt rocky coast. Or we may go on to the N.E. to the <i>Cruz del Draguillo</i>
(2205 ft.) and descend thence to <i>Igueste</i> and <i>San Andrés</i> (p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>) on the E.
coast.—Another excursion from Laguna is to the (2 hrs.) ancient <i>Forest
of Agua García</i> (p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>) to the W.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Laguna the <span class='sc'>High Road</span>, bordered at first with eucalypti,
now crosses the plateau of the <i>Rodeos</i> to the Laguna Saddle
(2008 ft.; watershed), and descends thence, affording fine *Views of
the <i>Cumbre</i> (p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>), the Peak itself, and its spurs, and passing the
hills of <i>Guamaza</i> famed for their view of Tacoronte, to the <i>Bandas
del Norte</i>, the far cooler and greener N. coast of the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>12 M. <b>Tacoronte</b> (1762 ft.; Camacho’s Tacoronte Hotel, on
the road above the town, pens. from 9<i>s.</i>, good; pop. 4200), beautifully
situated, is well adapted for a longer stay. Near it is produced
the best wine in the island, and its orange-groves are famous.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Tacoronte to <i>Puerto Orotava</i> a motor-omnibus of the Grand

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> The road to the N.E. leads past the slopes of the <i>Montaña
del Picón</i>, and through the <i>Valle de Guerra</i>, to (7 M.) <i>Tejina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>).—To
the N. we may descend (1½ hr.) the precipitous rocks on the <i>Coast</i>
(650–980 ft.), where the numerous caves are said to have once been inhabited
by the Guanches (p. <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>).—To the S.E. lies the (1½ hr.) primæval
*<i>Forest of Agua García</i> (2588 ft.), the finest in Teneriffe, with its huge
erica trees overgrown with creepers, its venerable laurels, and superb tree-ferns.
Specially charming is a sequestered nook at the <i>Madre d’Agua</i>,
the source of the water-conduit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Puerto Orotava road (conveyance, see p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>), whence the
route to <i>Sauzal</i> diverges to the right a little farther on, passes
through wheat-fields, vineyards, and orchards, and is bordered with
tamarisks, Canary palms, oleanders, aloes, and hedges of geranium.
The steep slopes of the Cumbre are carefully cultivated in terraces
up to the evergreen zone of the cloud-region. Fine view of the
rock-bound coast and the blue ocean to the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>15 M. <i>Matanza</i> (1585 ft.; ‘slaughter’), the scene of the last defeat
of the Spanish invaders (1494), is now a village of 2000 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond (17 M.) the little town of <i>Victoria</i> (1240 ft.), where
the Guanches sustained a decisive defeat in 1494, the road forks.
The new road, to the left, crosses the <i>Barranco Hondo</i>, a ravine
about 330 ft. deep, by a viaduct (1909); the old road winds down
into the Barranco Hondo. The two roads unite at the church of
(20 M.) <i>Santa Ursula</i>, a palm-girt village (886 ft.; 2200 inhab.),
on the crest of the <i>Ladera de Santa Ursula</i>, noted for its wine.
About 1 hr. above it is the farm of La Florida (p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the village we obtain a glimpse, and then, at the
<i>Humboldt Corner</i>, a full and glorious view of the **<b>Orotava
Valley</b>, the <i>Taoro Valley</i> of the Guanches, famed at once for its
harmonious outlines, for its superb colouring, and for its luxuriant
vegetation. The valley, about 7 M. long by 6 M. wide, probably
formed by subsidence, and descending rather rapidly to the sea in
terraces, is sprinkled with smiling villages and countless white
country-houses, embosomed among palms, pines, orange-trees, rosebushes,
and climbing plants, which are abundantly watered by
cuttings and conduits descending from the cloud-region. The
tropical character of the landscape is enhanced by the extensive
plantations of bananas. On the E. and W. the valley is flanked
by the lava slopes, about 1000 ft. in height, of the Ladera de
Santa Ursula and the <i>Ladera de Tigaiga</i>, and on the S. it is
bounded by the Cumbre, with the ‘organ-pipes’ at the S.E. angle
(p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>). Far above its steep banks, but most often concealed by
the trade-wind clouds, towers the majestic pyramid of the Peak.
In the middle of the valley rise three eruptive cones of recent
origin, the <i>Montaña de la Horca</i> (833 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>), the <i>Montaña
de Chaves</i> (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>), and the <i>Montaña de las Gañanias</i>, which have
sent forth lava-streams descending to the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Beyond the <i>Barranco del Pinito</i> the direct road to (24½ M.)
<i>Villa Orotava</i> (p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>) branches off to the left, and 1 M. farther
on another road from that town joins ours. We are next carried
through deep barrancos by means of cuttings, with their surprising
variety of layers of slag and beds of lava, and at the Montaña de
la Horca we come to a point where a new road diverges, to the
left, for Realejo Bajo (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>) and Icod de los Vinos (p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>). We
descend to the right to Puerto Orotava, passing a private entrance
to the Grand Hotel on our right.</p>

<p class='c016'>27½ M. <b>Puerto Orotava.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotels</span> (often crowded in March

<p class='c009'><i>Puerto Orotava</i>, officially called <i>Puerto de la Cruz</i>, the most
popular invalid resort in the Canaries, a poor little seaport with
3100 inhab., lies on a delta formed by lava-streams. The Calle
San Juan, the main street, in continuation of the highroad, descends,
passing near the Plaza de la Constitución, with its garden-grounds,
to the <i>Pier</i> (Muelle), whence the produce of the Orotava
Valley is conveyed by small boats to the vessels in the roads.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Plaza de la Iglesia, to the E. of the Plaza de la Constitución,
are the <i>Iglesia de la Peña de Santa Francisca</i>, with
its new tower, and the <i>Casas Consistoriales</i> or town-hall, with its
old-fashioned wooden balcony.—Mr. R. Gomez, the chemist (see
above), possesses a small <i>Guanche Museum</i> (adm. 1 p.).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of the town a palm-avenue leads along the <i>Barranco
de Martianez</i> to the bathing beach (Playa de Martianez). Beyond
the ravine, about halfway up the abrupt coast-hill, is the spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>called <i>Fuente de Martianez</i>.—A zigzag path ascends to the <i>Sitio
de la Paz</i> (492 ft.), once occupied by Alex. von Humboldt (1814),
and now containing several memorials of that savant. A cypress-avenue
is the sole relic of the old garden (fee).—A beautiful walk
may be taken to the <i>Barranco de las Arenas</i>, 1½ hr. to the E.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. the Camino del Puerto (see below) leads past the
<i>Observatorio</i> (belonging to the nautical observatory of Hamburg)
to the *<i>Botanic Garden</i> (Jardín Botánico or de Aclimatación),
laid out in 1788, which, though sadly neglected, contains exquisite
flowers, superb magnolias, and fine specimens of royal, Canary, and
exotic palms, dragon-trees (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>), and fig-trees (Ficus imperialis
and Ficus nitida; p. <a href='#Page_233'>233</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>A dusty road (donkey 3 p.) leads from the cemetery at the W.
end of the town to the <i>Finca los Frailes</i> of Dr. Perez, with its
splendid avenue of palms. The road ends at the <i>Risco do Burgado</i>,
with its fissured lava cliffs, washed by huge breakers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Pleasant ride (4–5 hrs.; donkey 4, horse 8 p.) by Los Frailes to <i>Realejo
Bajo</i> and <i>Realejo Alto</i> (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>), returning, above the three eruptive cones
(p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>), viâ <i>Cruz Santa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>), <i>Perdoma</i>, and <i>Villa Orotava</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Puerto Orotava the dusty roads mentioned on p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>, besides
the Camino del Puerto, the old bridle-path, lead through a
garden-like region in 1¼–1½ hr. to <b>Villa Orotava</b> (1080–1480 ft.;
Hot. Suizo, pens. 6–8 p., good; Hot. Victoria, same charges; 3600
inhab.) the <i>Arautápala</i> of the Guanches, now the capital of the
Orotava Valley. The antiquated little town, which has fallen into
great poverty since the decline of the cochineal culture (p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>),
occupies almost the loveliest site in the whole island.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the E. entrance is the Plaza de San Agustín, with the old
<i>Iglesia de San Agustín</i> and a band-stand, whence we have a fine
view of Puerto Orotava and the sea. Near it is the <i>Villa of
Marquesa Quinta</i>, now owned by Dr. Perez (p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>), with its beautiful
park; on the highest terrace is a marble mausoleum (adm. to
both 1 p.).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the quarter above the <i>Iglesia de la Concepción</i> are several
châteaux of the noblesse. On the S.W. side of the town, near the
monastery of <i>San Francisco</i> (now a hospital), are two old mansions
with very handsome carved balconies (comp. p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>An excursion, attractive in clear weather only, may be made to the
farm of <b>Aqua Mansa</b> (3491 ft.), in the S.E. angle of the Orotava Valley,
within the cloud-region, 1½ hr. to the S.E. of Villa Orotava. Steep
bridle-path; mule, see p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>. The chestnut and erica woods are succeeded
in the <i>Barranco de la Arena</i> by primæval *Pine Forest, near which is an
abrupt slope with huge columns of basalt, known as the <i>Organos</i> (organ-pipes).
From Agua Mansa we may either ride back by the W. margin
of the <i>Ladera de Santa Ursula</i> (p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>) and the farm of <i>La Florida</i>, or
we may cross the <i>Pedro Gil Pass</i> (6522 ft.; the top of the Cumbre, to the
S.W., commands a striking view of the E. coast and the Grand Canary)
to the grand basin of the *<i>Garganta de Güimar</i>, and along the lava-stream
of 1705, past <i>Arafo</i>, to (6–7 hrs.) <i>Güimar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The <span class='sc'>Ascent of the Peak of Teneriffe</span>, which is fatiguing but
without danger, takes two days and should be made in the warmer season
(hotel arrangement for the ascent, see p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>; tariffs for mule and guide,
also see p. <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>). The excursion affords an admirable insight into the geological
structure of the island, while the view in clear weather is of
unparallelled grandeur. The equipment most needed consists of riding
leggings, an Alpenstock (<i>lanza</i>), stout boots, a lantern, rugs, drinking-water,
abundant provisions, grey spectacles or goggles, and lanoline for
the face. In the Cañadas (see below) the guides and mule-drivers often
refuse their services when snow is falling. The shortest way to the peak
is by the bridle-path from Puerto Orotava, viâ Cruz Santa, to the Portillo.
In about 10 hrs. we reach the refuge-hut of Alta Vista, the keys of which
are brought by the guide. We may afterwards descend to Icod Alto and
Realejo Alto (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>; about 8 hrs.), where a vehicle may be ordered to meet
us; or we may descend viâ the Llano de la Maja to Güimar (p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>; 10 hrs.).</p>

<p class='c022'>Our route ascends through every climatic zone in the world. From
the tropical region of Puerto Orotava we pass, beyond <i>Cruz Santa</i> (1500 ft.),
through the <i>Taoro Basin</i> into the temperate zone, the region of maize and
cereals, where numerous cottages are shaded by chestnut-trees. Leaving
behind the thickets of <i>Monte Verde</i> and following the <i>Camino del Brezal</i>
with its view of the sombre <i>Ladera de Tigaiga</i> (p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>), we mount, beyond
the cloud-region, a wilderness of lava. A most striking change of
scenery is observed at the <i>Portillo</i> (6611 ft.), lying a little to the E. of
the Fortaleza (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>), and forming the entrance to the *<i>Montañas de las
Cañadas</i>, the lowest and oldest crater. This enormous basin, 6–12½ M.
in diameter, girdles the base of the Peak with its ring-shaped wall of
lava rocks (650–1650 ft. high), the continuity of which has, however, been
broken by later eruptions. The summit of the Peak is rarely free from
snow except in August and September. We now ride across the <i>Cañadas
Plateau</i> (midday-rest; view of the Peak), a desolate expanse of pumice-stone,
overgrown with scanty Retama (p. <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>), and in summer enlivened
by a few goats. Here and there it is intersected by huge lava-streams
and covered with isolated eruptive cones. The sky is generally cloudless,
the sun intensely hot, and the air marvellously clear. At the foot
of the lower portion of the Peak, not far from the spur of <i>Los Rastrojos</i>
(7562 ft.), begins the toilsome ascent over the grey-white pumice-stone
of the <i>Montaña Blanca</i> (8691 ft.) to the saddle adjoining the pyramid-like
peak. The zigzag path now mounts the slopes of slag, inhabited
by rabbits, mostly between streams of black obsidian, to the <i>Lomo Tiezo</i>.
In the midst of the expanse of slag shady resting-places are formed
here and there by great blocks of lava, such as the <i>Estancia de los
Ingleses</i> (9711 ft.) and the <i>Estancia de los Alemanes</i> (10,018 ft.). Below
the spot where the lava-streams unite to form the sickle-shaped <i>Piedras
Negras</i> stands the refuge-hut of <i>Alta Vista</i> (10,728 ft.; accommodation
for 15 pers. at the utmost, at 5 p. each). From this point we already
enjoy, in clear weather, an imposing view of the E. half of the island,
of the Grand Canary (p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>), and even of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote
(p. <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>), a glorious spectacle more particularly at sunset, when the Peak
gradually casts its shadow over the sea as far as the Grand Canary.</p>

<p class='c022'>Next morning we start early. The winding path ascends a field of
lava to (1 hr.) the <i>Rambleta</i> (11,713 ft.), the central crater-basin, out of
which towers the trachytic cone, covered with pumice-stone, of the <i>Pitón</i>
or <i>Pan de Azúcar</i> (‘sugar-loaf’), the summit of the **<b>Peak of Teneriffe</b>,
or <i>Pico de Teide</i> (12,175 ft.; ‘peak of hell’). In ½¾ hr. we climb its
slopes to the <i>Corona</i>, the very narrow margin of the <i>Caldera</i>, the insignificant
highest crater (77 by 110 yds.; 130 ft. in depth), which was still
active in the middle ages, but now emits a few jets of steam only from its
fumaroles (comp. p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>). When the horizon is perfectly clear, the eye
ranges over an area of some 2200 sq. M.; floating, as it were, in the midst of
the boundless expanse of the ocean, the blue of which seems to blend on
the horizon with the blue of the sky, we can sometimes see the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of the Canaries, from Palma, Hierro, and Gomera on the W. to the far-distant
E. group. To the W. we look down upon the grand crater of the
Pico Viejo (see below), the Chahorra, and the Talus de Bilma, studded with
countless coloured cinder-cones. We survey, from the Fortaleza on the
N.E. to the Morro del Cedro on the S.W., the ring-shaped wall of the
Cañadas, with the pumice-stone wilderness of the Cañadas Plateau and the
coloured lava-masses of the Azulejos (see below). The older serrated
mountains in the island (pp. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>, 33) and the green basins of Orotava and
Icod are generally shrouded by a sea of clouds of dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the <span class='sc'>Descent</span>, which experts may shorten at first by glissading
down the cinder-slopes, we may visit the <i>Cueva del Hielo</i> (11,044 ft.),
a fine lava cavern a little below the Rambleta, always filled with ice and
water. From the Montaña Blanca (p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>) we then turn to the N. to the
<i>Fortaleza</i> (8300 ft.), the only considerable height on the N. margin of the
Cañadas wall. The bridle-path, very steep and rough, next descends
to the <i>Corona de Icod</i> (about 2900 ft.), the highest point of the <i>Ladera
de Tigaiga</i> (p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>), falling away to the E. in a huge rocky slope, and
again offering a glorious view of the Vale of Orotava. From <i>Icod Alto</i>
(1716 ft.) we may descend rapidly to the N.E. to <i>Realejo Alto</i> (see below),
or we may wend our way due W. to <i>Icod de los Vinos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Round the Cañadas</span> is an interesting but toilsome excursion. From
the Portillo (p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>) we strike to the S. across the Cañadas Plateau to the
rocks of the <i>Risco Verde</i> (7130 ft.), on the E. margin of the encircling wall,
where a lava cavern serves for night-quarters. The path then leads to the
S.W., skirting the basaltic rock of <i>Las Pilas</i> (7228 ft.), passing below
the <i>Espigón Hill</i>, and along the wildly fissured and variegated <i>Roques
de la Grieta</i> (7211 ft.), where a new <i>Observatorio</i> has been built near a
spring (1909). This brings us to the <i>Guajara Hill</i> (8908 ft.), near the
<i>Guajara Pass</i> (see below). Our route, now running to the W., crosses the
so-called <i>Azulejos</i> (9400 ft.), a lava wall consisting partly of blue-green
rock, and at the <i>Boca de Tauze</i> (7021 ft.) surmounts the huge lava-streams
(of 1798 and 1909, comp. p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>) of the <i>Chahorra</i> (7743 ft.) and the <i>Pico Viejo</i>
(10,289 ft.). To the left rises the <i>Morro del Cedro</i> (8000 ft.), the highest
hill on the W. side of the crater-wall. From the N.W. side of the Cañadas,
whose girdle-wall was here almost entirely destroyed by the numerous
cones thrown up in 1705 and 1706, we next reach the *<i>Pinal de la Guancha</i>,
the finest pine-forest in the island. Thence we traverse the huge lava
slopes of the <i>Lomo de Vega</i> (5168 ft.) to the basin of <i>Icod de los Vinos</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>A somewhat shorter path from the Portillo, crossing the saddle between
the Rastrojos and the Montaña Blanca (p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>), leads to the S.W.,
in 3½ hrs., direct to the <i>Guajara Pass</i> (7992 ft.), which gives access to
the village of <i>Vilaflor</i> (4842 ft.; inn), finely situated on the S. slope of
the girdle-wall of the Cañadas amid pine-woods and luxuriant orchards,
and noted for the ‘Vilaflor embroidery’ (p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>). From the brow of the <i>Llano
de los Quemados</i> we overlook the late-volcanic terraces of the <i>Bandas del
Sur</i>, which are bare and thinly peopled. A fine excursion from Vilaflor is
made viâ <i>Escalona</i> (3750 ft.) and <i>Arona</i> (2198 ft.), with views, towards the
W., of the islands of Gomera and Hierro, to the little town of <i>Adeje</i> (935 ft.),
situated behind the <i>Adeje Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>; <i>Roque del Carasco</i>, etc.), the ancient
Guanche capital of the island. Near it is the *<i>Barranco del Infierno</i>, the
upper half of which is the grandest ravine in Teneriffe.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<span class='sc'>High Road</span>, which at the foot of the <i>Montaña de Chaves</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>) sends off a by-road to the village of <i>Realejo Alto</i> (1158 ft.),
nears the sea at the rocky headland of <i>Rambla de Castro</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>At (27½ M. from Santa Cruz) <i>Realejo Bajo</i> (883 ft.) the <i>Ladera
de Tigaiga</i> (p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>) comes close down to the coast. The next
stretch of road, as far as (32½ M.) <i>San Juan de la Rambla</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>(2000 inhab.), situated on a recent lava-stream, is particularly fine.
It leads past abrupt rocks and through sombre gorges (<i>Barranco
de la Torre</i>, <i>Barranco Ruiz</i>), and often through banana plantations
and vineyards extending to the cliffs of the coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>37½ <b>M. Icod de los Vinos</b> (755 ft.; Hot. Inglés, poor), a
small town with 2000 inhab., is the chief place in the *<i>Vale of
Icod</i>, which is bounded by the Ladera de Tigaiga, the Lomo de
Vega, and the Pinal de la Guancha (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>), rivalling the Vale
of Orotava in fertility and beauty. We enjoy here a magnificent
*View of the <i>Peak</i>, towering almost immediately above the coast,
between the Fortaleza and the Pico Viejo (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>). A garden near
the <i>Iglesia Parroquial</i> contains an old dragon-tree. The <i>Guanches’
Cave</i> below the village is not worth visiting (fee 2 p.).</p>

<p class='c016'>A pleasant way back to the Vale of Orotava is the bridle-path viâ
<i>Guancha</i>, <i>Icod Alto</i> (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>), and <i>Realejo Alto</i> (p. <a href='#Page_42'>42</a>).</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Gran Canaria</b> or ‘<i>Grand Canary</i>‘, the second-largest
island in the archipelago, nearly circular in form, with 127,000
inhab. in an area of 626 sq. M., lies about 66 M. to the S.E. of Teneriffe.
The best-watered and most fertile parts are the environs of <i>Las
Palmas</i>, the capital, and the N. coast. The barren brown mountains
in the interior, with their sharp outlines, culminate in the <i>Pico de
las Nieves</i> (6400 ft.). On every side deep barrancos or ravines descend
to the coast, conspicuous among which, as we near the island
from Teneriffe, is the <i>Barranco de Tejeda</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Isleta</i> (748 ft.), the N.E. promontory of Gran Canaria, once
a separate island, has gradually been united to the greater island
by deposits of sea-sand which form the <i>Istmo de Guanarteme</i>.
The <i>Lighthouse</i> (Faro) on the <i>Punta Morro de la Vieja</i>, on the N.
side of the Isleta, is the chief landmark for steamers coming from
Teneriffe or the N.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the Isleta, in the <i>Confital Bay</i> opening to the W., lies
<b>Puerto de la Luz</b> (Hot. Rayo, with café, pens. 6 p., a very fair
Spanish inn; comp. Plan, p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>), a rapidly rising place, the chief
port of Gran Canaria, and the best harbour in the islands. The
entrance to it is protected by a breakwater (rompeolas), about
1100 yds. long, and by the Muelle (mole) de Santa Catalina (landing
or embarking in steam-launches or small boats, 1 p., trunk 50 c.).
The hotel-agents from Las Palmas come on board.</p>

<p class='c011'>A dusty <span class='sc'>Road</span> leads from Puerto de la Luz, passing many

<p class='c009'><i>Las Palmas</i>, a town of 28,600 inhab., of a S. Spanish type like
Santa Cruz (comp. p. <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>), the seat of the bishop of Gran Canaria,
situated in 28° 6′ N. lat. and 15° 12′ W. long., is the busiest and
wealthiest town in the whole archipelago. The houses of the well-to-do
townspeople, built of pale-grey tufa or blue lava-basalt, often
enclose beautiful patios filled with plants, which are watered by
means of pipes conducted from the roofs. On the hills at the back of
the town, which have been fortified since the Spanish and American
war, are sprinkled many gaily painted country-houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Las Palmas is divided into two parts (<i>barrios</i>) by the <i>Barranco
de Guiniguada</i>: on the <i>N. Triana</i>, and on the <i>S. Vegueta</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main street of <span class='sc'>Triana</span>, with its numerous shops, in line
with the road from Puerto de la Luz, is called Calle Mayor de
Triana (Pl. B, C, 1–3). Beyond the <i>Baranquillo de Mata</i> it intersects
the Plaza San Telmo (Pl. B, 1), in which rises the <i>Gobierno
Militar</i> (Pl. 2; B, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Paseo de Bravo Murillo (Pl. B, A, 1) ascends the gorge to
the right to the Carretera del Norte (p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>). On the left is the
<i>Harbour</i> (Pl. B, C, 1), with the pier (Muelle), where the sea-breezes
may be enjoyed in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Calle Mayor de Triana, farther on, the Calle Constantino
diverges to the right to the Plaza de San Bernardo (Pl. A, B, 2),
a square planted with Indian laurels. Near the S. end of the street
the Calle del General Bravo leads to the Alameda de Colón (Pl. B, 3),
which is embellished with a bust of Columbus and fine royal and
date palms (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>). In this square rise the <i>Iglesia de San Francisco</i>
(1689) and the <i>Casino</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The central point of <span class='sc'>Vegueta</span> is the Plaza de Santa Ana (Pl. B, 4),
where the guides lie in wait for strangers. The bronze dogs at the
lower end of the plaza, as well as those in the arms of the town,
recall the tradition that Juba II. (p. <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>) carried away some dogs
(<i>canes</i>) from the island, and that their name is derived thence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The <span class='sc'>Cathedral</span> (Pl. B, C, 4; <i>San Christóbal</i>), founded in 1497
and restored in 1781, with its heavy façade flanked with towers
184 ft. high, contains, in the first chapel of the left aisle, the tombstone
of the native poet Bart. Cairasco de Figueroa (1540–1610), and
in the crypt the tomb of Viera y Clavijo (1731–1802), the historian
of the Canaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Town Hall</span> (Palacio Municipal; Pl. B, 4), built in 1842,
contains, on the third floor, the <i>Museo Canario</i>, consisting of natural
history collections and of curiosities from the Guanche caverns
of the Isleta (p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>) and other places (implements, weapons, and
tools in basalt, obsidian, horn, wood, and clay, leather-work, and
mummies). Adm. free, daily 11–3.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a prolonged stay the <i>Monte</i> is preferable to Las Palmas. It
is reached by the Carretera del Centro (comp. Pl. A, 5), the best
road in the island. Ascending from the suburb of San Roque, and
soon affording splendid views, the road at first follows the Barranco
de Guiniguada (p. <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>), and then winds up the slopes of the
<i>Pico del Viento</i> (820 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>3¾ M. <i>Tafira</i> (1230 ft.; Hotel Victoria; James’s Boarding
House), the first village on the *<b>Monte</b>, a colony of villas and a
favourite winter resort of the English.</p>

<p class='c011'>8 M. <i>Santa Brígida</i> (1572 ft.; Hot. Santa Brígida, in a fine
open situation with a beautiful park, pens. from 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; Quiney’s
Bella Vista, ½ M. below the other, pens. 8–10<i>s.</i>), a finely situated
village with 500 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road, still unfinished, goes on to Telde (p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>), passing the
curious cave-village of <i>Atalaya</i> (1720 ft.), which rises in terraces
on the hill-side. The tufa walls of the cave-dwellings are hung with
mats. The industry of the place is the manufacture of pottery,
notably the porous water-jars so common in N. Africa.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ascent of the *<i>Pico de Vandama</i> (1838 ft.) may be made
from Atalaya or direct from Santa Brígida (there and back 2 hrs.;
mule 3 p.). This hill, overgrown with pines and tree-like broom,
overlooks the grand mountain landscape of the E. coast. Very
striking is the view of the *<i>Caldera de Vandama</i>, a huge crater-basin
of about 550 yds. in diameter and 683 ft. in depth. Its floor
is planted with vines and cereals, and it is worth while to ride
down into it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Carretera del Centro leads, beyond the bifurcation for Atalaya,
to (13 M.) the little town of <b>San Mateo</b> (2575 ft.; fair inn), superbly
situated among the mountains. Rough mule-tracks lead thence to the
<i>Pico de las Nieves</i> (6400 ft.), to the village of <i>Tejeda</i> (3160 ft.) in the
*<i>Barranco de Tejeda</i> (p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>), and to the cave-village of <i>Artenara</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely less attractive than the Monte road is the *Carretera
del Sur, which leads from Las Palmas, at first passing the cemeteries,
then skirting the rocks of the E. coast, and at length turning
inland, piercing the lava-rock by a tunnel, to Ginámar and (8 M.)
<b>Telde</b> (394 ft.; inn; pop. 4000), a picturesque little town amidst
beautiful orange-groves.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The Carretera del Norte, crossing the <i>Barranco de San Lorenzo</i> and
the road from Puerto de la Luz (p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>) at <i>Tamaraceite</i>, and farther on,
beyond a long tunnel, the <i>Barranco de Tenoya</i> above the village of that
name, leads to (10 M.) <i>Arucas</i> (1017 ft.; two inns), an industrial little
town of 2900 inhab., at the foot of the <i>Montaña de Arucas</i>, a hill affording
fine views. The sugar-cane is cultivated in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c022'>A by-road diverges from this carretera, beyond the Barranco de San
Lorenzo, to (12½ M.) <i>Teror</i> (1936 ft.; dirty inn), a little town with the
famous pilgrimage-church of the Virgen del Pino (16th cent.).</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>The island of <b>Palma</b>, or <i>La Palma</i>, in the extreme N.W.
of the archipelago, 28½ M. long and 17 M. broad, lying about
16½ M. to the W. of Teneriffe, is remarkable for its fine scenery
and superb forests, but is as yet rarely visited by tourists. The
famous <i>Caldera</i>, the largest and deepest of all the crater-basins
in the islands, opens towards the W. in the huge <i>Barranco de las
Angustias</i>, while many smaller gorges render the N. coast in
particular very difficult of access. The whole of the S. part of the
island is of recent volcanic origin and therefore poorly watered.
The population (42,000, in an area of 280 sq. M.) is confined to
the S.E. margin of the island and the middle of the W. slopes
Many of the natives emigrate, especially to Cuba.</p>

<p class='c011'>Starting from Santa Cruz de Tenerife (p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>) the steamer rounds
the <i>Anaga Mts.</i>, with the lighthouse already named (p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>), and
steers to the W. from the <i>Punta del Hidalgo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>) to Palma.
The lighthouse on the <i>Punta de Teno</i> (23 ft.), the N.W. point of
Teneriffe, remains visible for some time. The bold coast of Palma
presents a grand appearance as we approach.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Santa Cruz de la Palma.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotels.</span> <i>Hot. Miramar</i>; <i>Hot.
Español</i>; <i>Hot. Internacional</i>; <i>Fonda Verbena</i>, pens. 4–5 p.—<span class='sc'>Carriage</span>
to Los Llanos 45 p. (also motor-omnibus).—<span class='sc'>Mule</span> per day 5–6, to Los
Llanos 7½ p.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Santa Cruz de la Palma</i>, the only considerable port (5700
inhab.) in the island, lies on the E. coast, on an open bay which
is much exposed to sand-drifts. The houses rise in terraces on
the steep hill-side, overtopped by tall Canary palms. The chief
export is tobacco, which is little inferior to that of Havana.
Cigar-factory of J. Cabrera Martín.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main street, in which rises the <i>Town Hall</i> (Ayuntamiento)
of 1563, leads to a picturesque triangular plaza with the church of
<i>San Salvador</i> and several handsome houses. Close by is the small
<i>Museum</i> (Museo de Historia Natural y Etnográfico). A beautiful
palm-avenue leads through the upper part of the town.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> To the N.W. we may ascend through the <i>Barranco de
la Madera</i>, with its cave-dwellings (Cuevas de los Guanches) to the loftily
situated pilgrimage-church of the <i>Virgen de las Nieves</i> (16th cent.);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>thence either to the <i>Montaña de Tagoje</i> (about 3300 ft.; with grand view
of the E. coast, of Gomera and Teneriffe), or to the <i>Pico del Cedro</i>
(7471 ft.) on the E. margin of the <i>Caldera</i> (see below), round which we
may ride to the <i>Roque de los Muchachos</i> (7693 ft.) on the N. side.—To
the S.W., following the old bridle-path which cuts off the windings of
the road, we may walk or ride to (1 hr.) <i>Buena Vista</i> (about 660 ft.),
whence a rough mule-track ascends to the (2 hrs.) <i>Cumbre Nueva</i>
(4593 ft.), the chief mountain-pass in the island, where we have a grand
*View of the abrupt rocks and the pine-woods of the central chain, of
the fertile plains to the W., and of the distant Peak of Teneriffe. Then
we proceed through pine-forest, past the venerable ‘Pino de la Virgen’,
to <i>El Paso</i> (2060 ft.; inn), whence we may ascend the <i>Cumbrecita</i> (4445 ft.)
and the <i>Idafe</i>, the sacred mount of the Guanches, on the S. margin of
the Caldera. Finally we descend to the (3 hrs.) little town of <i>Los Llanos</i>
(1000 ft.; poor inn, bargaining advisable). From Los Llanos it takes a
day (7–8 hrs., there and back) to visit the *<b>Caldera</b>, a vast basin, nearly
5900 ft. deep and 3–4½ M. in diameter, situated in the heart of the island
and rarely quite cloudless. A tedious ride up the <i>Barranco de las
Angustias</i> brings us to the farm-building of <i>Tenera</i> (3642 ft.), whence
we look down on the floor of the Caldera, which is partly clothed with
pines. The best way to return from Los Llanos to Santa Cruz is to drive
(34½ M.) by the road passing <i>Las Manchas</i>, <i>Fuencaliente</i> (2297 ft.), <i>Mazo</i>
(1312 ft.), and <i>Breña Baja</i>; or we may ride across the <i>Cumbre Vieja</i>
(6660 ft.), the pass between Las Manchas and the <i>Barranco Aduares</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Andalusia</i>, the southmost region of Spain, is geologically of somewhat recent origin. In the tertiary period the sea still washed
the southern shores of the Iberian tableland, until a pressure acting
in a direction from S. to N. gradually lifted up a new coast in long
parallel folds, while the Mediterranean forced a new passage to
the ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar (comp. p. xxix). Latest
of all appeared the Guadalquivir Bay, the highest point of whose
coast scarcely rises 490 ft. above the sea. The coast-hills, which
have their counterpart in the Rîf Mts. on the African side (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>),
stretch in the main from E. to W., descending abruptly to the sea.
Transverse fissures, in which volcanic activity is still indicated
by frequent earthquakes, divide the coast into several different
chains, which culminate in the <i>Sierra Nevada</i> (11,421 ft.; ‘snow-mountain’),
the highest peak in Spain. The W. chain (<i>Serranía
de Ronda</i>) trends round to the N. In contrast to the <i>Andalucía
Alta</i>, the folded region facing the Mediterranean, the <i>Andalucía
Baja</i>, the basin of the Guadalquivir, opens towards the Atlantic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The <i>Guadalquivir</i> (Arabic <i>Wâd al-Kebîr</i>, ‘the great river’), the
<i>Bætis</i> of antiquity, rises indeed in the Sierra de Cazorla, apart
from the coast-mountains, but receives its more copious affluents,
particularly the <i>Guadiana Menor</i>, from the Sierra Nevada. After
a wild career it enters the plain beyond Montoro, becomes navigable
at Cordova, and even carries sea-going vessels at Seville.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Fuller details in <i>Baedeker’s Spain and Portugal</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>History</span> of the country dates from hoar antiquity. It was
the <i>Tarshish</i> of the Bible, being already named in the generations
of Noah (Gen. x. 4), and was called by the Greeks <i>Tartessós</i>, the
home of precious metals, especially of silver, the source of the
wealth of Tyre. Here, too, are the rich copper mines of <i>Rio Tinto</i>
and <i>Tharsis</i>, which were already worked in the ancient Iberian
age. The Mediterranean peoples contented themselves with visiting
the harbours established in the bays of the coast, leaving it to the
natives to bring the produce of the interior down to them across
the mountains or by the river Bætis. Thus arose, probably even
before the foundation of Cadiz, the Phœnician towns of <i>Málaca</i>
(Málaga) and <i>Kalpe</i> (Gibraltar), besides other small settlements.
About 1100 B.C. <i>Gadîr</i> or <i>Gades</i>, the westmost of these, appears
in history, and afterwards became dependent on Carthage. The art
of writing, the first and most potent aid to commerce, was propagated
from Gades, which thereby laid the foundation of the higher civilization
of the peninsula. Summoned to their aid by the Gaditanians,
the Carthaginians, who had already gained possession of the Balearic
Islands, invaded Iberia. After the Punic Wars (p. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>) came the
domination of the Romans, who in 27 A.D. gave the whole of
S. Spain the name of <i>Provincia Baetica</i>. On the break-up of the
Roman Empire Andalusia was overrun by the Vandals (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), the
Suevi, and the Visigoths. At length the Arabs and the Berbers of
Morocco obtained a footing here, after they had crossed the Straits
of Gibraltar under Târik (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>). By them this region, and afterwards
the whole peninsula which they conquered, were named <i>El-Andalûs</i>
(‘land of the West’). Down to the 13th cent. the Moors
occupied Andalusia, and it was not till 1492 that Granada was
captured by Ferdinand V., the Catholic.</p>

<p class='c011'>These vicissitudes in the country’s history are still reflected in
its present <span class='sc'>Inhabitants</span>. Half African, half European, like the
Maltese, the Sicilians, and the Sardinians, the Andalusians have
inherited something of the character, the customs, and the language
of all the nations that once held sway in this region. To
this day the Andalusian dialect swarms with Arabic words; almost
all the terms used in agriculture and irrigation are Arabic. The
popular dances and music are of Oriental origin. To their Oriental
ancestry the Andalusian (<i>Andaluz</i>, <i>Andaluza</i>) also owes his exuberant
imagination. There can be no greater contrast than that
which the calm and proud Old-Castilian presents to the volatile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and excitable Andalusian, who is apt to substitute fancy for fact,
who sees everything as through a magnifying glass, and who is
therefore much given to exaggeration (<i>fanfarronadas</i>). On the
other hand nothing can be more charming than the bearing of an
Andalusian ‘maja’, who is admired rather for her wit, her grace,
and her power of repartee than for her beauty. The <i>Sal Andaluza</i>
is as proverbial as the Attic ‘salt’ of the ancients.</p>

<p class='c011'>Andalusia can boast of possessing, not only some of the finest
and most interesting Moorish <span class='sc'>Buildings</span> in Spain, such as the
mosque at Cordova, the Giralda and Alhambra at Granada, but
also several of the grandest monuments of the ‘reconquista’ period.
Among these are the Alcázar of Seville, one of the most brilliant
creations of the so-called Mudejar, or Moorish-Christian style, and
the grand cathedrals of Seville and Granada in the Gothic and
‘plateresque’, or Spanish early-Renaissance, styles.—Nor is the
<span class='sc'>Scenery</span> of this region less attractive. Andalusia may be said to
stand in the same relation to Spain as Sicily to Italy, or as Provence
to the rest of France. It combines all that the rest of the
peninsula possesses locally or partially. To the E. are vast plateaux
and steppes, frozen in winter and parched in summer; to the S.
rise snow-clad mountains; on the S.W. are the sand-dunes of the
Atlantic coast; olive-groves thrive on the Guadalquivir; and on
the shores of the Mediterranean are well-watered vegas where the
cotton-plant, the banana, and the sugar-cane flourish.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Mediterranean Travellers</span> will hardly have time for more than a
circular tour from Gibraltar to Tangier, Cadiz, Seville, Cordova, Granada,
and back to Gibraltar, or, in unfavourable weather, to Algeciras, Bobadilla,
and Seville only. The Spanish railways (see the <i>Guía general de
Ferrocarriles</i>; 1 p., smaller edition 75 c.) are far inferior to the British
or to the French, and their speed is very low. The natives travel mostly
in the second or third class, but the carriages cannot be recommended.
The first class often has a <i>berlina</i>, or coupé-carriage with four seats,
which affords an unimpeded view (higher fare).</p>

<p class='c022'>In the larger towns one may book luggage (<i>facturar el equipaje</i>)
1–2 hrs. before the departure of the train, at the <i>despacho central</i>, or
town-office. Booking it at the station itself is a very slow process. As
in France luggage up to 30 kilos (66 lbs.) is free. The ticket for it is called
a <i>talón</i> or <i>boletín de equipaje</i>. The porter (<i>mozo</i>), often most importunate,
receives 30–50 c. or more.</p>

<p class='c022'>Andalusia possesses few first-class hotels. The better second-class
inns are similar to the French and Italian. Even for a stay of a single
day it is usual to pay an inclusive charge for bed and board (<i>pupilaje</i>,
from 6 to 20 p.). Déjeuner or lunch (11–1 o’clock) is called <i>almuerzo</i>;
dinner, <i>comida</i> (at or after 7); table-wine, <i>vino común</i> or <i>de mesa</i>. No
allowance is made for meals omitted. An extra charge is often made for
breakfast (coffee, etc.), which Spanish travellers usually take in their own
rooms. Notice of departure should be given as early as possible, lest a
whole additional day be charged for. The usual fee to the servants
(<i>camarero</i>, waiter; <i>muchacha</i>, chamber-maid; <i>mozo</i>, boots), who are apt
to be lazy and inattentive, is 1 p. per day, divided among them, or more
in proportion for families.</p>

<p class='c022'>The beer-houses are called <i>cervecerías</i>. The cafés are usually open
in the afternoon and evening only. <i>Café con leche</i> is coffee with milk;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><i>café solo</i> is without milk. Newspapers (<i>periódicos</i>) are not provided by
the cafés. Tobacco and cigars are a government monopoly; the shop is
called <i>estanco</i>; there are also special shops for the better Havana cigars.</p>

<p class='c022'>The post-offices (<i>correo</i>), even in the larger towns, are often open for
a few hours only. The hours for obtaining poste-restante (<i>cartas en lista</i>)
or registered letters (<i>cartas certificadas</i>) are often changed; the addressee
must show his visiting-card (<i>tarjeta</i>) at the office. Stamps (<i>sellos de correo</i>;

<p class='c022'>The Spanish <i>peseta</i> (p.), divided into 100 <i>centimos</i> (c.), is scarcely
equal to the franc in value. The only valid banknotes are those of the
Madrid <i>Banco de España</i>. The 5 p. piece is popularly called a <i>duro</i>;
the 10 c. and 5 c. copper coins are often termed <i>perro grande</i> and <i>perro
chico</i> (‘big and little dog’) in jocular allusion to the lions in the coat-of-arms.
Change should be examined carefully, as base coin is common.—At
Gibraltar the currency is English, but Spanish money is received, except
at the post and telegraph office.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Arrival.</b> The ocean-going steamers land and embark their passengers
in their own steam-tenders at any time before sunset at the Commercial
Pier (fare for each pers. 1<i>s.</i> either way). The tariff for small boats is 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for a row in the harbour, or to or from the steamboats, for 1–2 pers.,
and 1<i>s.</i> for each addit. person; luggage up to 56 lbs. free; excess, 6<i>d.</i>
per 56 lbs.; or a bargain may be made (l–2<i>s.</i> for passenger, incl. luggage).
In bad weather the tariff is raised, in accordance with the signals (red,
blue, bluish-white), to one-third more, or double, or triple fare. The
porters are notorious for their extortionate demands. The charge for conveying
luggage to the hotel should be fixed beforehand.—The <i>Custom
House Examination</i> at the harbour-gate is confined to tobacco, spirits,
and weapons. Foreigners require a permit from the <i>Police Office</i> (Pl. 2)
to spend the day on shore, and if they intend to spend the night the
permit must be renewed by their landlord. Between 5.30 and 8.15, according
to the season, a cannon-shot (gun-fire) announces the closing of the

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>One Day</span> (or even less when time presses). Walk through the town to

Bay</i> also (p. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>).—Foreigners are not admitted to the fortifications, photographing
or sketching which is prohibited.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Gibraltar</i>, a town of 23,450 inhab. (incl. the garrison of
5100 men), the key of the Mediterranean, and one of the most
important coast-fortresses in the world, in British possession since
1704, and headquarters of the Atlantic Fleet, lies on the W. slope
of a huge rock, which is connected with the Spanish mainland by
a sandy isthmus only. The famous rock bounds the Bay of Algeciras
or Gibraltar on the E. ‘It is the very image of an enormous
lion, crouched between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and set
there to guard the passage for its British mistress’ (Thackeray).</p>

<p class='c011'>The rock is composed of Jurassic limestone, overlying Silurian
slate, and extending from N. to S.; it is 3 M. long and ¾ M. in
breadth, with a saddle separating <i>Mt. Rockgun</i> (1356 ft.), the lower
hill on the N., from the <i>Signal Station</i>, the <i>Highest Point</i> (1396 ft.),
and the <i>Sugar Loaf Hill</i> (<i>O’ Hara’s Tower</i>, 1361 ft.) on the S.
Its grey masses ascend gradually in terraces on the W. and S. sides,
and rise almost perpendicularly on the E. and N. sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Town of Gibraltar</span> (‘North Town’) covers a third of the
W. slope to the N., while the remaining two-thirds are occupied
by the Alameda, numerous pretty villas, the barracks of the <i>South
Town</i>, and the <i>Lighthouse</i> on Europa Point. The houses rise in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>terraces to a height of 260 ft.; the streets are narrow and dark,
and are relieved by few squares. The natives are chiefly Spaniards
and descendants of many different Mediterranean races. The
numerous Moroccans, mostly dealers from Tangier, indicate the
proximity of the African coast. The cleanness of the town and the
absence of beggars produce a pleasant impression. The Coal Stores
on the South Mole (along with those of Algiers and Malta) supply
the vessels bound for the Suez Canal (about 1200 annually). There
is little other trade except the import of cattle and provisions from
Galicia and Morocco.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ancient name of the rock was <i>Kalpe</i>, while the hills on the
African side were called <i>Abyla</i> (now Sierra Bullones; p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>). Together
they were known as the ‘Pillars of Hercules’, the entrance to the ocean.
Under the protection of the divine Hercules-Melkarth, the Phœnicians
ventured through the straits, even as far as Britain, whence they brought
the earliest tidings from the North and also cargoes of tin, which they
mixed with copper to produce bronze. <i>Kalpe</i> was also the name of the
first Phœnician settlement on the bay of Gibraltar, while <i>Carteia</i>, on
the inner part of the bay, was probably of ancient Iberian origin. Carteia
was still an important harbour under the Carthaginians, and in 171 B. C.
it became the first Roman colony in the whole peninsula. Nothing is
recorded of the period which succeeded the invasion of the Vandals (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>).
At length in 711 the bay re-appears in history, when <i>Mûsa</i>, the governor
appointed by the Caliph of Damascus, sent the Berber <i>Târik ibn Ziyâd</i>
across from Ceuta to the bay of Algeciras on an expedition against Spain,
in which he defeated the Visigoths at Veger de la Frontera, near Cape
Trafalgar (p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>). Impressed by the commanding position of the rock of
Gibraltar, Târik afterwards erected a fort upon it, which formed the
nucleus of the Moorish castle (p. <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>). From him is derived the name of <i>Jebel
Târik</i>, ‘mountain of Târik’, corrupted into Gibraltar. In 1309 Gibraltar
was captured by <i>Al. Pérez de Guzmán</i> (<i>el Bueno</i>) for Ferdinand IV. of
Castile; the Moors recaptured it in 1333, but in 1462 lost it again to the
Spaniards. In consequence of the plundering of Gibraltar by Algerian
pirates under <i>Kheireddin</i> (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), Charles V. ordered the fortifications
to be reconstructed and new ramparts to be built from the S. side of the
town to the crest of the hill. In 1610 the Spanish Admiral <i>Mendoza</i> caused
the last Moriscoes of Andalusia to be sent back to Morocco from this very
port, where their ancestors had so long held sway, and whence they had
gone forth to conquer the whole peninsula. After having undergone ten
sieges at various periods, the fortress was surprised and captured by the
British fleet under <i>Adm. George Rooke</i> and <i>Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt</i>
in 1704, during the Spanish War of Succession, and was stoutly
and successfully defended by them during a six months’ bombardment
by the Spaniards and the French (1704–5). The thirteenth siege (1727)
and the ‘great siege’ by the French and the Spaniards (1779–83) were also
unsuccessful, the British commander then being <i>Gen. Eliott</i>, afterwards
Lord Heathfield. By the Peace of Versailles, in 1783, Great Britain was
confirmed in her possession of the historic rock.</p>

<p class='c016'>The older <span class='sc'>Fortifications</span> on the coast, from Land Port on the N. to
Europa Point on the S., those on the S. slope of the rock above Europa
Point, and those on the N. side (the famous underground galleries, p. <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>)
have in late years been strengthened by the construction of a fort on the
summit of the hill, armed with guns of the largest calibre.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the <i>Old Mole</i>, dating from 1309, and lately prolonged
by the <i>North Mole</i>, we pass through the <i>Old Mole Gate</i> (the outer
gate of the harbour), and then, beyond the <i>Market</i>, through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>inner <i>Waterport Gate</i>, which stands on the site of the old Moorish
wharf. This brings us to the S. E. to <span class='sc'>Casemates Square</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjacent, on the S., is <span class='sc'>Waterport Street</span>, with the chief
buildings, forming, together with the parallel street to the W.
called <i>Irish Town</i>, the chief business quarter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Waterport Street is prolonged to the S. by <span class='sc'>Church Street</span>.
Beyond Commercial Square and the <i>Exchange</i> (Pl. 3) we come to
the Catholic <i>Cathedral</i> (Pl. 4), on the left, originally a mosque,
but restored by the ‘Catholic kings’ (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>) after 1502; there now
remains little worth seeing except the Moorish orange-court.—A
little farther on, on the same side is the <i>Supreme Court</i> (Pl. 7),
with its pretty garden. To the right, in Cathedral Square, stands
the <i>Anglican Cathedral</i> (Pl. 6), built in the Moorish style.</p>

<p class='c011'>The southmost part of this line of streets is <span class='sc'>Southport Street</span>,
where, on the right, rises the <i>Convent</i>, once a Franciscan establishment,
now the <i>Government House</i> (governor, Sir Arch. Hunter),
the garden of which contains a venerable dragon-tree (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>). At
the S. end of this street is <i>Southport Gate</i>, which is always open,
dating from the time of Charles V., but restored in 1883. Outside
the gate, on the left, is the small <i>Trafalgar Cemetery</i>, where the
British who fell at the battle of Trafalgar (p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>) are buried.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Alameda</b>, beyond the gate, a fine promenade with rich
subtropical vegetation, was laid out by Governor George Don in
1814. A military band plays near the Assembly Rooms (p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>) on
Sun. and Wed. from 3–5, or in summer in the evening. To the W.
we overlook the <i>Naval Harbour</i>, with its dockyard, quays, and
long <i>South Mole</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the E. of the Southport Gate is <i>Prince Edward’s
Gate</i>, a second exit to the S. from the town, whence the *<b>Europa
Main Road</b> ascends gently along the W. slope of the rock, above
the Alameda Gardens, between gardens and villas. Below it, on the
right, farther on, are the <i>Naval Hospital</i> and the <i>Buena Vista
Barracks</i>. Lastly, a little way short of a signal-station, we descend
between the fissured rocks of the <i>Europa Pass</i> to (1½ M.) <i>Europa
Point</i>, with its great <i>Lighthouse</i>, the much-eroded S. extremity of
the peninsula. The road then turns to the N., soon affording a view
of the Spanish Mediterranean coast, to the <i>Governor’s Cottage</i> and
the <i>Monkeys’ Cave</i> hidden among the rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Moorish Castle</i>, above the artillery barracks, begun by
Târik in 713 and completed in 742, is entered through the Civil
Prison (verbal permission required by foreigners). Access to the
<i>Subterranean Galleries</i> of the fortress, lying below the castle and
dating from 1782 (comp. p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>), is now limited to British subjects.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Market (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>) we may walk to the N. E. to the
<i>Land Port</i> (notice as to closing should be observed; comp. p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>),
and past the <i>Inundation</i>, a space which may be flooded for defensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>purposes (made in 1705), to the <b>North Front</b>, which forms part
of the low neck of land below the N. slopes of the rock. From this
point the Devil’s Tower Road leads to the S.E., past the <i>Cemeteries</i>,
to the <i>Devil’s Tower</i> (10 min. from the Land Fort), probably an old
Genoese watch-tower. The road then turns to the S. to <i>Catalan
Bay</i>, below the E. flank of the rock, just allowing room for the
little fishing-village of <i>Caleta</i>. The rocks contain several caves.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beyond the <i>Neutral Ground</i>, 550 yds. in breadth, we come to the
Spanish town of <i>Linea de la Concepción</i> (29,600 inhab.), 1¼ M. to the
N. of Gibraltar, which owes its origin to the old Spanish lines of defence,
long since demolished. The place is uninteresting.</p>

W. to the Calle de Castelar, the main street of the new town, and
the <i>Plaza de Toros</i> (bull-ring). From the railed-in platforms of
the <i>Paseo de la Merced</i>, a park a little to the N.W. of the plaza,
we enjoy a fine view, with the foaming <i>Guadalevin</i>, or Guadiaro,
some 660 ft, below us. The <i>Puente Nuevo</i>, crossing at the S. end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of the main street (p. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>) from the new town to the old town, affords
a splendid view of the *<i>Ravine</i> of the Guadalevin (<i>El Tajo</i>, ‘the
cutting’), about 330 ft. deep and filled with the spray of the river.
The bed of the latter is strewn with rocks and the abrupt sides of
the gorge are thickly overgrown with cactus.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train descends between olives and cork-trees into the
valley of the <i>Guadalete</i> (p. <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>), and then cuts through the last

<p class='c011'>110 M. <b>Bobadilla</b> (1240 ft.; Rail. Restaur.) is the junction

(p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>). Opposite, on the Spanish coast, where the hills gradually
recede, at the N.W. end of the shallow <i>Bay of Barbate</i>, rises <i>Cape

<p class='c009'><i>Seville</i>, Span. <i>Sevilla</i> (33 ft.), a city of 145,300 inhab., the
capital of Andalusia and of the province of Sevilla, the seat of an
Archbishop and of a University, lies in a broad plain on the left
bank of the tawny <i>Guadalquivir</i>, opposite the suburb of <i>Triana</i>.
At flood-tide sea-going vessels of 23 ft. draught can ascend the river
to the quays of Seville, which, though 54½ M. from the sea, can
thus claim to be a seaport. The harbour is annually entered by about
1000 vessels, of 1¼ millions aggregate tonnage. The city combines
the features of a seaport with gay scenes of popular life and a
wealth of treasures of art. The houses in the narrow winding
streets, the heritage of the Moorish period, often contain charming
inner courts, called <i>pátios</i>, where the inhabitants spend most of
their time in summer. The larger <i>plazas</i> or squares are mostly
planted with oranges or palm-trees.</p>

<p class='c016'>Seville, as its ancient name <i>Hispalis</i> indicates, was originally an
Iberian settlement. Ever since the 2nd cent. B. C. its navigable river has
made Seville a place of importance. In 411 it became the capital of the
Vandals (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), and in 441 the seat of the Visigoth kings, who however
migrated in 567 to the more central Toledo. During the Moorish period
Seville, alternately with Marakesh, was a favourite residence of the
Almoravides and Almohades (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>); and particularly under <i>Yûsuf Abû
Yakûb</i> (1163–84) and under <i>Yakûb ibn Yûsuf</i> (1184–98), surnamed <i>Al-Mansûr</i>
(‘the victorious’), it was embellished with many sumptuous buildings,
and for a time it even surpassed Cordova in population. The
Christian period begins with Frederick III. (‘the saint’) of Castile, who
captured the city in 1248 and made it his residence. Among his descendants
was Pedro I. (1350–69), surnamed ‘the Cruel’, of whom many
anecdotes are still current. Since the discovery of America Seville has
prospered greatly and vies with Cadiz as one of the chief ports of Spain.</p>

<p class='c022'>At Seville were born Spain’s two greatest painters, <i>Velázquez</i> (1599–1660;
court-painter at Madrid from 1623 onwards) and <i>Murillo</i> (1617–82).
Here too is laid the scene of several famous operas: <i>Mozart’s</i> Don Juan
and Figaro, <i>Rossini’s</i> Barber of Seville, and <i>Bizet’s</i> Carmen.</p>

<p class='c022'>See ‘Seville’, by <i>W. M. Gallichan</i>, in the ‘Mediæval Towns Series’
(London, 1903); and ‘Seville’, by <i>A. J. Calvert</i> (London, 1907).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. The Plaza del Triunfo with the Alcázar and the Cathedral.</h4>

<p class='c021'>We begin our walk at the <span class='sc'>Plaza del Triunfo</span> (Pl. F, 3), which
is bounded by three imposing edifices, the Lonja on the W. side,
the Alcázar on the S., and the Cathedral on the N.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Casa Lonja</b> (Pl. F, 3), the Exchange, built in the high-Renaissance
style in 1583–98, contains on the upper floor the
Archivo General de Indias, with the Spanish charters and deeds
relating to the discovery and government of America and the Philippines.
Fine view from the roof, especially of the Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Alcázar</b> (Pl. F, 3; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>), originally a castle of
the Almohade Yûsuf Abû Yakûb (1181; see above), dates in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>present form mainly from the time of kings Pedro I. (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>) and
Henry II. (1369–79), who caused the castle to be restored by
Moorish architects in the Mudejar style (p. <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>). Later alterations
date from the reigns of Charles V. (1526), Philip II. (1569), and
Philip IV. (1624), while modern restorations (1857–89) have materially
changed the character of the interior.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Exterior</span> with its pinnacled corner-towers, still has the character
of a mediæval castle. From the entrance in the S.E. angle of
the Plaza del Triunfo we first cross the large Patio de las Banderas, in
which are the ticket-office and a vaulted gateway (‘apeadero’). Thence
we may proceed straight to the garden (see below), or to the right to
the Patio de la Montería, the inner court, planted with oranges and
palms. Very striking is the splendid *<span class='sc'>Chief Façade</span> of the inner Alcázar.
The beautiful windows and side-entrances are framed with toothed arches;
above them runs a rich stalactite frieze crowned with a far-projecting
timber roof resting on quaint corbels. Arabic inscriptions in Cufic characters
(p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>) serve for decoration.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Apartments</span> in the interior are grouped round the Patio de las
Doncellas (‘court of the maidens’), erected in 1369–79, but almost entirely
rebuilt under Charles V. and Philip II. The lower story is preceded by
superb Moorish arcades resting on coupled Renaissance columns. The
upper walls in open-work are richly embellished with stucco. The chief
rooms on the groundfloor are, on the S.E., the Salón de Carlos Quinto
with its fine ‘azulejos’ (or tiles) and timber ceiling; on the S.W., the
quadrangular domed *Salón de Embajadores, also richly decorated with
azulejos, and the Patio de las Muñecas (dolls’ court), modern in its upper
parts, so called from the figures which adorn it.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the Apeadero (see above) we may lastly visit the <span class='sc'>Garden</span> of
the Alcázar, with its luxuriant vegetation, a pavilion of the time of
Charles V., a grotto, and fountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>Returning to the Plaza del Triunfo, we face the Cathedral, with
the Capilla Real (p. <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>), projecting on the E., and the clock-tower
at the N.E. angle of the church, the famous—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Giralda</b> (Pl. F, 3), the conspicuous landmark of the city.
It was originally the minaret of the principal Moorish mosque,
built in brick by the architect <i>Jâbir</i> for Yakûb ibn Yûsuf (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>)
in 1184–96. The tower tapers slightly towards the top and is
remarkable for its harmonious proportions. It is square in form,
each side being 45 ft. long, and its walls are 7 ft. thick. The
upper wall-surfaces adjoining the windows, at a height of about
80 ft. above the ground, are diapered with a network of Arabesque-like
sunken panels, and are further enlivened with niches.
Instead of being crowned with a pinnacled platform (see altar-piece,
p. <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>), the tower now has a belfry (1568), capped by a small
dome (305 ft.), on which stands the <i>Girardillo</i>, or vane, a bronze
female figure representing Faith.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *Ascent (p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>) is most enjoyable towards evening. Entrance by
the door in the S.E. angle. An easy inclined plane, in 35 sections, and
ending in 16 steps, ascends to the first gallery, where the bells are hung,
and where we enjoy a very extensive view.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Calle de Alemanes, on the N. side of the Cathedral, is
the main entrance to the *<b>Patio de los Naranjos</b> (Pl. F, 3;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>‘orange-court’), once the court of the mosque. The handsome entrance-gateway,
called Puerta del Perdón, dates from the Moorish
period. The bronze-mounted *Doors and the knockers, in the Mudejar
style, and the sculptures (1519) are additions of the Christian
period. The old artesonado or coffered ceiling was replaced in
1833 by a tower.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this picturesque court, where the faithful used to perform
their ablutions at a fountain (al-mîdâ) before entering the sacred
precincts, we stand opposite the Cathedral; on the right is the
<i>Sagrario</i> (p. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>); on the left is the <i>Biblioteca Colombina</i>, or
cathedral library, founded in 1539 by Fernando Colón, Columbus’s
son, above which towers the Giralda.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the orange-court the cathedral may be entered by the
Puerta de los Naranjos or (on the left) by the Puerta del Lagarto.
It is preferable, however, to enter on the W. side, from the Calle
del Gran Capitán.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. F, 3; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>), one of the grandest
and most sumptuous Gothic churches in the whole of Christendom,
occupies the site of the principal Moorish mosque, which
was erected by Yûsuf Abû Yakûb in 1171. It was begun by unknown
architects in 1402, and in its chief parts was completed in
1506. The dome having collapsed in 1511, it was rebuilt from
designs by <i>Juan Gil de Ontañón</i> in 1517, and having in 1888
again fallen in it was restored by <i>Casanova</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>W. Façade</span>, which was not completed till 1827, as well
as the E. façade, is remarkable for the wealth of sculpture on its
portals. On the two lateral gateways in particular, the Puerta del
Bautismo (left) and the Puerta del Nacimiento (right), we note the
beautiful terracotta figures by <i>Pedro Millán</i> (about 1500), of semi-northern
character.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Interior</span> has a nave with double aisles, two rows of side-chapels,
a transept which does not project beyond the main walls,
a choir in the centre, and a Capilla Mayor containing the high-altar.
Exclusive of the Capilla Real, the church is 383 ft. long and
249 ft. in width. The nave is 53 ft. wide and 132 ft. high, the
aisles are each 36 ft. wide and 85 ft. in height. The marble pavement
is of the 18th cent., the fine stained glass of the 16th–19th
centuries. The screen (reja) and the Gothic stalls (sillería) of the
choir were almost entirely destroyed by the last collapse of the
dome. The huge high-altar (retablo) in the Capilla Mayor is a
masterpiece of Gothic wood-carving (1482–1564).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Side Chapels</span> and the <span class='sc'>Sacristies</span> form a veritable museum
of sculpture and painting, but are very badly lighted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjoining the Puerta Mayor, the chief portal of the W. façade,
are the Altar del Santo Angel, with a picture by <i>Murillo</i> (the
‘Angel de la Guarda’ or guardian angel), and the small Altar del
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Nacimiento, containing admirable pictures by <i>Luis de Vargas</i>
(1502–68; ‘Adoration of the Child’ and the ‘Four Evangelists’).</p>

<p class='c011'>The fourth chapel in the S. aisle, the Capilla de Hermenegildo,
contains the fine Gothic monument of Archbp. Juan de Cervantes
(d. 1453), by <i>Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña</i>.—In the S. transept
rises the very curious sarcophagus of Columbus, placed in the
cathedral of Havana in 1892 and brought to Spain in 1899. To the
right stands the Altar de la Gamba, with the famous painting by
<i>Luis de Vargas</i>, the so-called Generación, or Adoration of the
Immaculate Conception by Adam and Eve, generally known as ‘La
Gamba’, from the finely drawn and painted leg of Adam.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the Capilla de los Dolores we pass into the <span class='sc'>Sacristía
de los Cálices</span>, built in the late-Gothic style by <i>Diego de Riaño</i>
(d. 1533) and <i>Martin Gainza</i> (d. 1566), where we obtain tickets
of admission to the closed chapels, etc. (see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>). In front of
us is a famous *Crucifix, by <i>Martínez Montañés</i> (d. 1649), the most
typical of Andalusian sculptors; on the left are a SS. Justa and
Rufina, by <i>Goya</i> (1817), and St. Dorothea by <i>Murillo</i>. On the
window-wall is St. John the Evangelist, by <i>Zurbarán</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjacent to the Antesala is the *<span class='sc'>Sacristía Mayor</span>, a magnificent
room in the plateresque style, also built, after 1532, by
<i>Riaño</i> and <i>Gainza</i>, containing the rich treasury of the cathedral
and three valuable pictures, a Descent from the Cross, by <i>Pedro
Campaña</i> (1548), and SS. Leander and Isidore by <i>Murillo</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Capilla del Mariscal possesses an altar-piece in ten sections,
the Presentation in the Temple, by <i>Pedro Campaña</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The elliptical *<span class='sc'>Sala Capitular</span>, begun by <i>Riaño</i> and <i>Gainza</i>
in 1530 but not finished till after 1582, has a Doric entablature
resting on Ionic mural columns, while the decoration is plateresque
(Span. Renaissance). The eight ovals between the windows and the
fine picture of the Immaculate Conception are by <i>Murillo</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the E. side of the church we pass through a high railing
(1773) into the <span class='sc'>Capilla Real</span> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>), a Renaissance edifice
by <i>Gainza</i> and others (1551–75), on the site of the old royal
vaults. By the entrance, right and left, are the tombs of Alfonso
the Wise (d. 1284) and his mother Queen Beatrice of Swabia. In
the apse is preserved the reliquary of St. Ferdinand (Ferdinand III.
of Castile; p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>), who, as well as Pedro I., is interred in the ‘Panteón’
under the chapel.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the N. aisle, beyond the Puerta del Lagarto (p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>) is the
Capilla de los Evangelistas, whose altar-piece is by <i>Ferd. Sturm</i>
(1559); on the predella, to the left, below, are SS. Justa and Rufina
with the Giralda in its original form (p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>). In the Capilla de
Santiago (St. James) is a *Picture of that saint, by <i>Juan de las
Roelas</i> (1609). Most famous of all is a **<i>Murillo</i> in the Capilla
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>del Bautisterio (forenoon light best), the Infant Christ appearing
to St. Antony of Padua (1656).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Puerta del Sagrario, the last door on the N. side of the
cathedral, leads into the <b>Sagrario</b>, built as a parish-church in the
baroque style in 1618–62, with a single vault 75 ft. high. The
altar-piece on the left is a fine half-figure of the Mater Dolorosa
by <i>Montañés</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The Central and Eastern Quarters.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The lively Calle Génova or Cánovas del Castillo leads from the
Cathedral to the <span class='sc'>Plaza de la Constitución</span> (Pl. E, 3), the focus
of the city traffic. On the right is the <i>Audiencia</i>, containing the
law-courts; on the left, between this plaza and the large Plaza
Nueva or de San Fernando (Pl. E, 4), rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Casa del Ayuntamiento</b> (Pl. E, 4), or town-hall, a Renaissance
edifice (1526–64) designed by <i>Diego de Riaño</i> (p. <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>).
The richly decorated S. part is one of the most charming creations
of the plateresque style.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the Audiencia begins the *<span class='sc'>Calle de las Sierpes</span> (Pl. E,
D, 3), or ‘street of serpents’, so named after the sign-board of an
old inn. It contains the chief cafés and clubs and the largest shops,
and it presents a very lively scene in the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>This street forms the best starting-point for a walk through
the E. quarters of the town. The first lateral street on the right,
the Calle Sagasta, leads to the church of <i>San Salvador</i> (Pl. D,
E, 3), which contains a statue of Christ by Montañés (2nd altar
on the right). From the S.E. angle of that church the Cuesta del
Rosario leads to—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>San Isidoro</i> (Pl. E, 3), where at the high-altar a celebrated
masterpiece by Roelas, the Death of St. Isidore (El Tránsito), was
once closely studied by Murillo.—From San Isidoro the Calle
Almirante Hoyos and Calle de Aguilas, which contain several fine
patios, lead to the Plaza de Pilatos.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Casa de Pilatos</b> (Pl. E, 2; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>), the property
of the Duque de Medinaceli, was probably begun early in
the 16th cent. by Christian-Moorish architects for the Ribera
family. As a member of that family had been to Jerusalem, the
building was popularly supposed to be a copy of Pilate’s house.
The architecture shows a curious but harmonious blend of Moorish,
Gothic, and Renaissance elements.</p>

<p class='c016'>The beautiful Patio, with its colonnade and fountain, contains several
antiques; in the angles are two excellent replicas of a statue of Athena,
of the time of Phidias.—Adjoining the court, on the right, is the so-called
Prætorium of Pilate, and straight in front are the Vestibule, with its
superb azulejos, and the Chapel, with its charming Gothic-Moorish decoration.
To the left of the vestibule is a room with azulejos and a rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>artesonado ceiling.—A magnificent staircase, roofed by a much admired
dome, ascends to the upper floor, which is not accessible.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Plaza de Pilatos we follow the Calle de Caballerizas
and Calle Descalzos to the N.W. to the pretty Plaza de Argüelles (Pl.
D, 2, 3). Here rises <i>San Pedro</i>, a Gothic church of the 14th cent.,
containing a fine timber ceiling and pictures by Pedro Campaña
and Roelas (sacristan, Calle Doña María Coronel 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>Following the Calle de la Imagen, and crossing the <i>Mercado</i>
(Pl. D, 3), we reach the Calle Laraña.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>University</b> (Pl. D, 3) now occupies an old Jesuit convent.
The <i>University Church</i> (entered from the quadrangle; fee ½–1 p.),
built in 1565–79 by Bartolomé Bustamante (?) for the Jesuits, in
the Renaissance style, contains fine Renaissance monuments and
several sculptures and paintings by Montañés, Alonso Cano, Roelas,
and others.</p>

<p class='c016'>The churches in the <span class='sc'>N.E. Quarter</span>, such as <i>Omnium Sanctorum</i>
(Pl. B, 3), <i>San Marcos</i> (Pl. C, 2), and <i>Santa Marina</i> (Pl. B, 2) still possess
towers in the Moorish style, which were once the minarets of mosques.—The
so-called <i>Casa del Duque de Alba</i> (Pl. C, 2), Calle de las Dueñas 5,
a palace built for the Riberas (p. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>) in the Mudejar style after 1483,
contains a court planted with palms and a staircase richly adorned with
azulejos, but the house itself is not shown.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the Calle de Santa Paula, a little to the E. of San Marcos, is the
<i>Convento de Santa Paula</i> (Pl. C, 1, 2), a nunnery founded in 1476. The
forecourt has a superb Gothic portal, with terracotta ornamentation by
Franc. Nicoluso of Pisa and reliefs of saints by Pedro Millán (p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>).
The rich mural azulejos (16th cent.) in the church’ are well worth seeing.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the Ronda de Capuchinos (Pl. A, 1, 2) there are considerable remains
of the ancient <i>City Wall</i>, with its external towers and low parapet
(‘barbacana’, after Byzantine models).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>c. The Western and South-Western Quarters.</h4>

<p class='c021'>Starting from the small <span class='sc'>Plaza del Pacífico</span> (Pl. D, 4), planted
with orange-trees, we follow the Calle de San Pablo to the S.W.
as far as the church of <i>Santa Magdalena</i> (Pl. D, 4) and then turn
to the right into the Calle de Bailén. From this in turn we again
diverge to the right and follow the Calle de Miguel de Carvajal to
the <span class='sc'>Plaza del Museo</span> (Pl. D, 5; officially, Plaza de la Condesa de
Casa Galindo), in which rises a <i>Bronze Statue of Murillo</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Museo Provincial</b> (Pl. D, 5; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>), occupying
an old monastery of Mercenarii (<i>Convento de la Merced</i>),
contains the small <i>Museo Arqueológico</i> and the <i>Museo de Pinturas</i>,
a famous picture-gallery. The gallery contains several valuable
sculptures, but its chief treasure consists in 23 <i>Murillos</i>, mostly
from the old Capuchin monastery (Pl. A, B, 1), depicting the legend
of St. Francis of Assisi and the foundation of the Franciscan order.</p>

<p class='c016'>A small court leads to the <span class='sc'>N. Cloisters</span>, where the antiques (Roman,
Visigothic, Moorish), along with some modern works, are exhibited. From
the nearer aisle of the cloisters an azulejos-portal leads straight into the—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><span class='sc'>Great Hall</span> of the picture-gallery, once the convent-church. The
**<i>Murillos</i> are all hung on the walls of the nave. On the S. wall, by
the entrance, note specially the Concepción, the Annunciation, SS. Leander
and Bonaventura, and the ‘Virgen de la Servilleta’, said to have been
painted on a table-napkin. On the N. wall we note St. Felix of Cantalicio
with the Infant Jesus, the *Almsgiving of St. Thomas of Villanueva,
the great Conception, the Adoration or the Shepherds, and Christ on the
Cross embracing St. Francis.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the end-wall of the church is the Martyrdom of St. Andrew by
<i>Roelas</i>. The transept and choir are hung with numerous pictures by
<i>Zurbarán</i> (notably the Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas, in the choir).
Here, too, are several *Sculptures: <i>Pietro Torrigiani</i>, Virgin and Child,
with the penitent St. Jerome (in terracotta); <i>Montañés</i>, wooden figures
of the Virgin and Child, John the Baptist, and St. Dominicus.</p>

<p class='c022'>A room on the <span class='sc'>Upper Floor</span> contains modern pictures.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Calle de los Reyes Católicos, in line with the Calle de San
Pablo (p. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>), ends at the Puente de Isabel Segunda (Pl. F, 6), the
chief bridge crossing to the suburb of <i>Triana</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little short of the bridge we turn to the left and follow the
<span class='sc'>Paseo de Cristóbal Colón</span> (Pl. E, F, 5, 4), skirting the left bank
of the Guadalquivir and the quays. On the left lie the <i>Bull Ring</i>
(Pl. F, 4, 5); then the pretty <span class='sc'>Plaza de Atarazanas</span> (Pl. F, 4;
Arabic Dâr as-San῾a, ‘arsenal’, ‘place of work’), on the site of the
old Moorish wharf, where the great <i>Artillery Arsenal</i> (Maestranza),
the Hospital de la Caridad, and the <i>Custom House</i> (Aduana), are
now situated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Hospital de la Caridad</b> (Pl. F, 4; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>),
erected for the ‘brotherhood of charity’ (Hermandad de la Caridad)
in 1661–4, possesses, in its baroque church, six far-famed **<i>Murillos</i>
(1660–74). Two of these in particular are the delight and
admiration of every beholder: Moses striking the Rock (Cuadro de
las Aguas, or La Sed, ‘the thirst’) and the Feeding of the Five
Thousand (Pan y Peces, ‘bread and fishes’). Besides these pictures
there are, on the left, the Infant Christ, the Annunciation, and San
Juan de Dios carrying sick persons into the hospital; on the right,
the young John the Baptist. By tho high-choir are two singular but
repulsive pictures by <i>Juan Valdés Leal</i> (1630–91), the Raising of
the Cross and the Triumph of Death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the S. angle of the Plaza, close to the river, rises the
<b>Torre del Oro</b> (Pl. G, 4), once a fortified tower of the Moorish
Alcázar (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>), and ever since called the ‘tower of gold’ on account
of its brilliant azulejos. The upper part of the tower dates
from the Christian period only; the window openings and the balconies
were constructed in 1760.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the Torre del Oro begin the *<b>Public Gardens</b> of Seville,
which, particularly in spring, when roses, camellias, and orange-blossom
are in their glory, afford a delightful promenade. The
favourite part is the <i>Paseo de las Delicias</i> (Pl. H, 3), beginning
at the <i>Palacio de Santelmo</i> (Pl. G, 3; now a priests’ seminary),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>where the people of fashion drive on fine afternoons. On the way
back we may walk through the <i>Parque María Luisa</i> (Pl. H, 2),
once part of the Santelmo gardens, and regain the town by the
Calle San Fernando, passing the great <i>Tobacco Factory</i> (Pl. G, 3),
a huge baroque building of 1757.</p>

down to the <i>Guadalquivir</i>. The town, whose ancient glory has long
departed, now contains little or nothing to interest the expectant
traveller except the mosque, now the Cathedral, which in spite of
many later additions and disfigurements, is still the grandest monument
in Spain of the Moorish period. Other memorials of this
Mecca of the Occident, once famous as a patroness of science also,
now survive only in several portals and inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><i>Corduba</i>, the most important of the ancient Iberian towns on the
upper course of the Bætis, became a Roman colony in 152 B.C., and was
noted for its commerce and its wealth. The Visigothic king <i>Leovigild</i>
wrested it in 571 from the Byzantines and made it an episcopal see.
After the decisive battle of 711 (p. <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>) Cordova was captured by the
Moors, aided by the Jews who were alienated by the arrogance of the
Visigoths. With the Moorish sway begins the world-wide fame of the
city, especially from the time when the emir <i>Abderrahmân I.</i>, of the
house of the <i>Omaiyades</i> (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>), on his escape from the massacre of
his family at Damascus, settled at Cordova in 756 and declared his independence
of the Oriental caliphate. As the capital of the Spanish or
western caliphate, Cordova soon became the wealthiest city in Spain, and
even for a short time the richest in Europe, notably under <i>Abderrahmân II.</i>
(822–52) and <i>Abderrahmân III.</i> (912–61), the greatest of the Omaiyades,
and also under the governor (hâjib) <i>Al-Mansûr</i> (d. 1002). It even rivalled
Bagdad and Fez as a brilliant centre of Mohammedan culture, to which
students flocked from every part of the Occident. At length, after the
<i>Almoravides</i> and <i>Almohades</i> (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), who had been summoned to aid the
citizens against the Christians, had vainly attempted to arrest the decay
of the city, Cordova fell, in 1236, into the hands of <i>Ferdinand III. of
Castile</i>, who expelled the Moorish inhabitants and in 1248 made Seville
his residence. The city afterwards fell into decay and poverty, and the
once highly extolled Campiña became a desolate wilderness.</p>

<p class='c022'>See ‘Cordova’, by <i>A. F. Calvert</i> and <i>W. M. Gallichan</i> (London, 1907).</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Carrera de la Estación, or ‘station street’, bearing a
little to the left, we enter the <i>Paseo del Gran Capitán</i> (Pl. C, 1, 2),
the favourite promenade of the townsfolk on summer evenings.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S. end of the Paseo, near the church of <i>San Nicolás de
la Villa</i> (Pl. C, 2), with its octagonal tower, once a minaret, we
take the Calle del Conde de Gondomar to the left, and then, just
short of the Hotel Suizo, follow the Calle de Jesús María (Pl. C,
2, 3) to the right. This street, continued by the Calle de Angel
de Saavedra, the Calle Pedregosa, and the Calle Céspedes, leads to
the S. to the cathedral.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. C, 3, 4; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>), once the
<i>Mesjid al-Jâmia</i>, or ‘chief mosque’ of the city, one of the greatest
in the world, and still called <i>La Mezquita</i>, is the grandest and
noblest creation of Moorish architecture in Spain. The mosque
was founded by Abderrahmân I. in 785, on the site of a Christian
church, and was intended to form a great religious centre for all
believers in Spain, and to induce the great stream of western
pilgrims to repair to Cordova instead of to Mecca. A model for
the edifice was found in the arcaded courts and colonnaded halls
of the Egyptian mosques (such as the Amru Mosque, p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>). The
original edifice contained only ten rows of columns, which formed
eleven longitudinal and twelve transverse aisles. The central aisle
was a little wider than the others and ended in a Mihrâb, or prayer-recess,
designed to mark the direction of Mecca (Kibla). As the building
soon proved inadequate for the population, which was rapidly
increased by accessions from the East, Abderrahmân II., in 833–48,
added seven transepts on the S. side and erected a new mihrâb.
A further prolongation by fourteen transepts was effected by AlHâkim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>II. (961–76), after which the magnificent third mihrâb
(mihrâb nuevo) formed the termination of the building. Though
the mosque was now considered the finest in the Occident, rivalling
the Kairuin mosque at Fez, it failed to satisfy the ambition of
Al-Mansûr (p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>). As the sloping ground on the S. side precluded
extension in that direction, this governor, in 987–90, caused seven
new rows of columns to be raised on the E. side, thus increasing
the number of aisles to nineteen, but destroying the symmetrical
plan of the building, which required the mihrâb, or holy of holies,
to be in line with the main axis of the building.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the conquest of Cordova by the Christians in 1236 (p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>)
the mosque was dedicated to the Virgin (Virgen de la Asunción). The
Spaniards at first confined their operations to walling up most of
the doors and then fitting up side-chapels along the walls. As the
needs of the Christian ritual, however, soon demanded the construction
of a choir (primitivo coro), part of the second mihrâb
and the adjoining aisles had in 1260 to be demolished. Still
greater damage was done by the insertion of the Renaissance choir
in the centre of the building, and of the Sala Capitular, or sacristy,
in the middle of the S. wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Ground Plan</span> forms an immense rectangle of about 575
by 427 ft., of which fully a third is occupied by the court. Court
and church are surrounded by a fortress-like battlemented wall
which, on three sides, rests on massive substructions. Nothing
indicates the object of the building except the rich portals, flanked
with niches and windows, and, on the N. side, adjoining the Calle
del Obispo Herrero, the <i>Campanario</i> or bell-tower (305 ft. high),
which was substituted for the Moorish minaret in 1593. Ascent of
the tower interesting (adm. 25 c.; 255 steps).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Puerta del Perdón</i>, the main gateway, restored in 1377
on the model of the gate of that name at Seville (p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>), adjoins
the clock-tower and leads into the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<i>Patio de los Naranjos</i> (‘orange-court’), once the court of the
mosque, where the faithful performed their ablutions. Light and
spacious, yet well-shaded by orange and palm-trees, watered by
five fountains, and always enlivened with groups of quiet visitors,
it presents a typical scene of Oriental repose. The avenues were
originally laid out in line with the colonnades in the interior of the
mosque. The old arcades of the court (claustro) are now walled
up on the N. side. Of the nineteen gates on the S. side, two only,
the <i>Puerta de las Palmas</i>, the chief entrance to the cathedral, and
the small doorway of the eastmost colonnade are now open.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Interior of the Cathedral</span>, in spite of its moderate
height (37 ft.), and in spite of much disfigurement, is singularly
impressive. In the subdued light the forest of columns seems endless.
They average 13 ft. only in height, and are of the most diverse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>materials, many of them having been brought from late-Roman
buildings or from Christian churches. The capitals show a marvellous
wealth of design; their bases are buried in the pavement,
the level of which has been raised by 11–14 inches in the course
of centuries. The vast number of horseshoe arches which connect
the columns, in the direction of the length of the church, and the
upper semicircular arches resting on projecting pillars impart
peculiar life to the building. The painted timber-ceilings of the
different roofs have been restored in their original style. The
sumptuous mosaic pavement has disappeared, and so too have the
countless chandeliers and lamps which burned perpetually during
the Moorish period.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wealth of artistic decoration was lavished chiefly on the
mihrâbs, the first of which has been entirely destroyed. The
second and third were each provided with a vestibule and two
side-rooms, part of which was formerly shut off to form the
Caliph’s maksûra (or court-platform). The vestibule of the *Second
Mihrâb, with its superb shell-vaulting, still exists.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<span class='sc'>Third Mihrâb</span> is considered a marvel of art. The front
is adorned with two rows of columns, one above the other, and
with double toothed arches. The vestibule, now Capilla de San
Pedro, and the prayer-niche itself, a kind of heptagonal chapel of
barely 13 ft. in diameter, exhibit the most elaborate efforts of
early-Moorish art, especially in the rich marble plinth and in the
coloured glass mosaics executed by Byzantine artists. The toothed
arches of the windows and the boldly interlacing arches of the
superb dome point to a later high development of Moorish art.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the <span class='sc'>Christian Additions</span> to the church one of the most
noteworthy is the sumptuous <i>Capilla Mudéjar de San Fernando</i>,
to the left of the second mihrâb, erected over the old royal vault.
The *<i>Renaissance Choir</i> (Coro and Capilla Mayor), designed by
<i>Hernán Ruiz the Elder</i> in 1523, was completed, with many
alterations, in 1627. Though only 256 by 79 ft. in size, it is
crowded with no less than 63 columns, and it rises high above the
roof of the mosque. It is considered a masterpiece of the plateresque
style, but has ruined the original symmetry of the mosque.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Alcázar</b> (Pl. C, 4; now a prison), erected in 1328, contains
but scanty relics of the ancient Moorish castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Calle Torrijos, on the W. side of the cathedral, descends
to the <i>Puerta del Puente</i>, a triumphal arch of the time of Philip II.,
on the site of the Moorish bridge gateway. The Moorish *<b>Bridge</b>
(Pl. C, D, 4) of sixteen arches, resting on Roman foundations, here
unites Cordova with the S. suburb of <i>Campo de la Verdad</i>.
Halfway across we have a fine view of the cathedral, and of a dam,
up the river, with Moorish mills. The massive tête-de-pont, <i>Calahorra</i>
(Iberian <i>Calagurris</i>), also is of Moorish origin.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Returning into the town from the bridge, we may next visit
the <i>Puerta Almodóvar</i> (Pl. B, 3), a relic of the Moorish city-wall,
and then walk through the <i>Jardines de la Victoria</i> to the station.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Granáda</i> (2195 ft.; pop. 69,000), once the capital of the Moorish
kingdom, and now that of the province of Granada, the residence
of an archbishop and seat of a university, lies most picturesquely at
the foot of two hills (about 490 ft. high), which gradually slope to
the E. up to the <i>Cerro del Sol</i>, and descend abruptly to the fertile,
well-watered river-plain of the <i>Vega</i>. The <i>Albaicín</i>, the northmost
of the two hills, the oldest quarter of Granada, once the
residence of the Moorish aristocracy, but now inhabited chiefly by
gipsies, forms a town by itself. The deep ravine of the <i>Darro</i>,
which is generally dry as its water is much diverted for irrigation
purposes, separates the Albaicín from the <i>Monte de la Assabica</i>,
or Alhambra Hill to the S. (comp. p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>). The Darro, descending
from the N.E., turns to the S. near the Alhambra Hill and falls into
the more important <i>Genil</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two hills were once occupied by Iberian and then by
Roman settlements, the one on the Albaicín having perhaps already
borne the name of <i>Garnata</i>. Soon after 711 the Moors built the
‘Old Castle’ (Al-Kasaba al-Kadîma) on the site of Garnata. After
the decline of the caliphate of Cordova (p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>) <i>Zâwi ibn Zîri</i>,
the governor of Granada, declared himself independent in 1031,
and founded here the dynasty of the <i>Zirites</i>, which, however, was
overthrown by the Almoravides (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) in 1090. As the power of
the Almohades (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) declined the native governors revolted anew.
At length in 1246 Granada became the seat of the <i>Nasride
Dynasty</i> founded by <i>Al-Ahmar</i> (‘<i>Mohammed I.</i>‘), which, after
the fall of Seville, succeeded, in alliance alternately with the Castilians
and the Merinides (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), in retaining possession of Granada,
Málaga, and Almería for nearly 250 years. Mohammed I. offered
an asylum in Granada to the Moors who were expelled from Cordova,
Valencia, and Seville, and began the building of the ‘New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Castle’ (Al-Kasaba al-Jedîda) on the hill of the Alhambra. His
successors afterwards created the Alhambra Palace, the most
sumptuous of royal residences. Thanks to their fostering care for
agriculture and industry, for science, art and architecture, Granada
attained such brilliant prosperity as even to eclipse the fame of
the old caliphate of Cordova.</p>

<p class='c011'>The downfall of the kingdom of Granada was at length brought
about by party struggles between the <i>Zegri</i>, the <i>Beni Serrâj</i> (the
<i>Abencerrages</i> of legend; comp. p. <a href='#Page_84'>84</a>), and other noble families, and
by quarrels between king <i>Mulei Abu’l-Hasan</i> (d. 1485) and his son
<i>Boabdil</i>; a welcome opportunity was thus afforded to Ferdinand and
Isabella, the so-called ‘Catholic Kings’, of intervening and thus gaining
their life-long object of destroying the last Moorish kingdom
in Spain. After the death of his father Boabdil remained inactive
when Ferdinand proceeded to besiege Málaga (p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>); he made one
despairing attempt at resistance when the Spaniards demanded the
evacuation of Granada, but in 1491 had to conclude a humiliating
peace. He soon afterwards crossed the Sierra Nevada and retired
to Tlemcen in N. Africa (p. <a href='#Page_187'>187</a>), where he ended his inglorious
career. With the Spanish domination began the decay of the city;
it was depopulated by the decrees of the Catholic Kings, the Inquisition
held fearful sway here, and ere long Granada became a
‘living ruin’. Within the last few years, however, the busy tourist
traffic, the establishment of sugar-factories, and the prosperous
mining industry of the Sierra Nevada have somewhat repaired the
fortunes of the city, and several of the old quarters have been
entirely modernized. But its picturesque history, its memorials
of the most glorious period of Moorish culture and art, and the
striking view of the snow-mountains it affords will ever render it
the most fascinating goal of travellers in Andalusia.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. The Lower Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>Leaving the railway-station (Pl. B, 6; tramway No. 1, see p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>),
we follow the Calle Real de San Lázaro to the S.E. to the <i>Paseo del
Triunfo</i> (Pl. C, 4), so named from the column in honour of the Virgin
(triunfo). Here, by the half-ruined <i>Puerta de Elvira</i> (Pl. C, 4),
begin the old Calle de Elvira and the new <span class='sc'>Gran Via de Colón</span> (Pl.
C-E, 4), both leading to the chief artery of traffic, the narrow—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Calle de los Reyes Católicos</span> (Pl. E, 4, 5), which is built
above the Darro, and connects the busy Puerta Real (Pl. E, 5), to the
S.W., with the Plaza Nueva (Pl. E, 4; officially, Plaza Rodriguez
Bolivar), to the N.E., at the foot of the Alhambra Hill (p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>In the Calle de Lopez Rubio, a side-street, is the so-called <i>Casa
del Carbón</i>, once a Moorish granary, with picturesque horseshoe
arches and stalactite vaulting. To the S.W. of it is the modern
town-hall (<i>Ayuntamiento</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The short streets on the opposite side lead to the <i>Alcaicería</i>,
(Pl. E, 4, 5), with its numerous columns, which was burned down
in 1843, once a Moorish market-hall (Al-Kaisariya), resembling the
Oriental sûks (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>), and to the modernized <i>Plaza de Bibarrambla</i>
(Pl. E, 5), named after a Moorish city-gate which once stood here.
A few paces from these lies the <span class='sc'>Placeta de las Pasiegas</span>. Here,
surrounded by buildings which mar its effect, rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. D, E, 4, 5), an imposing memorial of the conquest
of Spain, and the finest Renaissance church in the kingdom.
It was begun in 1523 by <i>Enrique de Egas</i> in the Gothic style,
continued in 1525 by <i>Diego de Siloe</i> (d. 1533) in the plateresque
style (p. <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>), and consecrated, while still unfinished, in 1561. The
N. tower only, which is now 187 ft. high, has been erected; the huge
façade was begun in 1667 by <i>Alonso Cano</i>, who was also the chief
author of the sculpture and painting in the church; the interior
was not completed till 1703.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two of the <span class='sc'>Side Portals</span>, the Puerta de San Jerónimo, the first
entrance to the N. in the Calle de Jiménez de Cisneros, and the Puerta
del Colegio, on the E. side of the ambulatory, are adorned with sculptures
by <i>Siloe</i> and others. The *Puerta del Perdón, the second portal to the N.,
also owes the beautiful ornamentation of its lower part to <i>Siloe</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<span class='sc'>Interior</span> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>) has double aisles with two rows of
chapels, a lofty transept which does not project beyond the side-walls,
a central choir, and a Capilla Mayor with ambulatory. The vaulting, 100 ft.
in height, is borne by massive pillars and half-columns. Total length 380,
breadth 220 ft. The decoration in white and gold harmonizes well with
the fine marble pavement (1775).</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<span class='sc'>Capilla Mayor</span>, 148 ft. long and 154 ft. high, is crowned with
a dome resting on Corinthian columns. On the pillars in front of the
marble high-altar are kneeling statues of the ‘Catholic Kings’, by <i>Pedro
de Mena</i> and <i>Medrano</i> (1677); above them are painted *Busts of Adam
and Eve, in oak, by <i>Alonso Cano</i>, who painted also the representation of
the Seven Joys of Mary.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Side Chapels.</span> The Capilla de San Miguel, on the right, lavishly
decorated in 1807, contains a picture by <i>Al. Cano</i>, the Mater Dolorosa
(after Gasp. Becerra).—In the Capilla de la Trinidad, beyond the door of
the Sagrario (p. <a href='#Page_77'>77</a>), is a painting of the Trinity by <i>Al. Cano</i>.—The Altar
de Jesús Nazareno contains *Pictures by <i>Dom. Theotocópuli</i> (St. Francis)
and <i>Ribera</i>; the fine Bearing of the Cross is by <i>Al. Cano</i>.—By the same
artist are also the fine oaken busts of St. Paul and John the Baptist in
the Capilla de Nuestra Señora del Carmen, adjoining the N. aisles.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the first chapel in the ambulatory, to the right of the Puerta
del Colegio, a portal by <i>Siloe</i> leads through an ante-room (antesacristía)
into the <span class='sc'>Sacristy</span> (18th cent.), containing a crucifix by Montañés (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>)
and an Annunciation and a Conception (a sculpture) by <i>Al. Cano</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>A handsome portal leads from the right transept into the late-Gothic
*<b>Capilla Real</b>, the burial-chapel of the ‘Catholic Kings’, where Charles V.
caused his parents Philip of Austria and Juana the Insane also to be interred.
The marble *Monuments are in the Italian early-Renaissance style:
on the right those of Ferdinand and Isabella, by the Florentine <i>Domenico
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Fancelli</i>; on the left, Philip and Juana, by <i>Bartolomé Ordóñez</i>. The high-altar,
with the kneeling statuettes of the ‘Catholic Kings’, is by <i>Philip
Vigarní</i>, a Burgundian; the reliefs in wood, historically interesting, represent
(left) the surrender of the Alhambra keys and (right) the compulsory
baptism of the Moors. Behind the reliquary altars, which are
opened on four festival-days only, are hung Madonnas by <i>Dierick Bouts</i>,
altar-wings by <i>Roger van der Weyden</i>, a Madonna and a Descent from
the Cross by <i>Memling</i>, and other pictures. Over an altar in the right
aisle is a *Winged Picture by <i>D. Bouts</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>The third great addition to the cathedral, the <b>Sagrario</b>, erected as
a parish church in 1705–59, occupies the site of the ancient mosque, with
its eleven aisles, which was used for Christian worship down to 1661.</p>

<p class='c009'>The picturesque <span class='sc'>Placeta de la Lonja</span> (Pl. E, 4), on the S. side
of the cathedral, affords a good view of the <i>Lonja</i> (Exchange),
built in 1518–22, which stands before the Sagrario, of the rich
architecture of the Capilla Real, and of the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Casa del Cabildo Antigua</b>, once the seat of the Moorish
university founded here after the downfall of Cordova and Seville,
afterwards the residence of the ‘Catholic Kings’, and now a cloth
magazine. Its fantastic exterior dates from the 18th cent.; in the
interior are two interesting rooms of the Moorish period (fee 50 c.).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>From the E. end of the Calle de los Reyes Católicos (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>) the
Calle Castro y Serrano and Calle Doctor Eximio lead to the right
to the <i>Casa de los Tiros</i> (Pl. E, 4), a building in the Moorish
castellated style, dating from the 15th cent., and now owned by
the Marquesa de Campotéjar. The court contains a venerable tree-like
vine. Tickets for the Generalife (comp. p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>) are issued here.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Calle de Santa Escolástica leads hence to the Plaza de
Santo Domingo (Pl. F, 4) and the old monastery of <i>Santo Domingo</i>
(now a military school), with its pleasing church (15–17th cent.).—A
little to the S.W. is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cuarto Real de Santa Domingo</i> (Pl. F, 4; admittance seldom
granted), the Al-Majarra of the Moors, now named after a tower
of the 13th cent., a superb villa with a Moorish portal and a hall
whose charming decoration is older than the Alhambra. The
beautiful garden is said to have been laid out in Moorish times.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now cross the Plaza Bailén to the N.W. to the favourite
winter promenade (p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>), the <i>Carrera del Genil</i> (Pl. E-G, 5), shaded
with plane-trees, which begins at the Puerta Real (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>) and now
comprises the former <i>Alameda</i>. Adjoining the Carrera on the left
is the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Paseo del Salón</b> (Pl. G, 5, 4). planted with elms and
adorned with a bronze statue of <i>Isabella the Catholic</i>. Delightful
view to the N.E. of Monte Mauror with the Torres Bermejas (p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>);
to the S.E. towers the majestic Sierra Nevada, from whose rocky
crest the <i>Picacho de la Veleta</i> (11,148 ft.), the grandest point of
view in all Andalusia, alone rises conspicuously.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h4 class='c023'>b. Darro Valley and Albaicín.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'>At the mouth of the Darro Valley lies the <span class='sc'>Plaza Nueva</span> (Pl.
E, 4; p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>), another focus of traffic (tramways, see p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>). On the
left is the <i>Audiencia</i>, formerly the Chancilleria, built in 1531–87
for the Capitán General or governor. The pretty arcaded court
was probably designed by Diego de Siloe (p. <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces farther to the E. the Darro is not covered in.
Here, on the right, on the site of an old mosque, is the church of
<b>Santa Ana</b> (Pl. E, 3), a Renaissance building, perhaps designed
by <i>Diego de Siloe</i> in 1541, with a fine plateresque portal and an
admirable timber ceiling. The tower, built by <i>Juan Castellar</i> in
1561–3, with its azulejos and jutting roof resting on corbels,
resembles a minaret.</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite the church, on the right bank of the Darro, begins
the <span class='sc'>Carrera del Darro</span> (Pl. E, 3, 2), one of the oldest parts of
Granada, affording picturesque views, notably of the towers and
walls of the Alhambra, which had its oldest approach from this
quarter. (Part of a horseshoe arch of the bridge is seen on the
left bank.) The <i>Bañuelo</i>, at No. 37, now occupied by poor families,
is a Moorish bath, dating perhaps from the 11th century.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the right side of the street we come to the church of <i>San
Pedro y San Pablo</i> (Pl. E, 3, 2), with its fine timber ceiling. On
the opposite bank of the Darro we observe traces of the landslip
under the N.E. corner of the Alcazaba (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>), below which are
the arches of an aqueduct. To the N. of the church is the <i>Casa de
Castril</i>, a curious Renaissance building with an ornate portal by
a pupil of Siloe.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next reach the <span class='sc'>Alameda del Darro</span> (Pl. E, 2), planted
with elms; above us, on the right, is the Generalife (p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>); on the
left, Albaicín (p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>). Crossing the bridge to the right we enter
the steep <span class='sc'>Cuesta del Rey Chico</span> (Pl. F, 2), which leads through
the ravine mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>, and past the Moorish towers of the
Alhambra, to the <i>Puerta de Hierro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>), the E. gate of the
Alhambra, and to the <i>Generalife</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Darro the <span class='sc'>Cuesta del Chapiz</span> (Pl. E, D, 2) ascends
to the N. to the old suburb of <i>Albaida</i>. The street is named after
the <i>Casa del Chapiz</i>, erected early in the 16th cent. in the Mudejar
style for two Morisco nobles, with two separate patios. The house,
now a bakery, is entered from No. 14, at the corner of the Camino
del Sacro Monte.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this point the <span class='sc'>Camino del Sacro Monte</span> (Pl. D, 2, 1)
ascends the cactus-grown slope. The numerous poor <i>Cuevas</i>, or cave-dwellings,
are chiefly occupied by gipsies (gitanos). The path ends
at the (25 min.) <b>Sacro Monte</b> (to the N.E. of Pl. D, E, 1), a Benedictine
monastery of the 17th cent., now a divinity and law school.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>The view of the Alhambra across the Darro valley, of the town and
the Vega, is one of the finest near Granada.</p>

<p class='c011'>Footpaths ascend from the Cuesta del Chapiz in 25 min., and
from the Sacro Monte in ¾ hr., partly through deep gorges, to the
chapel of <b>San Miguel el Alto</b> (Pl. D, 1), in the midst of aloes
and cacti, where we enjoy a grand *View of the Alhambra, the town,
the Vega, and the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The side-streets of the Carrera del Darro (p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>) ascend to the N.
to <b>Albaicín</b>, a poor suburb (p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>). Not far from San Pedro y San
Pablo (p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>) is the small Gothic church of <i>San Juan de los
Reyes</i> (Pl. D, 2), an early 16th cent. edifice, whose tower was once
a minaret.</p>

<p class='c011'>Above this church, and of like date, is the Gothic church of
<b>San Nicolás</b> (Pl. D, 2), also built on Moorish foundations, and
containing a fine timber ceiling. The famous *View of the Alhambra
and the Sierra Nevada is a favourite subject with artists. The
<i>Puerta de los Estandartes</i> (Pl. D, 3), close by, is a relic of the
Moorish <i>Castle Wall</i>, which runs down hence to the <i>Puerta Monáita</i>
(Pl. C, 3, 4). On the N. side the Cuesta de la Alacaba (Pl. D,
C, 3, 4) descends to the Paseo del Triunfo (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the way back to the Plaza Nueva we pass the Franciscan
nunnery of <i>Santa Isabel la Real</i> (Pl. D, 3), whose church has a
tasteful late-Gothic portal by Enrique de Egas.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>c. The Alhambra.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The <b>Alhambra</b> occupies the plateau, 795 by 195 yds., of the
<i>Monte de la Assabica</i> (p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>), which rises abruptly from the Darro
on the N. side, while on the S. it is separated by a gorge, the <i>Assabica</i>
of the Moors, from the lower spur of the <i>Monte Mauror</i>
(Pl. F, 3; p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>). The axis of this range of hills is abruptly
intersected by a second gorge, the <i>Cuesta del Rey Chico</i> (p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>),
separating it on the E. side from the <i>Cerro del Sol</i> (p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>), at the
foot of which lies the Generalife (p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>). On the narrow W. point
of the plateau stands the castle of <i>Alcazaba</i>. Beyond the small
glacis on its E. side, and beyond the Plaza de los Aljibes, rises the
<i>Alhambra</i> itself, adjoining which, on the S.E., lies the <i>Alta Alhambra</i>,
once quite a little town, where the retinue and servants
of the court resided. The whole of these buildings, enclosed by a
wall with numerous towers, were called by the Moors <i>Medînat al-Hamrâ</i>,
literally ‘red city’, from the colour of its stone.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>History</span> of the Alhambra begins with Mohammed I. (1232–72),
the first Nasride sovereign. While the Zirites resided on the Albaicín
hill (comp. p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>), Mohammed chose the Alhambra Hill as a site for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>palace. The building was continued by his son <i>Mohammed II.</i> (1272–1302),
and the Alhambra mosque (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>) was erected by <i>Mohammed III.</i> (1302–9).
<i>Abu’l-Walîd Ismaîl</i> (1309–25) was the first to erect a small palace outside
of the Alcazaba, but this, with the exception of the Patio del Mexuar
(p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>), was taken down by <i>Yûsuf I.</i> (1333–54). Yûsuf began the stately
Comares or myrtle-court palace, with its throne and audience room; to
him are ascribed also the Comares tower (p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>), the baths (p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>), and the
enclosing wall of the Alhambra Hill, with 23 additional towers. For the
more sumptuous part of the pile <i>Mohammed V.</i> (1354–91) was chiefly
responsible. To him was due the completion of the Myrtle Court, the erection
of the Cuarto de Machuca, the summer abode of part of the family,
and of the luxurious lion-court palace, the winter dwelling of the court
and of the sovereign’s harem. The last Moorish king who made additions
to the Alhambra was <i>Mohammed VII.</i> (1392–1408).</p>

<p class='c022'>The ‘Catholic Kings’, as Ferdinand and Isabella are styled, took a
great interest in the Alhambra; they restored the decorations of the interior
and strengthened the walls. Charles V. visited Granada in 1526, but with
less satisfactory results. Although an enthusiastic admirer of Moorish art,
he caused many outbuildings of the Alhambra to be removed to make
way for his new palace (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>). At length, after 1718, when Philip V.
discontinued the payment of money for the upkeep of the buildings, they
rapidly fell into decay, and in 1812 the French, on their retreat, blew up
several of the towers. Since 1830, however, the work of restoration,
though sometimes in doubtful taste, has been resumed.</p>

<p class='c022'>It is hardly necessary to remind our readers of <i>Washington Irving’s</i>
delightful ‘Tales of the Alhambra’, which were partly written on the
spot. A series of magnificent views of the Alhambra is given in the
monumental work of <i>Jules Goury</i> and <i>Owen Jones</i>, published at London
in 1842. See also ‘The Alhambra’ by <i>A. F. Calvert</i> (2nd ed., London, 1907).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Hill Tramway</span> (rack-and-pinion; p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>) ascends from the
Puerta de los Molinos (Pl. G, 3) on the S. slope of <i>Monte Mauror</i>,
affording a splendid view of Granada, the Vega, and the Sierra
Nevada on the left, to the Cuesta de las Cruces (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>) in the Alhambra
Park, a few minutes’ walk from the entrance of the Alhambra.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shortest <span class='sc'>Road</span> to the Alhambra is the Calle de Gomeres
(Pl. E, 4, 3), which ascends steeply from the Plaza Nueva to the
S.E., between the hills of the Alcazaba and the Torres Bermejas,
to the Puerta de las Granadas, the present chief entrance to the
Alhambra Park.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Puerta de las Granadas</b> (Pl. 1; E, 3), erected by <i>Pedro
Machuca</i> (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>), in the form of a triumphal arch, on the site of
the Moorish <i>Bîb Alaujar</i>, occupied the centre of the wall connecting
the Alcazaba with the <span class='sc'>Torres Bermejas</span>, the fortifications on the W.
point of the Monte Mauror, which were built at the same period
as the Alcazaba, but have been frequently restored.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<span class='sc'>Torres Bermejas</span> (Pl. F, 3; ‘red towers’), now a military prison,
deserve a visit, which may be best paid on the way back from the Alhambra
or the Generalife. The path diverges from the Cuesta de las Cruces
(p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>) a few paces to the E. of the Puerta de las Granadas. Adm. on
application at the guard-house. The extensive buildings, with their underground
stabling, the cistern, and the casemates, convey an excellent idea
of an ancient Moorish fortress. Stairs, rather steep, ascend to the platform
(<i>azotea</i>) on the chief tower, where we obtain a most picturesque view.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<b>Alhambra Park</b> (<i>Alameda de la Alhambra</i>; Pl. F, 3, 2),
a ‘sacred grove’ unique of its kind, occupies the Assabica Valley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>(p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>), reaching far up its slopes. It was planted at the end of the
18th cent. with elms exclusively, placed so close together as to form
one dense roof of leafage, the home of countless nightingales. In
March, when the sun shines through the leafless branches, the soil
is temporarily covered with rich vegetation.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Puerta de las Granadas three roads ascend to the
Alhambra. To the right is the <span class='sc'>Cuesta de las Cruces</span>, leading up
the S. side of the park to the hill-tramway and the <i>Alhambra Hotels</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>); to the left is the rather fatiguing <span class='sc'>Cuesta Empedrada</span>, the
old route to the castle, ending at the <i>Puerta Judiciaria</i> (see below);
between these is the easy <span class='sc'>Main Road</span>, passing three fountains, and
also leading to the hotels, but connected by side-paths with the
Puerta Judiciaria. Carriages use this road and pass through the
<i>Puerta del Carril</i> (Pl. 6; F, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The entrance-tower, with the *<b>Puerta Judiciaria</b> (Pl. 5; E,
F, 3), which, according to the inscription, was erected in the reign
of Yûsuf I. in 1348, and was called by the Moors <i>Bîbush-Sheria</i>
(‘gate of justice’), deserves special attention. Like many of the
Alhambra towers, this was really an independent building, the road
between the gates of which was made tortuous for defensive purposes.
About halfway up is the horseshoe-shaped <i>Outer Gate</i>, above
which is seen a hand with outstretched fingers, a symbol often used
in the East and in S. Europe to avert the evil eye. The <i>Inner
Gateway</i> still has its old Moorish doors studded with iron.</p>

<p class='c011'>A narrow passage ascends thence to the <i>House of Gómes Tortosa</i>
(on the right; Pl. 7, E, 3), the conservator of the Alhambra. Into
the N. wing is built the *<b>Puerta del Vino</b>, probably once the
main W. entrance of the <i>Alta Alhambra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>). This gate seems
to have been once connected by a wall with the Puerta de Hierro
(p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>), so as to shut off the Alcazaba, the palace, and the mosque
from the Alhambra suburb.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the top of the hill we enter the broad <span class='sc'>Plaza de los Aljibes</span>
(Pl. 8; E, 3), so named from the cistern (<i>al-jibb</i>) filled with water
from the Darro. The level of the plaza was raised about 16 ft. when
Charles V. built his palace, and it is now adorned with hedges of
myrtle. On the E. side rise the Moorish palace (p. <a href='#Page_82'>82</a>) and the
handsome building erected by the emperor (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>); on our left is
the E. front of the Alcazaba with two towers, the <i>Torre Quebrada</i>
and the <i>Torre del Homenaje</i>, 85 ft. in height (Pl. 10, 11; E, 3);
to the N. we look down into the Darro Valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Alcazaba</b> (Pl. E, 3; Arabic <i>Al-Kasaba</i>, ‘the citadel’) stands
about 460 ft. above the Plaza Nueva (p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>). Except on the E. the
hill falls away abruptly on all sides, and so suddenly on the N.E.,
in consequence of a landslip, that the castle-wall seems endangered.
The only entrance to the castle is now the <i>Puerta de la Alcazaba</i>
(Pl. 9; E, 3), at the S.W. angle of the Plaza de los Aljibes. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>interior of the castle is now occupied by gardens. Of the original
building scarcely anything remains except the ruined enclosing
wall, with its huge towers and external terraces (<i>Adarves</i>). At
several points the masonry resembles the concrete work of the
Romans (p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the W. extremity of the Alcazaba stands the ‘watch-tower’,
the *<span class='sc'>Torre de la Vela</span> (Pl. 13; E, 3), the <i>Ghafar</i> of the Moors,
on which the three ‘pendones’ of Ferdinand and Isabella were
displayed for the first time on 2nd Jan., 1492.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Vela Tower commands a very extensive *<span class='sc'>View</span> (doorkeeper 30 c.).
At our feet lies the entire city; to the left, beyond the Alhambra Park,
rise the Torres Bermejas; to the right, beyond the Darro, is the Albaicín;
in front of us extends the almost circular green Vega, enclosed by
brown and sun-scorched ranges of hills; to the S.E. towers the Sierra
Nevada; to the S. and S.W. rise the Sierra de Almijara, Sierra Tejea,
and Sierra de Alhama; to the W. are Santa Fe (p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>) and the hills of
Loja (p. <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>); then, to the N.W., are the Sierra de Parapanda (p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>), Sierra
de Elvira, and other hills. Lastly, to the E., we see the Moorish Alhambra
and the palace of Charles V., the church of Santa María (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>), the Generalife
(p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>), and the Silla del Moro (p. <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<span class='sc'>Jardín de los Adarves</span> (Pl. 15; E, 3), the S. terrace,
overgrown with venerable ivy and vines, is entered by a small door
(recognized by the iron scallop-shells on it) to the left of the
Alcazaba gate. The view is most picturesque, especially towards
evening.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The Moorish **<b>Alhambra Palace</b> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>), commonly
known as the <i>Casa Real</i>, adjoins the N.E. angle of the Plaza de los
Aljibes. Like other Moorish secular buildings it is externally insignificant,
and it is quite eclipsed by the huge palace of Charles V.
(p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>). Like the ancient Greek and Roman dwelling-houses it is
entirely closed on the outside, while all the rooms open on an
internal court as a common centre. When the house was enlarged
a new court had to be added, and so too the kings of Granada built
palace after palace, each with its own court and separate entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>On these buildings the highest efforts of Moorish art have been
expended. Their structural value is small; the materials, chiefly
wood and plaster, lack solidity, being often used for effect only;
while architectural rules are constantly violated. But the ingenious
disposition of the rooms and their sumptuous ornamentation,
whose fairy-like effect is too often marred by decay or by faulty
restoration, are unrivalled. The slender marble columns by which
the light walls are supported recall the tent-poles of the nomads,
while the mural decoration with its arabesques and flourishes
reminds one of an Oriental carpet. Very curious too is the ‘stalactite’
vaulting, formed by minute and countless projections of
the walls, ranged one above the other without visible support. The
Semitic abhorrence of any representation of living beings accounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>for the absence of sculpture, but some food for reflection was afforded
by the inscriptions with which all the wall-spaces are framed,
partly in the venerable Cufic characters (p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>), partly in Andalusian
flowing letters, extolling Allah and the reigning family.</p>

<p class='c011'>The present low-lying <span class='sc'>Entrance</span> (<i>Entrada Moderna</i>), adjacent
to the emperor’s palace, leads into the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Myrtle Court</b> (<i>Patio de la Alberca</i> or <i>de los Arrayanes</i>),
which belongs to the Comares palace (p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>), and derives its name
from the myrtle-hedges (<i>mesas de arrayanes</i>) around its pond
(<i>alberca</i>). The court is 121 ft. long and 75 ft. in breadth. At
its N.E. end rises the Comares tower (see below); to the S.W. it is
overlooked by Charles V.’s palace, which stands about 16 ft. higher.
At each end of the court is a beautiful arcade, borne by six slender
marble columns and paved with marble; that at the S.W. end, with
its upper gallery, open at the top, deserves special admiration.
At the N.E. end the arcades terminate in curious niches (Arabic
<i>ar-hanîya</i>) with stalactite vaulting, once coloured blue.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first door on the N.W. side of the court leads into the custodian’s
rooms, and the next but one into the <i>Patio del Mexuar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>); opposite
the latter door, from the S.E. wall of the court, stairs (generally closed)
descend to the <i>Baths</i> (p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>). Opposite the entrance of the palace is a
door leading into the <i>Sala de los Mocárabes</i> (p. <a href='#Page_84'>84</a>) and the <i>Lions’ Court</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>). The stairs in the S.W. angle of the court lead into the interior
of Charles V.’s palace (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>An ornate horseshoe arch at the N.E. end of the court gives
access to the ante-room of the Comares Tower, the <b>Sala de la
Barca</b>, whose barrel-vaulting was destroyed by a fire in 1899.
By the entrance are two niches for water-vessels. The wall of the
tower is pierced with a superb archway, right and left of which
are two other fine niches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ruinous <b>Torre de Comares</b>, 148 ft. in height, built, it
is said, by workmen from Comares, and crowned, with modern
pinnacles, contains the—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Hall of the Ambassadors</b> (<i>Sala de los Embajadores</i>),
a room in two stories, 36 ft. square and 59 ft. high, once the
royal reception room. The last meeting of the Moors under Boabdil,
before the capitulation of Granada, was held here in 1491.
Inscriptions record that Yûsuf I. was the builder. The larch-wood
dome of the hall has been compared to the facetted surface of a
cut diamond. The immense thickness of the walls is apparent from
the depth of the window-niches, each of which affords a different
view. The central windows (so-called <i>Ajimez</i>, Arabic <i>khamsîya</i>)
are each divided into two by a slender column. This hall is one of
the most richly decorated in the Alhambra.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the first window-niche on the right in the S.E. wall a passage
leads to the <i>Peinador de la Reina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>) and to the lower floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>We return to the Myrtle Court and (as indicated above) pass
through the Sala de los Mocárabes into the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>**<b>Court of the Lions</b> (<i>Patio de Los Leones</i>), which owes its
name to the <i>Fuente de los Leones</i>, a famous fountain borne by
twelve lions. The building was begun by Mohammed V. in 1377. The
court, 92 by 52 ft., is bordered all round with a colonnade, from
which at each end protrudes a superb domed pavilion. The columns
are alternately single and grouped. The tasteful elegance of this
court, originally shaded by six orange-trees, contrasts strikingly
with the showy pomp of the Myrtle Court. The fretwork decoration
in stucco looks like carved ivory. Besides the lion-fountain, the
court contains, at the ends of the arcade, eight flat marble fountain-basins.
The fountains play on a few festival-days only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Court of the Lions, whose upper floor contained the
women’s apartments, restored in 1907, is adjoined by handsome
rooms all round. On the N.W. side is the present ante-room of
the court, called the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Sala de los Mocárabes</b>, 72 ft. long, but only 13 ft. wide.
The handsome barrel-vaulting in the Renaissance style was added
after an explosion of gunpowder in 1614, but remains of the old
dome and mural decoration have been brought to light.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Hall of the Abencerrages</b>, to the S.W. of the Lions’
Court, derives its name from a noble family (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>), whose leading
members, as the story goes, were beheaded at the fountain in the
centre of this hall on account of an intrigue of Hamet, their chief,
with king Boabdil’s wife. We note specially the magnificent door
of entrance, and the curious way in which it is fitted to the doorposts.
The central part of the hall rises in three stories, upon
which open two lower alcoves with beautiful toothed arches and
coffered ceilings. Over the gallery of the second story eight stalactite
pendentives form the transition to the sixteen-sided third
story, whose windows diffuse a subdued light. Lastly, the hall is
roofed with massive stalactite vaulting.</p>

<p class='c016'>Adjoining the Hall of the Abencerrages, on the left and right, are
the <i>Patinillo</i> and the <i>Aljibe</i> or cistern.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<b>Sala de la Justicia</b> (also called <i>Sala del Tribunal</i> or
<i>de los Reyes</i>), on the S.E. side of the Court of the Lions, is a hall
in seven sections, with three arched entrances from the court, each
divided by two columns. Between these open sections, which are
roofed with lofty domes lighted from above, are two lower chambers.
Adjoining the ends and the E. side are side-rooms or alcoves,
some of them dark. The whole of this hall, with its honeycomb
vaulting and stalactite arches, presents the appearance of some
fantastic grotto.</p>

<p class='c016'>The three larger side-rooms have ceiling-paintings of the early 15th
century. The central picture, which has given rise to the different names
of the hall (‘hall of justice’, ‘hall of the kings’, etc.), probably represents
the first ten kings of Granada, beginning with Mohammed I., or, according
to others, a meeting of council, or a court of justice. The paintings in
the two other alcoves depict hunting and jousting scenes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>In the central alcove is a Moorish <i>Trough</i> (pila) of 1306, with curious
reliefs of lions devouring stags, of eagles, etc.—The alabaster <i>Tombstones</i>
in the alcove at the S.W. end of the hall are from the <i>Rauda</i>, the dilapidated
royal vault of the Alhambra.</p>

<p class='c009'>Opposite the Hall of the Abencerrages we ascend from the N.E.
side of the Court of the Lions by a narrow passage (<i>pasadizo</i>) to
the—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Sala de las Dos Hermanas</b> (<i>Hall of the Two Sisters</i>),
which lies in the same axis as the Sala de los Ajimeces and Mirador
de Daraxa, two other rooms situated at a higher level. This suite
of rooms seems to have formed the winter residence of the ruler’s
harem. The chief of these, whose ornamentation is perhaps the
most exquisite in the Alhambra, has its name from the two marble
slabs in the pavement. In particular we admire the beautiful doors,
the mural decoration in stucco, and above all the honeycomb vaulting,
the largest of all Arab roofs of the kind.</p>

<p class='c016'>In a corner of the hall stands the *<i>Alhambra Vase</i> (‘el jarro de la
Alhambra’), 4 ft. 5 in. in height, dating from 1320, and adorned with enamel,
figures of animals (gazelles?), etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>We next pass through the <i>Sala de los Ajimeces</i>, with its ajimeces
(p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>) and fine vaulting (a closed passage on the left leads hence
to the Peinador de la Reina and the Patio de la Reja, p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>), to
the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Mirador de Daraxa</b> (‘entrance-room’). This charming bay
has three windows, reaching nearly to the ground and overlooking
the Patio de Daraxa (p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We may now return through the Court of the Lions to the Myrtle
Court, and from the N.W. side (as indicated at p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>) of the latter
descend through the <i>Zaguán</i> or forecourt to the <b>Patio del
Mexuar</b>, lying 13 ft. lower. This is the oldest part of the Alhambra.
On the N.E. side of the court is a pleasing <i>Atrium</i>, with
columns and a horseshoe arch of 1522. The adjacent <i>Cuarto Dorado</i>
also has Mudejar decoration of the time of Charles V.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Mexuar</b> (Arabic <i>meshwâr</i>, council-chamber), now the
<i>Capilla</i>, was fitted up as such in 1537–44, but not used as the
palace chapel till 1629. During the Moorish period it perhaps
served as an audience chamber or law-court, and the gallery as a
meeting-place for the council of state.—A modern door leads into
the <i>Mosala</i>, the Moorish chapel built by Mohammed V., which
belonged to the old <i>Cuarto de Machuca</i> (p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>), now almost entirely
occupied by gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly opposite the Christian Chapel in the Mexuar Court is
the underground <i>Viaduct</i> leading to the Baths (right) and to the
Patio de la Reja.</p>

<p class='c011'>The extensive subterranean *<b>Baths</b> (<i>Baños</i>), to the N.E. of the
Myrtle Court, in the style of those of ancient Rome (comp. p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>),
date from the time of Yûsuf I. The first room, now freely restored,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>resembling an Apodyterium, is the <i>Sala de las Camas</i> or <i>de los
Divanes</i>, with two niches for couches, and is remarkable for its
graceful superstructure. The gallery was destined for the singing
girls. The chief bath-chamber (<i>cuartos y sudoríficos</i>) corresponds
to the Tepidarium, and marble baths still exist. The heating
apparatus (<i>calorífero</i>) has been destroyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Sala de las Camas we enter the *<b>Patio de Daraxa</b>
(p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>), planted with cypresses, formerly the inner garden of the
palace, but altered by Charles V. Only the upper basin of the
fountain is Moorish. The rooms on the upper floor (<i>Aposentos de
Carlos Quinto</i>) contain the Alhambra archives.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small <i>Patio de la Reja</i>, with its fountain and four cypresses,
so called from its window-gratings, dates only from 1654–55.—The
stairs at the N.E. corner lead (left) to the Hall of the
Ambassadors (p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>), and (right) to a new corridor which brings
us to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Peinador de la Reina</b> (the ‘Queen’s Dressing-room’), on
the upper floor of the <i>Torre del Peinador</i> erected by Yûsuf I. The
‘grotesque’ paintings, in the style of the Vatican logge, and the
scenes from Charles V.’s expedition to Tunis (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) are by <i>Julio
de Aquilés</i> and <i>Alex. Mayner</i>.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Palace of Charles V.</b> (Pl. 17, E, 2; entrance, see
p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>) is a massive square pile of 207 ft. each way and 57 ft.
in height, with a heavy rustica groundfloor and an upper story
of the Ionic order, terminating in a Doric cornice. The building
was designed by <i>Pedro Machuca</i> in the Italian high-Renaissance
style, in 1526, and its cost was defrayed out of the tribute paid
by the Moors. The only completed parts are the façades, the superb
circular colonnaded court, of the Doric order below and the Ionic
above, and the main staircase, which was not finished till 1635.
The richly sculptured W. and S. portals, executed by many different
masters, are specially attractive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing round the S. side of the palace of Charles V., we cross
the Plaza de los Alămos to the church of <i>Santa María</i> (Pl. 18;
E, F, 2), which stands on the site of the <i>Mezquita Real</i> or Alhambra
mosque.</p>

<p class='c016'>The buildings of the <b>Alta Alhambra</b> (p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>) also present several
features of interest. To the N. of Santa María we cross the Alameda,
pass (on the left) the ruins of the Rauda (p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>) and the outside of the
Court of the Lions, and then descend to the left to the <i>Torre de las Damas</i>
(Pl. 20; E, 2), a fortified tower of the time of Yûsuf I., restored in 1907–8,
with a sumptuous interior. Fine view from the Mirador (p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>).—A few
paces to the E. lies the <b>Carmen de Arratía</b>, a private house with a
charming garden (above the gate is the inscription ‘Mezquita árabe de la
Alhambra’). The house contains a <i>Moorish Chapel</i>, also dating from the
time of Yûsuf I., with an elegant mihrâb or prayer-niche.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Farther on in the same direction we come to the <i>Torre de los Picos</i>
(Pl. 21; F, 2) and cross a bastion (<i>baluarte</i>) to the <b>Puerta de Hierro</b>
(Pl. 22; F, 2), restored by the ‘Catholic kings’, which forms the entrance
to the Alhambra from the Cuesta del Rey Chico (p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>On the margin of the plateau above this road are four towers, the
two finest of which, time permitting, we may visit under the guidance
of the custodian, who lives in the Torre de la Pólvora. These are the
<b>Torre de la Cautiva</b> (Pl. 23; F, 2), the chief room in which vies with
the sumptuous halls of the Alhambra palace itself, and the <i>Torre de las
Infantas</i> (Pl. 24; F, 2), an excellent point of view.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the S.W. margin of the plateau, beyond the <i>Torre del Agua</i> (Pl. 25;
F, 2), where towards evening we have a splendid view of the town, the
Vega, and the Sierra Nevada, is a bastion above which rises the <i>Puerta
de los Siete Suelos</i> (Pl. 26; F, 2). By this gate Boabdil, the last of the
Moorish kings (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>), made his final exit from the Alhambra.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>d. The Generalife.</h4>

<p class='c021'>At the foot of the <i>Cerro del Sol</i>, to the E. of the Alhambra,
about 160 ft. above the Alhambra Hill, rises the *<b>Palacio de
Generalife</b> (Pl. E, F, 1), once the famous summer residence of
the Moorish kings, and now owned by the Marquesa de Campotéjar
(p. <a href='#Page_77'>77</a>). The name is a corruption of the Arabic <i>Jennat al-Arîf</i>,
‘garden of Arîf’, the original owner. According to the inscription
it was redecorated by order of Abu’l-Walîd Ismaîl in 1319, but in
1494 it was altered and enlarged by Queen Isabella. The interior
is very dilapidated; the ornamentation, which is about half-a-century
earlier than that of the chief apartments in the Alhambra,
is mostly whitewashed.</p>

<p class='c011'>We ascend by the Camino del Cementerio, a continuation of
the three Alhambra Park routes (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>), and by the Cuesta del
Rey Chico (p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>), and ring at the <i>Outer Gate</i> (Pl. 27, F, 2; adm.,
see p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>; fee to the porter, also to the gardener): A cypress-avenue
leads thence to the N. to the <i>Entrance</i> (Pl. 28; F, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>The picturesque <span class='sc'>Court</span> is still, as in Moorish times, planted
with myrtle-hedges and orange-trees and intersected by a water-conduit.
The buildings on the E. side date from the 16th cent.;
along the W. side runs a <i>Colonnade</i> with pointed arches, the central
door of which opens on a <i>Mirador</i> (Arabic <i>manzar</i>, <i>i.e.</i> belvedere),
which is now a chapel. On the N. side we pass through a five-arched
<i>Gallery</i>, and then through a three-arched <i>Portal</i> into a
quadrangular <span class='sc'>Hall</span> with two alcoves. Beyond this is a square room
with a balcony commanding a splendid view of the Darro Valley.
The modern side-rooms are uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Park</span>, to the E. of the main building and above it, was
laid out in Moorish times. We first enter the <i>Patio de los Cipreses</i>,
with a gallery built in 1584–6, and shaded with venerable cypresses.
A Moorish flight of steps, with grooves for water on the balustrades,
ascends to a <i>Mirador</i> (Pl. 29; F, 1), where we enjoy a glorious
*View of Granada, the Alhambra, and the valley of the Darro.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>A good survey of the Alhambra and of the whole Sierra Nevada is
obtained from the <i>Silla del Moro</i> (Pl. F, 1), a spur of the Cerro del Sol.
It is reached in 12 min. from the Cementerio road (p. <a href='#Page_87'>87</a>) by a path
diverging halfway between the gate of the Generalife and the cemetery,
and then crossing a gorge.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>11. From Granada viâ Bobadilla to Málaga.</h3>

<p class='c016'>119½ M. <span class='sc'>Railway</span> in 6–6¼ hrs. (fares 28 p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>, 22 p. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>, 15 p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a> c.);

<p class='c009'>From Granada to (76 M.) <i>Bobadilla</i>, see pp. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>, 72. The train
then continues to follow the <i>Guadalhorce Valley</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>At (84½ M.) <i>Gobantes</i> begins the *<b>Hoyo de Chorro</b>, a ravine,
inaccessible before the railway was made, where the Guadalhorce
forces its passage through the limestone slate rock of the coast-hills.
The train is carried along the left bank by means of tunnels
and of high bridges crossing lateral gorges. Little, however, of
the grand rocky landscape, or of the interesting construction of the
line, is seen from the train on its rapid descent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond (89 M.) <i>Chorro</i> are seen the first oranges, lemons, palms,
and cypresses. On the short run to Málaga we are carried with
more startling suddenness than anywhere else in Europe into the
midst of an almost tropical vegetation, and finally to the coast-region
of sugar-cane, cotton, and bananas (comp. p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>96 M. <b>Alora</b> (328 ft.; pop. 10,300), the ancient <i>Iluro</i>, lies to the
right at the foot of the <i>Sierra del Hacho</i>. The ‘huertas’, or garden-like
fields, are watered by numerous runlets from the Guadalhorce.
Beyond the last tunnel the valley expands. 101½ M. <i>Pizarra</i>. To
the S. rises the <i>Sierra de Mijas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>109 M. <i>Cártama</i>. The village, the Roman <i>Cartima</i>, lies 2½ M.
to the S.W., on the right bank of the Guadalhorce, which was once
navigable up to this point. The loftily situated castle is Moorish.</p>

<p class='c011'>112½ M. <i>Campanillas</i> lies on the stream of that name, which
waters the hilly wine-country of <i>Axarquía</i> to the N., and falls into
the Guadalhorce. The valley broadens down into the plain, the
<i>Hoya de Málaga</i> (p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>). We now leave the Guadalhorce, which
turns to the S.E.; to the S. we sight the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c016'>119½ M. <b>Málaga.</b>—<span class='sc'>Arrival.</span> At the <span class='sc'>Railway Station</span> (<i>Estación
del Ferrocarril</i>; Pl. A, 5) we find hotel-omnibuses, cabs (see p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>), and an
‘omnibus general’ (¼ p.), which last goes to the <i>Despacho Central</i>, or
town-office of the railway, by the so-called Puerta del Mar (Calle de

<p class='c009'><i>Málaga</i>, the capital of a province and seat of a bishop, one of
the oldest and most famous of Mediterranean ports, with 111,900
inhab., lies picturesquely on the last spurs of a circus of hills, 47 M.
long, the <i>Sierra Tejea</i>, <i>S. de Alhama</i>, <i>S. de Abdalajis</i>, and <i>S. de
Mijas</i>, which enclose the broad <i>Bahía de Málaga</i>. The inner
part of this bay is bounded on the E. by the <i>Punta de los Cántales</i>,
and on the W. by the <i>Torre de Pimentel</i>, near Torremolinos; between
these rises the <i>Gibralfaro</i>, the castle-hill of Málaga, abutting
on the harbour. The coast-line is gradually being extended
seawards by the alluvial deposits of the <i>Guadalmedina</i> (Arabic
‘town-river’), whose bed, generally dry (Rambla), separates the old
town from the W. suburbs. To the W. stretches the wonderfully
fertile <i>Vega</i> or <i>Hoya de Málaga</i>, where even the sugar-cane, cotton,
sweet potatoes (Convolvulus batatas), and cherimolias (Anona
cherimolia) are cultivated. Most famous among the products of this
luxuriant region are the raisins (pasas) and the wines of Málaga,
which are yielded by the Axarquía (p. <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>), to the N.W., and by the
Montes de Málaga and the hill of Colmenar, to the N.E., and which
are chiefly exported by British and German firms. In the W. suburbs
are several sugar, cotton, and iron factories, a rare phenomenon in
Andalusia. To the E. are the villa-suburbs, the strangers’ quarter.
Málaga is much resorted to as a winter residence, chiefly by British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and Spanish visitors, on account of the mildness of its climate, the
mean temperature of the three winter months being 55° Fahr.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>History</span> of Málaga, the <i>Malaca</i> of antiquity, begins with the
Phœnicians (p. <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>), who gave the town its name. Down to the time of
Posidonius, the contemporary of Pompey and Cicero, it retained its Punic
character (Strabo III, 4), differing therein from the towns of Iberian or
of Greek origin. The Syrian and other Asiatic merchants who settled
here formed distinct guilds. Although the port was of some importance in
ancient times, it now contains no memorials of either the Phœnician (except
a few coins) or of the Roman period. In 571 <i>Leovigild</i>, the Visigoth
(p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>), wrested the town from the Byzantines. In 711 it was captured
by the Moors, who regarded it as an earthly paradise, and whose Arabic
writers vie with each other in extolling it. After 1246, along with Almería,
it became one of the chief ports of the kingdom of Granada, but
its mediæval glory ended with its conquest by Ferdinand and Isabella in
1487. For centuries Málaga remained utterly insignificant; but of late,
in spite of the growing competition of Seville and Almería, its trade has
improved considerably.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the station we follow the tramway line and cross the
<i>Puente de Tetuán</i> (Pl. B, 4) to the <span class='sc'>Paseo de la Alameda</span> (Pl. B,
C, 4), a promenade ¼ M. long and 138 ft. wide, planted with planes.
At its W. end it is adorned with a marble <i>Fountain</i> executed in
Genoa in 1560, and at the E. end with a statue of the <i>Marqués de
Larios</i>. Adjoining this Paseo on the E. is the <span class='sc'>Plaza de Alfonso
Suárez de Figueroa</span> (Pl. C, 4), with a tasteful fountain, which leads
to the new—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Park</b> (<i>Parque</i> or <i>Jardines de Enrique Crooke Larios</i>; Pl.
C-E, 4, 3), planted with six rows of planes and palms and with fine
flower-beds. View of the harbour, part of the cathedral, the Alcazaba,
and the Gibralfaro.—The <i>Paseo de Heredia</i> (Pl. C, 5, 4) also,
to the W. of the harbour, is planted with planes and palms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Harbour</b> (<i>Puerto</i>; Pl. C, D, 4, 5) has been much improved
since 1881. The E. pier, with the <i>Lighthouse</i> (Faro; Pl. D, 5), was
already built in 1588. On the sand-hills behind the pier a poor
suburb has sprung up, called the <i>Barrio de Malagueta</i> (Pl. E, F,
4, 3). On its N. side are the <i>Plaza de Toros</i> (Bull Ring; Pl. E, 3)
and the <i>Hospital Noble</i>, erected for seamen by Dr. Noble, an
English physician.—To the Caleta, see p. <a href='#Page_92'>92</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Mercado</i> (market-hall; Pl. B, C, 4), to the N. of the Alameda,
deserves an early morning visit; the fish-stalls also are worth
seeing. The horseshoe arch of the chief portal, with the motto of
the Nasride dynasty (p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>), is a relic of the Moorish wharf, the
<i>Atarazana</i> (Arabic Dâr as-San῾a, ‘arsenal’ or ‘place of work’).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Alameda issues the <span class='sc'>Calle del Marqués de Larios</span>
(Pl. C, 4, 3), the chief business street of Málaga (many cafés) and
also a favourite resort of the fashionable and leisured classes.
Another important commercial thoroughfare, to the N.E. of the
Plaza de la Constitución, is the <span class='sc'>Calle de Granada</span> (Pl. C, D, 3),
officially called <i>Calle de Salvador Solier</i>, from which the Calle
de Molina Larios leads to the cathedral.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The *<b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. C, D, 3; open 7–11 and 3 to 4.30, in
summer 4 to 5.30), a massive edifice, marred, however, by the buildings
on the E. side, occupies the site of a Moorish mosque, which
was converted in 1487 into the Gothic <i>Church of the Incarnation</i>
(Encarnación). The present church, which is built entirely of white
limestone, was probably planned by <i>Diego de Siloe</i> (p. <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>) in 1538.
The building progressed slowly, but in 1554 it already showed the
arms of Philip II. of Spain and Queen Mary of England. In 1680
it was partly destroyed by an earthquake, but in 1719 the work
was resumed with greater energy. It has, however, never been
completed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief W. façade, approached by a fine flight of marble steps
and flanked with two projecting towers, rises opposite the Plaza del
Obispo in two stories, articulated with Corinthian columns. Corresponding
with the three portals are the round-arched windows of
the second story. The N. tower, 280 ft. high, has a third story
with Corinthian columns, surmounted by an octagon with a dome
and lantern. The S. tower, like the central part of the façade,
shows only the beginnings of a third story. The portals of the
transept also are flanked with towers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span>, with its nave and aisles and two rows of chapels,
measures 377 by 246 ft. and is 131 ft. in height. The transept and the
ambulatory are grandly proportioned. The round arches of the ornate
vaulting are borne by two sets of pillars, one above the other, the lower
being enriched with Corinthian pilasters.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the nave is the <span class='sc'>Choir</span>, with its admirable stalls (16–17th cent.).
The carved *Statues of saints and other figures are by <i>Pedro de Mena</i>
(d. 1693).</p>

<p class='c022'>In the <span class='sc'>Right Aisle</span> is the Capilla del Rosario (the 3rd), which contains
a Madonna of the Rosary with six saints, by <i>Alonso Cano</i>.—In the
1st chapel of the <span class='sc'>Ambulatory</span>, the Capilla de los Reyes, are kneeling
statues of the ‘Catholic kings’ (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>) and an image of the Virgin which
they always carried with them on their crusades.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Capilla Mayor</span>, designed by <i>Al. Cano</i>, is formed by a semicircle
of light detached pillars. The handsome altar, in the form of a domed
temple with four façades, is modern.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>N. Tower</span> (entered from outside; over 200 steps; custodian 30–40 c.)
commands a strikingly picturesque *View.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Sagrario</i>, the parish church to the N.W. of the cathedral,
has a rich Gothic N. portal from the older cathedral.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Calle de San Agustín, passing the <i>Ayuntamiento</i> (Pl. D, 3),
leads back to the Calle de Granada (p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>). At the N.E. end of the
latter, on the right, near the Plaza de Riego (Pl. D, 2, 3), rises the
church of <i>Santiago el Mayor</i> (Pl. D, 3), built on the site of a mosque
in 1490, with a tower whose lower part is still Moorish.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the traveller is undeterred by dirty streets and begging children,
he may ascend from the Plaza de Riego to the S.E. viâ the
Calle del Mundo Nuevo to the saddle of the <i>Coracha</i> and the Moorish
castle of <b>Alcazaba</b> (Pl. D, 3; p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>), the scanty ruins of which are
chiefly inhabited by gipsies. This hill-town, once connected with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the Gibralfaro by double walls, probably stands on the site of the
earliest Phœnician settlement.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Gibralfaro</b> (Pl. E, 2, 3; 558 ft.; from <i>jebel</i>, mountain,
and <i>pharos</i>, lighthouse), whose original fortifications date back to
the 13th cent., affords an extensive view, ranging to the S., in very
clear weather, as far as the Monte Melila in Africa (p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>). The
ascent from the Coracha (p. <a href='#Page_91'>91</a>) is fairly easy. Leave to see the
castle must be obtained beforehand from the commandant, at the
Gobierno Militar, Alameda de Colón 2. The same views may be
obtained by walking round the old enclosing walls, but this is
fatiguing.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the foot of the Gibralfaro runs the Avenida de Pries (Pl. F, 3),
leading to the villa-quarter of <b>Caleta</b> (Pl. F, G, 3), where are several
pensions and many superb gardens. (Electric tramway from the
Paseo de Alameda to Palo; also steam-tramway from the harbour
to Vélez-Málaga.) Immediately on the left is the pretty Protestant
cemetery, or <b>Cementerio Inglés</b>, founded in 1830 by the British
consul W. Mark (usually open). The little <i>English Church</i> here was
built in 1891. At the E. end of Caleta, beyond the <i>Hot.-Restaurant
Hernán Cortés</i> (Pl. k; G, 3), roads diverge to the left for the <i>Limonar
Valley</i> (Pl. G, 2, 1), where lie the residential suburbs of <i>Limonar</i>,
<i>Higueral</i>, and <i>Miramar</i>.—We may follow the highroad,
which affords charming views, but is generally very dusty, to the
fishing-village of <i>Palo</i>, 2 M. beyond the Hot. Hernán Cortés.</p>

<p class='c016'>A delightful excursion may be taken to the beautiful park of the
<i>Hacienda de San José</i>, 2½ M. to the N. of Málaga, and to the villa of
*<b>La Concepción</b>, a little beyond it. The latter contains an elegant
modern temple with Roman antiquities. The road (carr., see p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>) leads
from the Plaza de Capuchinos up the Guadalmedina. From the Cementerio
de San Miguel (comp. Pl. D, 1; tramway) walkers may wander along
the water-conduit, halfway up the slope (40 min.), and then descend the
avenue of plane-trees to the left to the highroad.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Morocco</i>, a region 270,000 sq. M. in area, extends from the Straits of Gibraltar on the N. to the Sahara on the S., and is bounded
by the Atlantic Ocean on the W. and by the French colony of Algiers
on the E. It is called by the Arabs <i>El-Gharb</i> or <i>Maghreb el-Aksâ</i>
(‘the extreme West-land’), being the westmost part of the ancient
Barbary (Arabic <i>Jezirat el-Maghreb</i>, ‘island of the West’), the
long coast-land of N. Africa between the Libyan desert and the
ocean. The backbone of this region, whose population is estimated
at from six to eight millions, is formed by the <i>Morocco Atlas</i>, the
highest mountains in N. Africa, a folded rock-formation, mostly of
early origin. The range consists of three main chains: the barren
<i>Great Atlas</i>, an enormous wall of rock culminating in the <i>Tamyurt</i>
and <i>Likumpt</i> (about 14,800 ft.); then the <i>Lesser Atlas</i> to the N.,
rising in the territory of the Beni Waraïn tribe to over 13,000 ft.,
and separated from the Great Atlas by the <i>Wâd el-Abid</i> and the
<i>Mulûya</i>; and lastly the <i>Anti-Atlas</i> and <i>Jebel Sarro</i> or <i>Saghro</i>,
parallel with the Great Atlas, and about 6500 ft. in height. A low
range of hills, called the <i>Jebel Bani</i>, between the Anti-Atlas and
the river <i>Draa</i>, forms the boundary between Morocco and the
Sahara. On the N.W. side of these mountains, between them and
the ocean, lies an extensive intermediate tableland called the <i>Tell</i>,
steppe-like in character, with a girdle of oases, whence protrude
the <i>Jebilet</i>, the <i>Jebel el-Hadid</i>, the <i>Jebel Akhdar</i> or <i>Lakhdar</i>,
and several smaller isolated heights, which are evidently relics
of an ancient range of mountains. The seaboard itself consists of
the plain between the rivers <i>Tensift</i> and Sebu (rendered extremely
fertile by its mantle of black soil, <i>Tuaress</i> or <i>Tîrs</i>), and of the
marshy flats on the lower course of the <i>Sebu</i> (ancient <i>Subur</i>), the
most copious stream in Barbary. These occupy a district once
penetrated by the sea, and geologically resembling the basin of
the Guadalquivir (p. <a href='#Page_49'>49</a>). The entire Mediterranean coast, on the
other hand, from the Straits of Gibraltar to the Mulûya valley
(p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>), is bordered by the <i>Rîf Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>), a range culminating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>in the <i>Jebel Mulaï Abd es-Slam</i> (p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>; 5742 ft.) and the
<i>Jebel Tiziren</i> (ca. 8200 ft.), these being folded mountains of recent
formation, clothed with extensive forests of Atlas cedar (p. <a href='#Page_210'>210</a>)
and arar (Callitris quadrivalvis L.). The Rîf Mts. and the Atlas
are sharply separated by a deep depression watered by the Sebu
and its tributary the <i>Innaûen</i> on the W., and by the <i>Msûn</i>, an
affluent of the Mulûya, on the E., a valley which once formed the
most important route between Morocco and Algeria. Both of these
mountain-ranges are said to contain great mineral wealth (iron,
copper, zinc, silver, gold, etc.), but as yet it has only been tapped
to a small extent by the natives, chiefly in the <i>Sûs</i>, the region
between the Great and the Anti-Atlas, and near <i>Ujda</i> (p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Great and the Lesser Atlas, whose chief peaks are covered
with perpetual snow, afford also an abundant supply of water, which
is utilized for irrigation, though as yet very inadequately, by means
of open cuttings (<i>sakhiâ</i>) or underground conduits (<i>foggâra</i> or <i>khattâra</i>).
The rainfall in Morocco diminishes as we proceed southwards
from the Straits of Gibraltar; at Tangier it is 32 in.; at Mogador,
16 in.; while in the interior (as at Marakesh, 11 in.), and particularly
on the S. margin of the Great Atlas, it becomes very insignificant.
In the interior the climate may be described as continental
(as at Marakesh, where the mean temperature of January
is 51½° Fahr., and that of July 84½°), while that of the S. part of
the ocean seaboard, thanks to the prevalent N.W. winds and the N.
to S. ocean currents, vies with that of Madeira in mildness and
equableness. Thus at Rabât the mean of January is 55°, that of
August 75°; at Mogador 61° and 72°, respectively. The variations
are greater near the Straits (as at Tangier, 50° and 75°) and particularly
on the Rîf seaboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Morocco is inhabited chiefly by <i>Berbers</i>, the white Hamitic
indigenous race of N. Africa; of these the <i>Amâziges</i> live in the N.W.,
the <i>Berâbs</i> in the Atlas, and the <i>Shilluh</i> or <i>Shluh</i> on the ocean
coast. Some of them retain their ancient languages (<i>Tamâzirt</i>, or
<i>Shelha</i>, and <i>Berbri</i>), which are akin to early Egyptian, but many,
especially the dwellers in the low country, have spoken Arabic
since the middle ages. Pure <i>Arab Tribes</i>, mostly survivors of the
Beni Hilal and Beni Soleïm immigrants (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), are chiefly met
with in the Sebu plain and in the S.W. steppe-region. Many of the
dwellers in the towns are <i>Moors</i> (Andalûsi) of Spanish origin, while
numerous <i>Jews</i> are settled, usually in a walled ghetto (<i>Mellah</i>),
under the direct protection of the sultan. <i>Negroes</i>, too, most of
whom were originally slaves, imported from the Sudan by way of
the Tafilet, abound in the southern districts of Morocco. The S.W.
provinces of Sûs, Wâd Draa, and Wâd Nûn, which are interesting
on account of their primæval African flora (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>), are mostly inhabited
by the despised <i>Harrâtin</i> (sing. <i>Hartâni</i>), the hybrid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>offspring of negroes and Berbers, or, according to others, descendants
of the indigenous population of N. Africa.</p>

<p class='c011'>Owing to the inaccessibility of its mountains and the natives’
passionate love of independence, coupled with their hatred of foreigners,
Morocco has ever been one of the least explored regions.
The settlements of the Phœnicians and Carthaginians were limited
to a few places on the coast, such as <i>Rusaddir</i> (Melilla?) and
<i>Ceuta</i>, and also, beyond the pillars of Hercules (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>), <i>Tingis</i> (?),
<i>Zilis</i> (Arzila), <i>Lixus</i> (p. <a href='#Page_105'>105</a>), and <i>Sala</i> (Salee). The Romans
also seem to have shunned the Rîf region, and scarcely ever to
have penetrated into the interior beyond Meknes (Mequinez) in the
<i>Zerhun Mts.</i> From the time of Emp. Claudius (42 A. D.) Morocco,
with Tingis as its capital, formed the <i>Provincia Mauretania
Tingitana</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>); and after the reign of Diocletian it became
part of the Spanish <i>Provincia Ulterior</i>. In the early Christian
period also the coast of Morocco, whose inhabitants had joined the
<i>Donatists</i> (p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>), shared the fortunes of Spain, belonging successively
to the Vandals (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), the Eastern Romans, and (after 620)
the Visigoths, until in 682 it fell into the hands of the Arabs under
<i>Sidi Okba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), and then after long struggles was united with
the caliphate of Damascus (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>). Although the Berber tribes of
Morocco were thenceforth among the most zealous champions of
Islam, and in 711, at the instance of <i>Mûsa</i>, the governor, had
undertaken their victorious expedition against Spain under <i>Târik</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>), yet they afterwards took part in the Kharijite movement
against the Arabs (comp. p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>). In 788 <i>Idris I.</i> (d. 793), an Arab
refugee and a descendant of the Prophet (‘sherif’), founded the
oldest Moroccan dynasty, that of the <i>Idrisides</i>, and under <i>Idris II.</i>
(793–828) Fez became their new capital in 807 instead of Volubilis
in the Zerhun Mts. After the fall of the Idrisides the country was
divided among Berber princes, and its independence was threatened
by Omaiyades (p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>) and Fatimites (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) alternately. At
length in 1055 it succumbed to the attacks of the <i>Almoravides</i>
(Morabitîn, comp. p. <a href='#Page_368'>368</a>), a Berber sect from the W. Sahara, who
under <i>Abu Bekr’s</i> lead converted the inhabitants of the interior
as far as the Sudan to Islam. Under <i>Yûsuf ibn Têshufîn</i> they
took possession of Agâdir in 1081 (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>) and of Ceuta in 1084,
and in 1086 took the lead in the struggle against the unbelievers
in the Iberian peninsula. Morocco became still more powerful
under the <i>Almohades</i>, a Berber sect formed in 1181 in the district
now called Oran (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), especially under the gifted caliph <i>Abd
el-Mûmen</i> (1130–63), who, after the battle of Tlemcen (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>),
extended his sway over the Moorish states of Spain, and in 1160
as far as Barca (p. <a href='#Page_414'>414</a>). After the overthrow of the Almohades in
1212 there arose in Barbary the three new kingdoms of the
<i>Merinides</i> at Fez, the <i>Abdelwadites</i> (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>) at Tlemcen, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><i>Hafsides</i> (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) in Tunis, whose strength was exhausted by
sanguinary internecine struggles which lasted for centuries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The attacks of the <i>Portuguese</i>, who took Ceuta in 1415, occupied
Arzila and Tangier in 1471, and after 1500 even threatened
Marakesh from their base on the ocean seaboard, coupled with
the advance of the Spaniards, who after the fall of Granada (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>)
had conquered Melilla, called forth the new counter-movement of
the <i>Saadites</i> of the Draa. To this new dynasty, after the conquest
of Marakesh in 1520 and of Fez in 1550, tho feeble dynasty of
the Merinides succumbed in 1554. Morocco was afterwards torn
by sanguinary family feuds, yet owing to the destruction of the
Portuguese army in the ‘battle of the three kings’ at Alcázar (Ksar
el-Kebîr), and the influx of well-educated Moors expelled from
Spain, the kingdom was greatly strengthened and obtained a new
lease of life. It prospered once more, after 1649, under the sixth
dynasty, that of the <i>Filali</i>, a family from the Tafilet (see below),
and notably under the cruel <i>Mulaï Ismail</i> (1672–1727), one of the
most powerful princes of his age, who even fought against the Turks
in Oran (comp. p. <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>) and led a campaign against Timbuktu.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the defeat of the Portuguese the pirates of Larash (p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>)
and Salee (p. <a href='#Page_106'>106</a>), vying with the Rîf pirates and the ‘Barbaresques’
(p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), had seriously hampered European trade for two centuries
or more, but by the occupation of Algeria by the French and the
expedition of the Spaniards against Tetuán in 1859–60 the seaboard
of Morocco was at length opened up to European influence
and to commercial enterprise. In 1906 the Algeciras Conference
(p. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>) prevented the French from advancing towards Fez and
obtaining a passage from the Oran and Sahara railway through
the Tafilet or Tafilelt, the richest group of oases in S. Morocco, to
the ocean seaboard. In 1907, however, the unrest at Casablanca
(p. <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>), and also on the Algerian frontier, led to the French occupation
of that important seaport along with the adjacent Shâuya,
of Ujda (p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>), and of Berguent and Bu Denib in S.E. Morocco.
After the deposition of <i>Mulaï Abdul-Aziz</i> (1894–1907), who was
favourable to the French influence, <i>Mulaï Hafid</i> was proclaimed
sultan in 1908.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Morocco of to-day, whose institutions, manners, and customs
are still quite mediæval, consists of the so-called <i>Blad el-Makhzen</i>
(‘government land’), the dominion of the sultan, and the far larger
<i>Blad es-Siba</i> (‘outer land’), occupied by independent tribes. These
tribes recognize the sultan, or the grand sherif of Wazzân, a descendant
of the Idrisides, as their spiritual chief only, but usually
deny the sultan a right of way through their territory between the
capital towns of Fez and Marakesh.</p>

<p class='c011'>The foreign trade of Morocco is confined to the eight ‘open’
ports of Tangier, Larash, Rabât, Casablanca, Mazagan, Saffi, Mogador,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and Tetuán, to the capitals of Fez and Marakesh, and has
lately extended to Ujda and the Spanish Melilla (p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>). In 1909
its total volume amounted to 132,612,000 fr. of which were ascribed
to Great Britain 52,339,000 fr., to France 51,255,000 fr., to
Germany 13,582,000 fr., to Spain 6,456,000 fr., and to the United
States 1,111,000 fr. From France Morocco imports sugar, flour,
and silk, from England cotton goods, tea, rice, and candles, from
Germany iron wares, cloth, and sugar, and from Italy flour and wax-matches.
The exports (to Marseilles, Gibraltar, Spain, England,
Hamburg, etc., and also to Algeria and America) consist of goats’ and
sheep’s hides, fruit (almonds, oranges, etc.), eggs, cattle, chick-pease,
wheat, barley, and maize. The Morocco-leather slippers (<i>belra</i>,
yellow for men and red for women) go to Egypt, Algeria, and Senegal.
Besides the breeding of cattle, that of horses and mules also
is important. Sardines and other fish abound off the ocean coasts.</p>

<p class='c016'>Most travellers are satisfied with a visit to Tangier, an excursion to
Tetuán, and the interesting coasting voyage (best in April-Sept.) to Rabât
or Mogador. Europeans rarely travel in the interior, except perhaps in
Blad el-Makhzen, while in N. Morocco they should avoid the rainy winter
season. As roads, bridges, and inns are lacking, a costly equipment for
such expeditions is required, including tents, camp-beds, cooking utensils,
provisions, drinking-water, candles, medicines, insect-powder, etc. A guide
or mule-driver, a cook, an interpreter, and a soldier as an escort (mekhazni)
also are usually engaged. Lastly a mule (incl. attendant and fodder,
4–5 pesetas per day) is preferable to a horse (5 p. or upwards), being
more sure-footed and enduring. Before starting, the traveller should apply
for information and assistance to a consul or other experienced resident,
and obtain from them introductions to the local authorities (caid, pasha,
or amel) or to so-called protégés (semsar, mokhâlat). Persons of distinction
have a right to a formal reception by the authorities and to the mûna
(free provisions, like the ancient ‘purveyance’), for which, as also for
hospitality, a return is made either in kind (as firearms, telescopes,
watches, trinkets) or in money. In the country it is advisable to put up
at the village caravanserais (nzalas), where a night-watchman is provided
(fee) and where offerings by the peasants (milk, oranges, etc.; small fee)
should not be declined. At towns early arrival is essential, as all the
gates are closed at sunset. As to dealings with Mohammedans, comp.
p. xxv. Travellers are specially warned against photographing or even
entering their mosques, saints’ tombs, or burial-grounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the seaport-towns Spanish silver (p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>) and English or French
gold are current, but in the interior Spanish and Morocco money only
(silver coins of 5, 2½, 1¼, ½, and ¼ p.). In the interior letters of credit
addressed to Jewish or other firms are convenient.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>12. Tangier.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Arrival.</span> The steamers (see below) anchor in the open roads, and
passengers are conveyed to the pier in small boats. The German companies
furnish landing-tickets (1 <i>s.</i> for landing or embarking), otherwise the
tariff is 1 peseta (from the larger steamers 1¼ p.) each person; trunk ½,
hand-luggage ¼ p. When the sea is rough a blue flag is hoisted on the
pier and fares are doubled; in stormy weather (yellow flag) a bargain
must be made, provided landing be at all possible. It is advisable to stipulate
for the landing of luggage and its transport to the hotel for an inclusive
sum (¾–1 p.) and to disregard the noisy importunities of the boatmen
and porters. If need be, the help of the hotel-agents may be invoked.
The traveller should be on his guard against pilfering also. Guides, who
represent themselves as agents for the hotels, also proffer their services,
even during the crossing from Gibraltar, but their attendance generally
makes everything dearer. Besides the fares mentioned, pier-dues are
levied (25 c.; for each package 5 c.).—The custom-house examination at
the town-gate is lenient. A passport is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Tangier</i>, Spanish or French <i>Tanger</i>, Arabic <i>Tanja</i>, capital
of the Moroccan province of <i>El-Fahs</i> or <i>Fahass</i>, the largest commercial
town in the whole country, and the seat of legations from
the great powers, lies picturesquely on the hilly W. bank of a
shallow bay of the Atlantic. Of the 46,270 inhab. 25,000 are
Mohammedans, 12,000 Moroccan Jews, and 9270 foreigners (incl.
7000 Spaniards). The rough and extremely dirty streets of the
old town, above whose white sea of houses peeps here and there
the minaret of a mosque, afford a genuine picture of Oriental life.
Amid the noisy crowds are seen the most widely divergent types,
from the pale yellow Moorish aristocrat to the dark-brown Moroccans
of the south and the black negroes of the Sudan. Their costumes
also are very various. The Mohammedans wear white or
coloured burnous, brown jellâbas, yellow slippers (p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>), and a
coloured turban or red fez (tarbûsh). The Jews wear either European
garb or the regulation black kaftan and fez. Most of the
streets are impracticable for vehicles. The commonest beast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>burden is the donkey; the frequent shout of ‘bâlek’ (take care)
warns foot-passengers to make room. The busiest places are the
quay, whence cattle from the interior are shipped for Gibraltar
and Ceuta, and in the morning the three markets.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although already a Phœnician settlement, <i>Tingis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>) first appears
in history in the Roman period, when it vied with Oppidum Novum
(Ksar el-Kebîr) and Volubilis as one of the chief places in this region.
Augustus conferred on its inhabitants the right of citizenship, and Claudius
made the town a Roman colony. It is unknown when Tangier was founded,
but in the middle ages it fell behind the thriving seaports of Ceuta, Ksar
es-Serîr (p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>), and Arzila. According to Moorish tradition it was founded
by Mulaï Abd es-Slam Buarakia, the patron saint of the town. In 1471
it fell into the hands of the Portuguese, and it belonged to Spain from
1580 to 1640. In 1662 it formed part of the dowry of Catharine of Braganza,
consort of prince Charles (afterwards Charles II. of England), and
thus came into the possession of the English. In 1664, however, the
English were signally defeated by the Moors on the ‘<i>Jews’ River</i>’ (pp. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>,
102), and in 1684 evacuated the town, after demolishing the fortifications
and the pier. Since then the town has belonged to Morocco. The present
fortifications, constructed by English engineers, are mounted with antiquated
guns, and the town-walls date partly from the Portuguese period.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the <i>Muelle Nuevo</i> (Pl. E, 1; new pier, 1907; adm. 25 c.),
we walk past the new harbour for lighters and the granary (Almacen),
and then to the S.W. through the harbour-gate (<i>Bâb
el-Marsâ</i>) into the <span class='sc'>Main Street</span> (Pl. D, C, 2, 3), which ascends
the hill-side in a curve to the Outer Market. Passing the <i>Great
Mosque</i> or <i>Jâma el-Kebîr</i> (Pl. D, 2), with its pretty gateway and
lofty minaret inlaid with tiles, we reach the <b>Inner Market</b>
(<i>Sok ed-Dáyel</i>; Pl. D, 2; Arabic <i>Sûk ed-Dakhl</i>), the centre of
traffic, with the European post-offices (p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>). Higher up, where
the street takes the name of <i>Siiaguin</i>, are situated on the left the
<i>Spanish Catholic Church</i> (Iglesia Español; Pl. C, 3) and the Morocco
<i>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the street is the upper gate of the inner town
(<i>Bâb ed-Dakhl</i>), leading into <i>Los Herradores</i> (Farriers’ Square;
Pl. 8, C, 3), to the left of which, and also connected with the Outer
Market by a gateway, lies the <i>Meat and Vegetable Market</i> (Plaza
de Abastos; Pl. C, 3). From the Farriers’ Square a second gate on
the right leads to the <i>Mercado</i> (Pl. C, 2, 3), an intermediate market-place,
with rows of booths and a caravanserai (<i>Fondak</i>). Passing
through the N. gate (Bâb el-Marshan; Pl. C, 3) and skirting the
town-walls and the <i>Christian Cemetery</i> (Pl. B, 2), we reach, on the
left, the Paseo de Cenarro (Pl. B, A, 2), the new Marshan road, and
(straight on) the Kasba and the old Marshan route (see p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Fez Gate (<i>Bâb el-Fahs</i>; Pl. C, 3) leads into the <b>Outer
Market</b> (<i>Sûk el-Barra</i>; Pl. B, C, 3), which deserves a visit on
market-days (Thursdays and particularly Sundays). In this great
and very uneven plot of ground, adorned with the shrine of <i>Sidi
Makhfî</i> (Meyfi), the patron-saint of the market, we witness a strange
and indescribable scene. Between the rows of salesmen and saleswomen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the latter veiled and clad in white, moves a motley throng
of bargaining and jostling customers, while smaller groups gather
round the jugglers, story-tellers, and snake-charmers (members of
the sect of the Aïssaouas; p. <a href='#Page_373'>373</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. side of the Outer Market the <span class='sc'>Monte Road</span> (Camino
del Monte; Pl. B, A, 3; p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>) leads to the W., past two <i>Mohammedan
Cemeteries</i> (Cementerio de los Moros; Pl. B, A, 2–4) and
the <i>Portuguese Legation</i> (Pl. A, 3), to the (¼ hr.) <i>Villa Sicsu</i>
(comp. Map), with its pretty garden (gate-keeper ½–1 p.).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the gate of this villa a by-road ascends in a curve to
the right to the <b>Marshan</b> (El Marxán; 341 ft.), a plateau to the
N.W. of the town. At the W. end of it, above the Bubana Valley
(see below), lie an estate of the <i>Sherif of Wazzân</i> (Xerif de Uazán)
and a <i>Mohammedan Cemetery</i>. Farther to the E., beyond the
<i>Austrian Legation</i>, we come to a number of square <i>Phœnician
Rock Tombs</i>, now partly used as cisterns, situated on the steep
margin of the coast, which is undermined by the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The walled <b>Kasba</b> (Pl. B, C, 1), on the E. slope of the Marshan,
is the highest and the most curious quarter of the town. Entering
it by the upper gate (<i>Bâb ed-Doulah</i> or <i>Bâb el-Marshan</i>;
Pl. B, 1), we first come to the barracks and the <i>Naham Battery</i>
(Pl. B, 1), where we have a splendid view of the Straits of Gibraltar.
Opposite us is the <i>Rauda</i>, or burial-chapel of the patron saint of
the town (p. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>). A little below is seen the <i>Sultan’s Palace</i> (Pl.
B, C, 1), a good example of late-Moorish architecture, with a fine
colonnaded court, a mosque, and a garden. The square at the lower
end of the Kasba is bordered by the <i>Tesoro</i> (Pl. 10; treasury),
the <i>Mexuar</i> (Pl. 9; law-courts), at the entrance to which the cadi
administers justice from 8 to 11 in the morning, and the <i>State
Prison</i> (Cárcel; visitors admitted), where male prisoners are employed
in basket-making and other work. Near this is a smaller
prison for women.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the <i>Bâb el-Assa</i>, the lower Kasba gate (Pl. C, 1), a steep
footpath, which soon offers a striking *View of the white houses
of Tangier and of the beach, descends to the town.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> We may walk or ride to the S.E., past the <i>Sea Baths</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>), along the beach, which forms an excellent riding-course at low
tide, to the (¾–1 hr.) <i>Roman Bridge</i> across the brook <i>Galeres</i> (Wâd el-Mogoga),
and thence a little inland over the sand-hills (100 ft.) to the
<b>Ruins of Tingis</b> (Arabic <i>Tanja el-Bâlia</i>), where the Roman seaward
gateway is still well preserved. The road then makes a long bend to
the N. to the <i>Torre Blanquilla</i> (243 ft.), an old Moorish battery on <i>Cape
Malabata</i> (p. <a href='#Page_6'>6</a>), 2½–3½ hrs. from Tangier.—Another pleasant ride may
be taken from the shore to the S.W., inland, through orange-groves to
(1¼ hr.) the village of <i>Es-Suani</i>, where we strike the <i>Fez Road</i> (p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>),
by which we may return to the Outer Market.</p>

<p class='c022'>The *Excursion to Cape Spartel, 7½ M. to the W. of Tangier,
takes nearly a day (horses, etc., see p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>; bargain advisable; provisions
should be taken). From the Villa Sicsu (see above) we descend the Monte
road to the <i>Bubana Valley</i>, watered by the little <i>Wâd el-Ihûd</i> (‘Jews’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>River’), ¾ hr. to the W. of Tangier. From the bridge we may go straight
on, and mount direct to the top of the <i>Jebel Kebîr</i> (1070 ft.), which is
overgrown with low underwood, or (more attractive) we may follow the
Monte road to <i>Monte Washington</i>, a colony of charming villas immediately
overlooking the sea, and then, ¾ hr. farther on, rejoin the direct
route. On both routes we enjoy a splendid view of the sea and the Spanish
coast with Cape Trafalgar (p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>). The main road at length descends to
the W. margin of <b>Cape Spartel</b> (Arabic <i>Râs Ishberdil</i>), the ancient <i>Promontorium
Ampelusia</i>, the north-westmost point of Africa. The lighthouse
(312 ft.), built and maintained by the European great powers, at
present the only one on the coast of Morocco (others are projected at
Melilla, Casablanca, Mazagan, Saffi, and Mogador), is visible at sea from
a distance of about 30 M. Near it are a signal-station and a meteorological
station belonging to the nautical observatory of Hamburg.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the cape we may ride along the coast to the (2½ M.) <i>Hercules
Grotto</i>, where excellent grindstones and millstones have been quarried
from time immemorial, or, in returning to Tangier, we may diverge from
the Bubana Valley to visit the <i>Olive Groves</i>, between the Jews’ River
and the Fez road (see below).</p>

<h3 class='c020'>13. From Tangier to Tetuán (<i>Ceuta</i>).</h3>

<p class='c016'>The journey to Tetuán, about 37 M., may be performed (on horseback
or by mule) in one day, but travellers wishing to break their journey
may spend a night at a fondak (see below) where, considering the rough
accommodation, it is best to camp outside (tents and camping-utensils
should be taken from Tangier). An escort is advisable. Or we may go
to Tetuán by a steamer of the <i>Bland Line</i> (usually on Sat. even., in 3 hrs.;
$4), and return thence to Tangier or Gibraltar by the <i>Navigation Mixte</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>; every second Tues.; agent at Tetuán, Salvador Hassan). From
Tangier to Ceuta direct there is a weekly steamer (on Thurs.) of the
<i>Vapores Correos de Africa</i>. For the excursion to Ceuta a passport <i>visé</i>
by the Spanish consul at Tangier or Tetuán is required. A local boat
crosses daily from Ceuta to Algeciras (p. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>) in 2 hrs.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Outer Market we follow the Fez road (Pl. C, 3–5; Camino
de Fez) to the S., passing at some distance from the stone huts of the
Berber villages (<i>Duâr</i>) in the fertile hill-country of the province
of <i>El-Fahs</i>. Nearing the village of <i>Aïn-Dalia</i>, we pass below it,
ride to the S.E. in view of the steep peak of <i>Jebel Zinat</i>, crowned
with the ruined house of Raisuli, and ascend in the fertile valley
of the <i>Wâd Marhar</i> (<i>Tahaddart</i>). Here, on the right, beyond
the hills inhabited by the Berber tribe of the <i>Beni Msaur</i>, we can
sometimes descry in clear weather the distant <i>Jebel Mulaï Abd
es-Slam</i> (5742 ft.), the most sacred mountain in N. Morocco.</p>

<p class='c011'>The track then ascends through remains of cork-tree forest in
the beautiful hill-region of the <i>Wâd Râs</i>. At the top of the pass
(1476 ft.), the watershed between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean,
stands the fondak of <i>Aïn el-Jedida</i>, the largest caravanserai
in N. Morocco (comp. above). The roof-terrace commands a
fine view of the hills around.</p>

<p class='c011'>The track, which soon affords a beautiful *View of Tetuán,
now descends the stony slope to the E. into the valley of the <i>River
Martín</i>, a stream rising on the Jebel Mulaï Abd es-Slam.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span><b>Tetuán</b> (197 ft.; Hot. Dersa, pens. 10 p.; Hot. Calpe, R. 3,
pens. 10 p., plain but good; Hot. Victoria, pens. 6–8 p.; Brit. vice-cons.,
W. S. Bewicke), Arabic <i>Titawân</i>, Berber <i>Tettawên</i>, an interesting
town, containing among its 30,450 inhab. 6000 Jews, 400
Spaniards, and about 500 immigrants from Algeria, lies 7 M. from
the Mediterranean and above the left bank of the River Martín, not
far from the ancient Roman <i>Thamuda</i>. The garden-like environs
are fertile and well watered. With its numerous minarets, its
domed tombs of saints, its town-walls garnished with many towers,
and its loftily placed citadel (Kasba) overshadowed on the N. by
the red sandstone rocks of the <i>Jebel Dersa</i>, it presents a most
charming picture of an Oriental town entirely free from European
disfigurement. The narrow, winding streets recall the ancient part
of Cordova, and the colonnaded courts of the externally plain
Moorish houses resemble the patios of Seville (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>). In the more
regularly built Mellah (Jewish quarter) one is often struck with
the beauty of the Jewish girls and the women’s gold-embroidered
festive attire. Some parts of the town still show traces of the
Spanish siege of 1859–60, which gained for the victorious Marshal
O’Donnell the title of ‘Duke of Tetuán’.</p>

<p class='c011'>The graves in the <i>Jewish Cemetery</i> are sometimes not unlike
the anthropoid sarcophagi of the Phœnicians (comp. p. <a href='#Page_347'>347</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The old <i>Portuguese Watch Tower</i> at <i>Kilallin</i> affords a superb
panorama.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mouth of the River Martín, which is much choked with sand,
forms the harbour of Tetuán, but sea-going vessels have to anchor
in the open roads. The trade of the place is unimportant.</p>

<p class='c016'>A coast-road was constructed by the Spaniards during the Morocco
campaign, connecting Tetuán with Ceuta (23 M.), but now only a track
remains. It leads at first through the coast-plain at the E. base of <i>Jebel
Dersa</i> (see above), and then, beyond the <i>Cabo Negro</i> or <i>Cape Negron</i>
(886 ft.; Arabic <i>Râs et-Tarf</i>), skirts the fertile spurs of the <i>Anjera Mts.</i>
Beyond the Moroccan frontier guard-house, we enter Spanish territory,
protected by a chain of block-houses, and skirt the E. slope of the Jurassic
<i>Sierra Bullones</i> or <i>Apes’ Hill</i> (2809 ft.; Arabic <i>Jebel Mûsa</i>, <i>i. e.</i> Hill of
Moses), where apes abound. This is the highest peak of the Anjera Mts.
and was famed in antiquity as one of the pillars of Hercules (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Ceuta</b> (several small Spanish inns; no photographing allowed), Arabic
<i>Sebta</i>, a town of 10,000 inhab. (of whom 3000 are soldiers), the only important
Spanish possession in Morocco besides Melilla (p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>), lies on a
narrow, flat tongue of land between a spur of the Sierra Bullones, crowned
with the white tomb of a saint, and the strongly fortified peninsula of
<i>Almina</i>, which culminates in the <i>Monte del Acho</i> (637 ft.). Originally
Phœnician, it became a Roman colony, under the name of <i>Ad Septem
Fratres</i> (later <i>Septon</i> or <i>Septa Emporia</i>), and in the middle ages was the
most important and prosperous seaport of N. Morocco. In 1169 it was
the seat, of a Genoese trading station, and in 1415 it fell into the hands
of the Portuguese, from whose time date the ruins of <i>Ceuta la Vieja</i> (old
Ceuta). Since 1580, in spite of repeated attacks by the Moroccans (1694–1720,
1732), it has remained in the uninterrupted possession of Spain,
and it now presents a sadly decayed appearance. The tunny and sardine
fisheries here are very thriving.</p>

There are also the small cargo-boats of the Genoese <i>Servizio Italo-Spagnuolo</i>,
of <i>Rius &#38; Torres</i> of Barcelona, and others. The small boats of the <i>Bland
Line</i> ply between Tangier and Larash once or twice weekly. The Canary
Line of the <i>Compañía Trasatlántica</i> touches once monthly at Tangier (if
required also at Casablanca and Mazagan).—Landing and embarkation in
lighters at most of the intermediate ports is often impracticable for weeks
together, especially in winter. Harbours are in course of construction at
Larash and Casablanca, and one at Saffi is projected.—Tangier, Rabât,
Casablanca, and Mogador have wireless telegraph stations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Along the <b>Ocean Seaboard</b> of Morocco (about 835 M. to
<i>Cape Juby</i>) navigation is often impeded by gales, sandbanks, and
fogs. The seaports lie mostly at the mouths of rivers or in small
and shallow open bays.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Steamers</span> round the sandstone rocks of <i>Cape Spartel</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>) and steer to the S.W., at some distance from the land, above
which in clear weather are seen the <i>Rîf Mts.</i>, with the Jebel Habib
(2990 ft.) and the Jebel Mulaï Abd es-Slam (p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the coast-plain of <i>El-Gharbia</i> we next observe, on a terrace
abraded by the sea, the decayed little seaport-town of <i>Arzila</i>, the
Phœnician <i>Zilis</i>, Rom. <i>Colonia Zilis Constantia</i>, with a ruinous
town-wall of the Portuguese period.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the <i>Haffet el-Beida</i>, a spur of the hill-region of <i>Sahel</i>,
once famed for its cork-tree groves and its fertility, we near the
broad mouth of the <i>Lukkus</i> or <i>El-Kus</i>, the <i>Lix</i> of antiquity, and
obtain a splendid view of the white sandstone walls and the castellated
Kasba of Larash.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Larash</b>, also called <i>Larache</i> or <i>Laraiche</i>, Arabic <i>El-Araïsh</i>
(Hot. Lukkus, on the river-bank; landing or embarkation 1 p.; Brit.
vice-cons., L. Forde), a somewhat dirty town of 13,220 inhab. (incl.
3000 Jews and 200 Europeans), one of the chief seaports of Morocco,
lies on the left bank of the Lukkus, about 100 ft. above the river.
The total exports and imports are valued at 18 million francs. In
the 16th cent. the town was an important Portuguese centre of trade,
and in 1580–1689 it belonged to Spain. It then became a war-harbour
and the headquarters of the pirates of Morocco, and was
fruitlessly attacked by the French in their disastrous expedition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of 1765, and by an Austrian squadron in 1829. The former harbour,
which was rendered inaccessible to vessels of larger draught by the
bar obstructing it and the shallowness of the river-mouth, is being
superseded by a new harbour now under construction. The town-walls,
the moats, the coast-batteries, and the small fortifications on
the S. bank of the river date from the Spanish occupation.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the landing-place on the N.E. margin of the town we
pass through the harbour-gate into the spacious <i>Inner Market</i>
(Sûk ed-Dakhl), with the old <i>Spanish Merchants’ Hall</i> (Fondak
el-Essbenyoli) and arcades lined with shops. Gateways lead thence
to the N.W. to the picturesque <i>Kasba</i> (no admission), and to the
S.E. to the <i>Government Palace</i> (Dâr el-Makhzen). The <i>Chief
Mosque</i> was once the Spanish cathedral, and several of the dwelling-houses
are still Spanish in character.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the Bâb el-Khemis lies the extensive <i>Outer Market</i>
(Thurs.). Excellent oranges and other fruit are grown in the beautiful
gardens around.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some Roman ruins, relics of the old town of <i>Lixus</i> (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), now
overgrown with brushwood, lie on the <i>Jebel Tshemmish</i>, a low hill on
the right bank of the Lukkus, about 1½ hr. from Larash (best reached
by boat).</p>

<p class='c009'>As the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> proceeds there appears on the horizon a range
of sand-hills, 31 M. long, which separates the Sebu bay from the
sea. This bay (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>) is now dry land, with the exception of two
shallow lakes (<i>Merja ez-Zerga</i> and <i>Merja Râs ed-Dôra</i>) and
large tracts of swamp. To the E. rises the <i>Jebel Sarsar</i> (1805 ft.),
near Ksar el-Kebîr. On the left bank of the <i>Sebu</i> (ancient <i>Subur</i>),
near the <i>Mamora Forest</i>, the largest plantation of cork-trees in
Morocco, lies <i>Mehedia</i> or <i>Mehdiya</i> (pop. 500), a thriving seaport
during the sway of the Almohades, but now fallen to utter decay.
A fine Moorish town-gate of the 12th cent. and many ruins of the
Portuguese period may be visited.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Rabât</b> (Hot. Ignace, R. 2, pens. 10 fr., Hot. Alegría, Spanish,
both unpretending; Brit. vice-cons., A. H. Cross; Engl. Church service),
or <i>Rbât</i>, situated in the Tell (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>) on the left bank of the
<i>Bu Regreg</i>, 138 M. from Tangier, is one of the sultan’s residences
and vies with Tetuán (p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>) as a most interesting coast-town. Its
population together with that of Salee (p. <a href='#Page_106'>106</a>) is 47,140 inhab.,
incl. 3000 Jews and 100 Europeans. As it is the ‘key of Morocco’,
where the caravan routes from Tangier, Fez, and Casablanca (Marakesh)
converge, and is also exposed to the attacks of the turbulent
inland tribes of the <i>Zemmûr</i> and <i>Zaïr</i>, it has been fortified
with an inner and two outer walls. A <i>Fort</i>, built in 1888–92, defends
the entrance to the harbour, now much choked with sand.
The difficulty of landing (charge for each passenger 2½ p.) has
caused the trade of the place (imports and exports about 8 million
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>francs) to decline and to fall behind that of Tangier, Larash, and
Mogador. Several of the industries have long been famous (carpet-making,
wool-weaving, woodwork, saffian leather, etc.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Founded in 1197, opposite to Salee (see below), by the Almohade
Yakûb ibn Yûsuf (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>), the still prosperous town is noted for
its well-educated population, mostly Moorish, and its genuine
Moroccan character. The dwelling-houses, in the Andalusian-Moorish
style, vie in their internal architecture with those of
Tetuán. Noteworthy are also the old town-gates, the portal of the
<i>Kasba</i>, with the barracks of the Udaia, and the decayed <i>Medersa</i>
(school of the learned), with its picturesque colonnaded *Court.
At the S.E. angle of the town, not far from the harbour-gate and
the Mohammedan cemetery, is the <i>Mellah</i> or Jews’ quarter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the <i>Bâb el-Hâd</i>, on the W. side of the inner town-wall,
is the Jewish burial-ground, adjoining the <i>Sûk el-Hâd</i>, or
Sunday market, the most important cattle-market in the whole
country, supplied chiefly by the Zemmûr, Zaïr, and Zaiân tribes.—On
the terrace of the coast, by the W. outer wall (reached also
from the Bâb el-Alû by the road past the Christian cemetery),
stands the handsome, but now disused sultan’s palace of <i>El-Kebibât</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the Jews’ quarter, and not far from the *Bâb Shellah
(1178–84) with its two octagonal towers, we see rising amidst
orchards, above the Bu Regreg, the conspicuous *<i>Hassan Tower</i>,
the great landmark of Rabât. This was once the minaret of a
mosque, erected, according to tradition, by Jâbir (p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>) for Yakûb
ibn Yûsuf in 1197, but now entirely destroyed saving a few
columns and fragments of masonry. The unfinished tower, with
its notched arches and ornamentation in relief style, is 145 ft. high.</p>

<p class='c011'>About 1 M. to the S. of the town, near the outer walls, is the
<i>Dâr el-Makhzen</i>, a second palace of the sultan, with the burial-mosque
of Mohammed XVII. and Mulaï Hassan (1873–94), and
a beautiful garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near this is the S.E. outer gateway. Among the neighbouring
hills, beyond a small Mohammedan burial-ground, is a walled and
turreted square enclosing the ancient town of *<i>Shellah</i>, the mouldering
ruins of which are overgrown with rank vegetation; we find
here an excellent well. In the dilapidated burial-mosque repose
the Almohade Abû Yakûb (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>), the Merinide Ali V. (d. 1351),
and other sovereigns.—A little way off, on the S. margin of the
swampy and malarious river-flats, are famous orange-gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>A ferry connects Rabât with the antiquated town of <i>Salee</i>,
<i>Saleh</i>, or <i>Slâ</i>, the <i>Sala</i> of the Carthaginians and Romans, which,
down to recent times, was like Larash one of the most dreaded
haunts of pirates (‘Salee rovers’) and one of the worst slave-markets
in all Morocco. The town shows every sign of decay; but its
gates, especially the Bâb el-Ansera (now walled up), with its two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>towers, the ruinous gate of the cemetery, and the domed tombs of
saints, all present a most fascinating architectural picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>Proceeding on her course the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> skirts a monotonous,
treeless coast, broken only by the mouths of a few small rivers,
with here and there a poor village. One of these villages is
<i>Fedalah</i> (in the middle ages <i>Afdalah</i>), once a thriving little
seaport, which was temporarily occupied by the Spaniards in 1773.
On a headland much exposed to N. winds, 190 M. from Tangier,
lies—</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Casablanca.</b>—Passengers are conveyed from the steamers, which
anchor in the open roads to the N.E. of the town, to the new quay by

<p class='c009'><i>Casablanca</i>, Arabic <i>Dâr el-Beida</i> (‘the white house’), a town
of 31,700 inhab. (incl. 2500 French and as many Spaniards), was
founded in the 16th cent. by the Portuguese as <i>Casa Branca</i> on
the ruins of the ancient (Phœnician?) town of <i>Anfa</i>. The place
appears in mediæval Venetian charts as <i>Níffe</i> or <i>Anafe</i>, but it
was abandoned by the Moors in 1468. The town was destroyed in
1755 by an earthquake simultaneous with that of Lisbon; it was
not rebuilt till the 19th cent., and is now the most important outlet
in the country for Moroccan commodities (exports and imports in
1909 ca. 25½ million fr.). To this centre are brought cattle from
the neighbouring provinces, from the remoter districts of Tadla
(or Tedla), and from the steppes of the Central Atlas, while the
fertile region of Shâuya supplies it with grain and wool. Thanks
to the peace and security which the French troops of occupation
have restored trade has steadily increased.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town, which is still enclosed by a wall of defence built in
the Portuguese period, lies on a terrace of Devonian sandstone
(E. side) and slate (W. side), in which the surf has worn a small
shallow bay. The harbour thus formed is to be protected by a
breakwater (in course of construction) which will make landing
and embarking in all weathers possible (comp. above).—From the
harbour we pass through the Waterport Gate into the main street
of the <i>Medina</i> or Mohammedan business quarter. Most of the foreign
consulates and banks and the international Anfa Club are
situated in this street. Just off it are the British Consulate and
the British Post Office, while higher up is the new French post-office.
The <i>Mellah</i>, or Jewish quarter, lies on the S. side of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Near the Bâb es-Sûk, or S.E. gate, is the *<i>Market</i> (Sûk; comp,
p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>), and a little beyond it are the warehouses of the foreign
merchants.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the W. quarter (<i>Tnaquer</i>), which down to 1907 consisted chiefly
of the reed-huts of the lower-class workmen, similar to those outside the
S.W. gate (<i>Bâb Marâkesh</i>), modern stone dwellings have sprung up and
public grounds also have been laid out. Farther out are the wooden barracks
of the French and Spanish troops of occupation. On the low hills
to the E. and S.E. are the new French forts ‘Provost’ and ‘Ihler’.</p>

<p class='c009'>A considerable way beyond Casablanca the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> passes the
mouth of the <i>Um er-Rebîa</i> (see below), on the left bank of which
is Asimmûr, and a little farther on it casts anchor in the open
roads of Mazagan, far outside the little harbour, which dates from
the Portuguese period. (Landing or embarkation 3 p.)</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Mazagan</b> (Hôt. de l’Univers, pens. 6–8 fr.; Hôt. du Commerce,
same charges; Brit. vice-cons., T. G. Spinney; pop. 25,500, incl.
3000 Jews and about 500 Europeans), formerly called <i>El-Brîja</i>
by the Moroccans, now <i>El-Jedida</i> (‘the new’), 250 M. from Tangier,
lies on a terrace on the W. shore of a large bay which is now much
choked with sand. It was founded by the Portuguese in 1506, held
by them down to 1769, and was their last possession in Morocco;
but it long remained a place of no importance. The old town, square
in shape, protected from the surf by a chain of cliffs, and altered
after 1769, is still enclosed by its Portuguese wall of defence,
which is 29 ft. thick at places. Several houses bearing Portuguese
coats-of-arms and the <i>Palace of the Inquisition</i> in the N. angle of
the town recall the Christian domination. In recent times Mazagan
has developed into the chief seaport of Marakesh. The great Thursday
market, held on the W. side of the town, and the granaries on
the S. side afford an idea of the extent of its trade (imports and
exports being estimated, when crops are good, at 20 million fr. per
annum). The climate is considered very healthy.</p>

<p class='c016'>The alcanna shrub (Lawsonia inermis) abounds in the environs. From
its leaves is prepared the brownish-red <i>henna</i>, used for colouring the
finger-nails. This ancient custom still prevails among both Mohammedans
and Jews in N. Africa.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> The picturesquely situated town of <b>Azimmûr</b>, about
12½ M. to the E., lies on the <i>Um er-Rebîa</i> or <i>Morbêya</i>, the <i>Asama</i> of
antiquity, a stream which separates the Shâuya region from the Dukkâla
The town, with its 10,000 inhab., incl. 1000 Jews, contains the shrine of
Mulaï bu Shaïb, much visited by pilgrims, and is environed with beautiful
gardens of pomegranates, oranges, and figs. On the same river lie the
orange-groves of <i>Mhiula</i>.—To the S.W. one may ride along the coast,
past the <i>Zâuya Mulaï Abdallah</i> and the ruins of the Roman town of <i>Tit</i>,
to Cabo Blanco (see below).</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Mazagan we pass the <i>Cabo Blanco</i> (230 ft.; Arabic
<i>Jerf el-Asfâr</i>) and then the <i>Walediya Lake</i>, ca. 40 M. long.
Farther on, from the abrupt coast juts out <i>Cape Cantin</i> (450 ft.;
Arabic <i>Râs el-Hûdik</i>), well known to mariners as a landmark,
whence the coast runs S. to the Tensift (p. <a href='#Page_109'>109</a>). We call next at—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span><b>Saffi</b> (Hot. Llamas; Brit. vice-cons., G. B. Hunot; pop. 19,750,
incl. 2500 Jews), called also <i>Safi</i> or <i>Asfi</i>, 350 M. from Tangier. The
harbour is inadequately sheltered from the W. and S.W. gales by a
narrow neck of land and two cliffs, and its entrance is obstructed
by a sandbank. (Landing or embarkation 1 p.) Saffi is the capital
of the fertile region of <i>Abda</i>, noted for its horse-breeding, and
girdled with black soil (comp. p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>) fertile to a breadth of 37 M.
at places. It lies picturesquely on a lofty chalk plateau, in an
almost semicircular bay, amidst woods and green pastures, but is
haunted by fever in summer. Prior to the foundation of Mazagan
and Mogador it was the chief port of Marakesh, and like Agâdir
(p. <a href='#Page_110'>110</a>) was one of the most important harbours of S. Morocco, but
its trade, mostly in European hands, has now fallen off (total about
10 million francs). The chief industry of the place, which has
given its name to Saffian leather, is now the manufacture of pottery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Close to the harbour lies the <i>Jewish Quarter</i>, and behind it
is the <i>Medina</i> or Mohammedan quarter, both squalid. Adjoining
the latter is the Spanish Catholic church. The picturesque <i>Citadel</i>
at the E. end of the old town and the town-walls are of Portuguese
origin. The Sûk, or market, is in the S. suburb of <i>Rabbât</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> next sights, near the mouth of the <i>Tensift</i>, the
<i>Jebel el-Hadid</i> (2182 ft.; ‘iron-mountain’; p. <a href='#Page_110'>110</a>), already famed
in Punic times for its iron-ore, the only considerable hill on the
coast between this and Mogador. The vessel rounds <i>Cape Hadid</i>,
the S. limit of the fertile coast-plain, sighting in the distance the
spurs of the <i>Great Atlas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>), and soon reaches (410 M. from
Tangier; landing or embarkation 2½ p.) the seaport of—</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Mogador</b> (Hôt. Royal, English; Palm Tree Hotel, 2½ M. to
the S. of the town, prettily situated, good; Brit. vice-cons., H. B.
Johnstone; U. S. cons. agent, G. Broome; Engl. Church service),
called in Arabic <i>Es-Sueïra</i> also, with 24,350 inhab., incl. 12,000
Jews and a good many French, English, Spanish, and other Europeans.
The new town with its straight lines of streets was erected
in 1760–70 under Sultan Mulaï Sidi Mohammed on the site of
<i>Mogator</i>, which was destroyed in 1755 by the same earthquake as
that of Lisbon. In 1844 the town was stormed by French marines.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mogador lies in 31° 31′ N. lat. and 9° 60′ W. long., on a flat spit
of land, bounded on the W. by a small lake, beyond which rises
a great range of sand-hills, at places 427 ft. high and 3¼ M. in
breadth. To the S.W. a chain of cliffs and the rocky islet of <i>Mogador</i>,
the only island on the coast of Morocco, form the harbour,
which is much exposed to the sea-winds. The N. entrance to the
harbour, between the town and the island, is about 825 yds. broad
and 45 ft. deep; the broad S. entrance, opposite the mouth of the
<i>Wâd Kseb</i>, is only 13 ft. in depth. Mogador serves as a port for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the adjacent provinces of <i>Shiâdma</i> (or <i>Shedma</i>), <i>Haha</i>, and <i>Mtûga</i>,
as well as a mart for goods from the <i>Sûs</i> (see below). It is the
stronghold of Judaism in Morocco, as the Jews control the inland
trade with Marakesh, and it is only of late that they have had European
rivals in the ocean traffic. The total exports and imports
amount to about 17 million francs.</p>

<p class='c011'>We land not far from the <i>Harbour Battery</i>, mounted with antiquated
guns, and proceed first to the <i>Kasba</i> quarter, where the
governor’s house, the chief mosque, a synagogue, and the Spanish
church are situated. From the Meshwâr, the principal square in
the Kasba, a broad street leads to the <i>Medina</i>, the Mohammedan
quarter, where a number of Europeans and wealthy Jews also
reside. Here, in the centre of the town, is the <i>Sûk</i>, famed for the
native copper wares, besides various goods from Marakesh, which
are sold there. Beyond the market, in the N.E. angle of the town,
is the <i>Mellah</i>, an extremely dirty quarter, with narrow streets,
inhabited by the poorer Jews.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Bâb Marâkesh, the S.E. gate, we may follow the conduit,
at first along the embankment between the bay of the harbour and the
lake, and then past the <i>Kubba of Sidi Mogdul</i>, the local saint, to the
winding valley of the <i>Wâd Kseb</i>. Here rises a ruinous <i>Palace of the
Sultan</i>, and beyond the sand-hills lies the sadly neglected <i>Sultan’s
Garden</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>The finest point in the wooded inland region near Mogador, which
abounds in game, is the valley of <i>Aïn el-Hajar</i> (‘rock-spring’), 15½ M.
to the N.E. From the Bâb Asfi, the N.E. town-gate, the route leads
past the Christian and the large Jewish cemeteries, and follows the Saffi
caravan-track along the coast, where at low tide it is pleasanter to ride
on the beach. After about 2 hrs. we cross the hill to the E., where in
the extensive growth of underwood are seen numerous argan-trees
(Argania sideroxylon), the kernels of whose fruit yield a table-oil resembling
that of the olive.—From Aïn el-Hajar we may in clear weather
ascend the <i>Jebel el-Hadid</i> (p. <a href='#Page_109'>109</a>), which rises to the N.; on the summit
(2182 ft.) is a chapel dedicated to <i>Sidi Yakûb</i>, whence in the far distance
we may descry the Great Atlas.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the S. of Mogador lies the hilly region of <i>Haha</i>, skirting the
base of the Great Atlas, and rich in olives and argan-trees, through which
a rough caravan-route, running inland from <i>Cape Tafetneh</i> and passing
<i>Cape Gîr</i>, leads to <b>Agâdir</b> (pop. 2500). This was formerly the seaport
for the region of Sûs (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>), and was even the goal of caravans from
the Sudan district, but since the building of Mogador has lost all European
trade. In the 16th cent. Agâdir, under the name of <i>Santa Cruz</i>, was the
southmost possession of the Portuguese in Morocco.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>15. From Gibraltar to Genoa.</h3>

<h4 class='c023'>a. Through the Balearic Sea.</h4>

<p class='c016'>1000 M. <span class='sc'>Steamboats</span> (see ‘Gibraltar Chronicle’, and comp. pp. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>, 114).
<i>White Star Line</i> (from New York or Boston), two or three times monthly;
<i>North German Lloyd</i> (from Southampton), monthly; <i>Cunard Line</i> (from
New York), occasionally; <i>Lloyd Sabaudo</i> (from S. America), monthly.</p>

<p class='c009'>On leaving <i>Gibraltar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>) the steamer enters the open Mediterranean
and steers to the E.N.E., generally at an accelerated
speed, as far as Cape Palos, owing to the strong current flowing
in from the Atlantic (p. <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>). Looking back, farther on, we enjoy in
clear weather a splendid *View of the Straits, and especially of the
coast of Morocco from Cape Spartel to the <i>Punta de la Almina</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>), from which peep the white houses of <i>Ceuta</i>. The Rîf Mts.
(<i>Jebel Beni Hassan</i>, p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>) also remain visible for a time.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish coast with the <i>Sierra Bermeja</i>, the <i>Sierra de
Mijas</i>, and the <i>Punta de Calaburras</i> (lighthouse) gradually recedes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Far away to the left is the bay of <i>Málaga</i>. Off <i>Cape Sacratif</i>,
with its lighthouse, we obtain a grand *View of the <i>Sierra Nevada</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_49'>49</a>), in front of which rise the almost entirely barren <i>Sierra
de Almijara</i>, <i>Sierra Contraviesa</i>, and <i>Sierra de Gádor</i>. Near the
<i>Punta del Sabinal</i> (lighthouse) opens the broad semicircular bay
of <i>Almería</i>; in the foreground rise the bare hills of <i>Cabo de Gata</i>
(1683 ft.; lighthouse), with the <i>Puerto Genovés</i> beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steering now to the N.E., we pass the <i>Punta de Loma Pelada</i>,
backed by the <i>Frailes</i> (‘monks’), two huge pyramids of rock; then
the <i>Mesa de Roldán</i>, the bay of <i>Cartagena</i> (p. <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>), the <i>Cabo
Tiñoso</i>, <i>Cape Palos</i>, and the island of <i>Hormiga Grande</i>, all with
lighthouses. Nearing the Balearic Islands, we may descry to the
left, in very clear weather, the coast-plain of <i>Murcia</i> and even the
distant hills of <i>Alicante</i>, as far as <i>Cabo de la Nao</i> and <i>Mongó</i>. The
vessel now steers round the <i>Balearic Islands</i> (see Baedeker’s Spain
and Portugal), on the S.E. side if storms in the Gulf of Lions are
expected, but usually through the bay of <i>Valencia</i> and the <i>Balearic
Sea</i>. In this case we pass close to the island of <i>Iviza</i>, which is
flanked on the S.W. (in front of the <i>Atalayasa</i>; 1559 ft.) by the
bold rocky islet of <i>Vedrá</i>, and on the W. by the <i>Bleda Islets</i> and
<i>Conejera</i> (with a lighthouse). On the N.E. point of Iviza is the
lighthouse of <i>Punta Grosa</i>. In the foreground, farther on, appear
the bold limestone slopes of the island of <i>Dragonera</i>, with a lighthouse
(1191 ft.) visible for 40 M. round. Beyond it is <i>Mallorca</i>,
or <i>Majorca</i>, the largest of the Balearic Islands, whose barren
mountains, culminating in the <i>Puig Mayor</i> (4741 ft.) in the centre,
are visible to their full extent beyond the little port of <i>Soller</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From <i>Cape Formentor</i> (lighthouse), at the N.E. point of Majorca,
the steamer proceeds due N.E. to the <i>Ile du Levant</i> or <i>du
Titan</i> (lighthouse, visible for nearly 40 M. round), the eastmost of
the <i>Iles d’Hyères</i> (p. <a href='#Page_133'>133</a>), which flank the coast of Provence. The
island of <i>Porquerolles</i> also, the westmost of the group, is visible.
In favourable weather the *Voyage through the <i>Ligurian Sea</i> affords
delightful views. The steamers vary their course, but usually steer
towards Cape Ferrat near Villefranche, past <i>Cape Camarat</i> (lighthouse),
the beautiful double bay of <i>Cannes</i> (with the <i>Iles de Lérins</i>
opposite to it), and the <i>Cap d’Antibes</i>. On a clear day Nice is visible
in the distance. We then skirt the <i>Riviera di Ponente</i> (p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>),
passing Ventimiglia, Oneglia, and Albenga, backed by the <i>Maritime</i>
and the <i>Ligurian Alps</i>, snow-clad in winter and spring. On the
picturesque coast between Nice and Bordighera the scenery changes
rapidly. After the little bay of <i>Villefranche</i> (<i>Villafranca</i>), with
<i>Cape Ferrat</i> (lighthouse), come <i>Beaulieu</i>, the grey rock village of
<i>Eze</i>, close under the Grande-Corniche, and <i>La Turbie</i>, overtopped by
the forts behind. We next sight the rock of <i>Monaco</i>, with its cathedral
and huge marine museum, while among the houses of the little
principality may be seen the less conspicuous casino of <i>Monte Carlo</i>.
Beyond the olive-clad <i>Cape Martin</i> appears the bay of <i>Mentone</i>,
with its superb circus of mountains, then <i>Cape Mórtola</i>, the Italian
frontier-town of <i>Ventimiglia</i>, and, beyond the ravine of the <i>Roja</i>,
the little town of <i>Bordighera</i>, with its cape and its dense olive and
palm groves. Next come <i>Ospedaletti</i>, overlooked by the loftily-situated
little town of <i>Coldirodi</i>, and <i>San Remo</i>, on a broad bay
bounded by <i>Capo Nero</i> and <i>Capo Verde</i>. The coast is now less
attractive till we are off <i>Porto Maurizio</i>, a provincial capital
picturesquely situated on a headland, and approach <i>Oneglia</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Near <i>Cape Berta</i> we gradually leave the coast, pass <i>Cape Mele</i>,
with its lighthouse (742 ft.) and Marconi station for wireless telegraphy,
and steer across the *<i>Gulf of Genoa</i>. On the left lie <i>Laigueglia</i>,
<i>Alassio</i>, and, beyond the fissured island of <i>Gallinaria</i>,
the little town of <i>Albenga</i>. Next, on a semicircular coast-plain,
lie the villages of <i>Loano</i> and <i>Finale Marina</i>, and a little beyond
them rises the <i>Capo di Noli</i>. Beyond <i>Cape Vado</i> we overlook
the bay of the industrial seaport of <i>Savona</i>, as far as the headland
of <i>Portofino</i> (p. <a href='#Page_134'>134</a>). In the background rise the <i>Apennines</i> and
the <i>Apuan Alps</i> (p. <a href='#Page_134'>134</a>), snow-capped in winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steering through the <i>Avamporto</i> and the <i>Porto Nuovo</i>, we
obtain a superb *View of <i>Genoa</i>, rising in a semicircle on the
hill-side.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Genoa.</b>—<span class='sc'>Arrival by Sea.</span> The passenger-steamers land at the
<i>Ponte Federico Guglielmo</i> (Pl. A, B, 3; with custom-house, post, telegraph,
and railway offices) in the <i>Porto</i> or inner harbour. Failing room at that
pier, they anchor near it (landing by boat, with luggage, 1 fr.; embarkation

<p class='c009'><i>Genoa</i>, Ital. <i>Genŏva</i>, French <i>Gênes</i>, a city of 156,000 inhab.,
was a republic and a great naval power in the middle ages, rivalling
Venice, but declined after the 16th cent.; in 1797 it became
the capital of Napoleon’s ‘Ligurian Republic’, and since 1815 has
belonged to the kingdom of Sardinia which is now merged in that
of Italy. Next to Marseilles it is the greatest of Mediterranean seaports.
The exports and imports in 1908 amounted to 6.4 million
tons, and the tonnage of shipping to 14.4 millions.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the pier, either the Ponte Federico Guglielmo or the
Ponte Andrea Doria (p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>), we cross the harbour-rails to the
<i>Palazzo Doria</i> (Pl. A, B, 2), once presented by the republic to
Andrea Doria (1468–1560), the famous admiral of Charles V.,
and enter the <span class='sc'>Piazza del Principe</span> (Pl. B, 2; tramway, see p. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>),
with its handsome bronze monument to the <i>Marchese Deferrari</i>,
<i>Duke of Galliera</i> (d. 1876), to whose generosity Genoa is partly
indebted for its new quays (1877–95).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Via Andrea Doria leads hence to the E. to the <span class='sc'>Piazza
Acquaverde</span> (Pl. B, C, 2), the square in front of the <i>Railway
Station</i>, where, amid palms, rises a monument to <i>Columbus</i>, who
was probably born at Genoa in 1451 (d. at Valladolid in 1506).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S.E. from this piazza runs a narrow line of streets, the
chief artery of traffic, adorned with superb late-Renaissance edifices,
built chiefly by <i>Galeazzo Alessi</i> (1512–72), named Via Balbi, Via
Cairóli, and Via Garibaldi, and ending at the Piazza Fontane Marose.
Several of the palaces are well worth seeing, especially for
the sake of their grand staircases.</p>

<p class='c011'>No. 10, on the right side of the <span class='sc'>Via Balbi</span>, is the <i>Palazzo Reale</i>
(Pl. C, 3), built after 1650 for the Durazzo family, and purchased
in 1817 for the royal house of Sardinia. No. 5, on the left, is the
<b>Palazzo dell’Università</b> (Pl. D, 2, 3), begun by Bart. Bianco
in 1623 as a Jesuit school. The *Court and the staircases are considered
the finest in Genoa.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on, to the right, No. 4 is the <i>Palazzo Balbi Senárega</i>;
No. 1, on the left, is the <span class='sc'>Palazzo Durazzo-Pallavicini</span> (Pl.
D, 3), both by Bart. Bianco. The picture-gallery in the latter (adm.,
see above) contains portraits by Rubens and Van Dyck, painted
during their visits to Genoa.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>We cross the Piazza dell’Annunziata (Pl. D, 3) with the handsome
baroque church of that name on the left, and the small Piazza
della Zecca (Pl. D, E, 3; funicular to Castellaccio, p. <a href='#Page_117'>117</a>), and then
follow the Via Cairóli (Pl. D, E, 4) to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<span class='sc'>Via Garibaldi</span> (Pl. E, 4), which is flanked with numerous palaces.
No. 13, on the left, is the <b>Palazzo Bianco</b>; No. 18, on the
right, the <b>Palazzo Rosso</b>; both once belonged to the <i>Brignole-Sale</i>
family, but were bequeathed to the city by the Marchesa
Brignole-Sale (d. 1889), widow of the Duca di Galliera (p. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>),
and converted into the two galleries named Brignole-Sale (adm.,
see p. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>). Most of the other palaces were designed by Gal. Alessi.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza Fontane Marose (Pl. F, 4, 5) the short Via Carlo
Felice leads to the S.W. to the <span class='sc'>Piazza Deferrari</span> (Pl. E, 5, 6), the
centre of the city and focus of most of the tramway-lines (p. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>).
The <span class='sc'>Accadémia di Belle Arti</span> (Pl. E, F, 6), on the E. side of the
Piazza, contains the valuable <i>Museo Chiossone</i> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>),
a collection of Japanese and Chinese works of art.</p>

<p class='c016'>The busy <span class='sc'>Via Roma</span> (Pl. F, 5) leads to the N.E. from the Piazza
Deferrari, past (right) the <i>Galleria Mazzini</i>, to the Piazza Corvetto
(Pl. F, G, 5), adjoining which, on the left, on an old bastion is the <i>Villetta
Dinegro</i> (Pl. F, 4; 242 ft.; fine views), a beautiful public park.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the S.E. side of the Piazza Deferrari, where the new buildings
of the <i>Exchange</i> (Borsa) and the <i>Post Office</i> are in progress (Pl. E, F, 6),
runs the broad new <span class='sc'>Via Venti Settembre</span> (Pl. F-H, 6, 7), the favourite
promenade of the citizens, leading to the <i>Bisagno Valley</i> and the <i>Stazione
Orientate</i> (p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>). Immediately before we reach the street-viaduct we
may turn to the right, cross the Piazza Ponticello (Pl. F, 6, 7), and ascend
the Via Fieschi to *<i>Santa Maria di Carignano</i> (Pl. E, 8; 172 ft.), built
by Gal. Alessi. The gallery of the dome (249 steps; sacristan 25 c.) is a
splendid point of view. The Via Nino Bixio and Via Corsica (Pl. E, F, 8, 9)
lead thence to the—</p>

<p class='c022'>*<b>Via di Circonvallazione a Mare</b>, skirting the coast on the site
of the old town-ramparts, named Via Odone and Corso Aurelio Saffi (Pl.
E-H, 9, 10; tramway No. 4, see p. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>From the S.W. angle of the Piazza Deferrari the short Via Sellai
leads to the <span class='sc'>Piazza Umberto Primo</span> (Pl. E, 6). On its N. side rises
the old <i>Palazzo Ducale</i>, or palace of the doges (telegraph-office),
approached by a handsome flight of steps. On the S.E. side is the
ornate Jesuit church of <i>Sant’ Ambrogio</i>, containing a Presentation
in the Temple and the Miracles of St. Ignatius by <i>Rubens</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza Umberto Primo the busy <span class='sc'>Via San Lorenzo</span> leads
to the N.W., past the <b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. E, 5, 6; <i>San Lorenzo</i>),
dating from the 12–17th cent. (in the left aisle the fine early-Renaissance
chapel of San Giovanni Battista), back to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Harbour.</span> Following the tramway to the right to the Piazza
Raibetta, we observe on the left, between that piazza and the Piazza
Caricamento, the Gothic <i>Palazzo di San Giorgio</i>, once the seat of
the great merchants’ bank of that name. Beyond the Piazza Caricamento
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the noisy Via Carlo Alberto (Pl. D, C, 4–2) leads to the N.
past the <i>Darsena</i>, once the naval harbour, to the Piazza Principe
and to the piers, affording a glimpse at the harbour traffic.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza della Zecca (p. <a href='#Page_116'>116</a>) a <span class='sc'>Funicular Tramway</span>
(50 c.) ascends every 10 min. to <i>San Nicolò</i> (Pl. E, 1; change
cars) and *<b>Castellaccio</b>, loftily situated. At the terminus (about
1025 ft.; Ristorante Beregardo, déj. 2½, D. 4 fr., commended)
there is a splendid view of the Bisagno Valley with the Campo
Santo (see below). About ½ M. to the N.W. rises the old fort of
<i>Castellaccio</i> (1254 ft.), which commands an admirable survey of
Genoa and the coast from Savona (p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>) to the headland of Portofino
(p. <a href='#Page_134'>134</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the rocky <i>Capo del Faro</i>, between Genoa and San Pier
d’Arena, rises the <i>Lanterna</i>, a great <b>Lighthouse</b>, 230 ft. high,
from the foot of which we obtain another extensive *View. Tramway
as far as the tunnel (No. 3; p. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza Deferrari a tramway (No. 5) leads by the Piazza
Manin (Pl. I, 4) to the N.E. to the <b>Campo Santo</b> or <i>Cimitero di
Staglieno</i>; which rises above the Val Bisagno on the N. bank.—We
may take the tramway or a motor-omnibus also to the <i>Lido
d’Albáro</i>, a popular resort and sea-bathing place below the road
to Sturla and Nervi.</p>

<p class='c016'>Favourite excursions from Genoa are (tramways Nos. 6 and 3) to
<b>Nervi</b>, 7½ M. to the E., on the Pisa line, and to <b>Pegli</b>, 6¼ M. to the W.,
on the Ventimiglia line. Nervi has a beautiful marine parade, and at
Pegli is the <i>Villa Pallavicini</i>. (The entrance of the villa is immediately
to the left of the exit from the rail. station; adm. on week-days except
Frid. and festivals, 10–3; on Sun. and holidays 9–2; fee 1 fr.)—A superb
view is obtained from the <b>Portofino-Kulm</b> (1477 ft.; Hôt.-Restaur., déj.
5, D. 7 fr.), on the Monte di Portofino (p. <a href='#Page_134'>134</a>). Motor-omn. direct from

<p class='c011'>After many hours’ steaming we next sight the uninhabited rocky
islet of <i>Il Toro</i>, off the S.W. coast of Sardinia, and the <i>Golfo di

<p class='c011'>The steamer skirts the Spanish coast from Gibraltar to <i>Iviza</i>

but when the mistral, or N. wind, blows a more westerly course
is chosen, past the volcanic <i>Columbretes</i> islets (lighthouse) and
along the coast of <i>Catalonia</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, to the S.E. of the <i>Rhone Delta</i>, and flanked with bare
limestone hills, we sight the <i>Bay of Marseilles</i>, bounded by the

<p class='c009'><i>Marseilles</i>, Fr. <i>Marseille</i>, the second-largest city in France,
with 517,500 inhab., the <i>Massalia</i> of the Greeks and <i>Massilia</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the Romans, was founded by Greeks from Phocæa (p. <a href='#Page_530'>530</a>) in
Asia Minor about 600 B. C., and soon became one of the greatest
seaports on the Mediterranean. During the Roman period it vied
with Athens as a seat of Greek culture; in the middle ages it
belonged to the kingdom of Arelate, and later to the county of
Provence, and in 1481 it was at length annexed to France. Being
situated at the mouth of the great and time-honoured route through
the Rhone Valley to N.W. Europe, it is the most important of
French and of all Mediterranean seaports. The total exports and
imports are estimated at 2926 million francs, and nearly 17 million
tons of shipping enter and clear annually. The city is now almost
entirely modern and destitute of historical memorials.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the <i>Bassin du Lazaret</i> (Pl. B, 1) and <i>Bassin de la Joliette</i>
(Pl. B, 2, 3), the southmost of the docks constructed since
1850 to the N.W. of the old town, we follow the Quai de la Joliette
to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. B, C, 3; <i>Ste. Marie Majeure</i> or <i>La Major</i>),
situated on a terrace. This is one of the largest and finest churches
of the 19th cent.; it was built by <i>Vaudoyer</i>, in a mixed Byzantine
and Romanesque style, in 1852–93. Adjacent is the <i>Old Cathedral
of St. Lazare</i>, which is shown by the sacristan of the new church.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Place de la Major the Esplanade de la Tourette leads
to the S. to the *<b>Vieux Port</b> (Pl. C, D, 4, 5), the <i>Lakydon</i> of the
Phocæans, a deeply indented creek, where smaller craft only are now
berthed. The entrance to it is guarded by the old forts of <i>Grasse-Tilly</i>
and <i>Entrecasteaux</i>. Just inside the entrance the harbour is
crossed by the <i>Pont Transbordeur</i> or <i>Transporter Bridge</i> (p. <a href='#Page_120'>120</a>);
for the sake of the view we may ascend either to the trolley-way
(buffet-restaurant) or to the top of the N. tower (steps up and down
50 c.; lift up 60, up and down 75 c.).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. side of the Quai du Port (Pl. C, D, 4), the scene of
motley popular traffic (pickpockets not uncommon), lies the <span class='sc'>Old
Town</span>, with its narrow and dirty streets, inhabited by the lower
classes, including numerous Italians of whom the city contains
about 100,000. This quay leads past the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> (Pl. C, 4),
an interesting building of the 17th cent., to the E. end of the Vieux
Port, where begins the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<span class='sc'>Rue Cannebière</span> (Pl. D, E, 4), which for ages has been the
chief boast of the city. Here, on the left, is the <i>Bourse</i> (Pl. E, 4),
erected by Coste in 1852–60.</p>

<p class='c011'>This street, prolonged by the Rue Noailles, the Allées de
Meilhan, etc., intersects the city from S.W. to N.E., and at the
<span class='sc'>Cours St. Louis</span> (Pl. E, 4), the chief centre of traffic, it is crossed
by a straight line of streets running from N.W. to S.E., the Cours
Belsunce, Rue de Rome, and Promenade du Prado, to the Rond
Point (p. <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>), being in all nearly 3 M. long.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>The Rue Noailles (Pl. E, 4), from the end of which the Boulevard
Dugommier ascends to the railway-station, and the pretty Allées
de Meilhan (Pl. F, 4) lead to the modern-Gothic church of <i>St.
Vincent de Paul</i> (Pl. F, 3), with its two towers commanding a
great part of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the left is the Cours du Chapitre, leading into the
Boulevard Longchamp (Pl. G, H, 3, 2), a street ascending steeply
to the *<b>Palais de Longchamp</b> (Pl. H, 2). This imposing
Renaissance edifice was designed by <i>Espérandieu</i>, the architect
(1862–9). The Ionic colonnade, with a lofty triumphal arch in the
centre, where a picturesque cascade has been introduced, is flanked
with two wings, the right containing the <i>Natural History Museum</i>,
and the left the <i>Museum of Fine Art</i> (adm. daily except Mon.
and Frid., 8–12 and 2–5 or in winter 9–12 and 2–4; closed 20th–31st
Jan. and 20th–31st July).</p>

<p class='c016'>The groundfloor contains sculptures. In the centre is the principal
hall. The room on the left contains works by the Marseillais master
<i>Pierre Puget</i> (1622–94); in that on the right is a model of the Monument
to the Dead in Père Lachaise at Paris, by <i>Bartholomé</i>. The staircase is
adorned with a wall-painting by <i>Puvis de Chavannes</i> (1869).</p>

<p class='c022'>On the first floor is the picture-gallery. Among the older pictures
in the central room are: 361. <i>Nattier</i>, Duchesse de Châteauroux; 788.
<i>Pietro Perugino</i>, Holy Family; 914. <i>Rubens</i>, Boar-hunt (about 1615). In
the modern department, in the room on the left: 430. <i>J. Fr. Millet</i>,
Mother and child (1860).</p>

<p class='c009'>The main streets of the S. quarter of the town are the Rue de
Rome, which begins at the Cours St. Louis (p. <a href='#Page_121'>121</a>), and a little to
the W. of it the handsome Cours Pierre-Puget (Pl. E, D, 5, 6),
ending in the Promenade of that name.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the S., on a bold rock of white limestone, is enthroned
the church of *<i>Notre Dame de la Garde</i> (Pl. D, 7; 532 ft.), a
great landmark for mariners, where we obtain the finest view of
the city and its environs. Lift (Ascenseur; Pl. D, 7) from the Rue
Cherchell (up 60, down 30, return 80 c.; on Sun. and before 9
a.m., 40, 20, or 50 c.).</p>

<p class='c011'>On a fine day the traveller will be repaid by a visit to the
*<b>Chemin de la Corniche</b> (comp. Pl. A, 6; tramway, p. <a href='#Page_120'>120</a>).
From Notre Dame de la Garde it may be reached direct in about
40 min. by the Chemin du Roucas-Blanc. This road, partly hewn
in the rock, and shadeless, affords fine views. It ends, near the
<i>Château Borély</i>, which stands in a park and now contains the
Musée d’Archéologie, at the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Promenade du Prado</span>, a favourite resort of the Marseillais,
planted with plane-trees. A gay throng may be seen here on Sunday
afternoons and every fine evening. We may return thence to
the town by the Rond Point du Prado.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>From Cartagena to Oran</span> (132 M.). <i>Comp. Générale Transatlantique</i>
every Tues. in 9 hrs. (fares, without food, 50 and 35 fr.; pier-dues at
Cartagena 3 or 2 fr.; agent J. M. Pelegrin, Plaza de la Aduana 1; at
Oran, p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>). This is the shortest sea-route to Algiers and is recommended
to those who are bad sailors. Passport necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Steering from <i>Tangier</i> (p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>) to the E.N.E. through the <i>Straits
of Gibraltar</i>, the vessel passes <i>Cape Malabata</i> (p. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>), <i>Cape
Alboasa</i>, and the fine shore of the <i>Cala Grande</i>, to which the <i>Rio
de las Ostras</i> descends from the <i>Sierra San Simonito</i>, a branch
of the <i>Anjera Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>). In the little bay on the E. side of
the <i>Punta Alcázar</i>, scarcely visible from the sea, lie the ruins of
<i>Ksar es-Serîr</i>, a small seaport founded by Yakûb ibn Yûsuf (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>),
which prospered in the later middle ages, and belonged to the
Portuguese from 1448 to 1540.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off <i>Cape Ciris</i> (p. <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>) the steamer nears the abrupt slopes of
the <i>Sierra Bullones</i> (p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>) and then passes the <i>Isla del Peregil</i>
(243 ft.), which is overgrown with underwood and contains a large
grotto (<i>Grotta de las Palomas</i>, visited from Ceuta). Beyond
<i>Cape Leona</i> and the <i>Bay of Benzus</i> the region of <i>Ceuta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>)
is reached. Fine view of the bay of Algeciras (p. <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>) and the rock
of Gibraltar to the N.</p>

<p class='c011'>After passing the bay of Ceuta and the N. and E. headlands of
the peninsula of <i>Almina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>), the <i>Punta Santa Catalina</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>) and the <i>Punta de la Almina</i> (lighthouse), we obtain an
admirable view of the Moroccan coast, extending from the Sierra
Bullones (p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>) to the finely shaped <i>Jebel Beni Hassan</i>. In
the centre, between <i>Cabo Negro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>) and <i>Cabo Mazari</i>, is
the deep depression of the plain of <i>Tetuán</i> (p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>), where the
steamers of the Navigation Mixte call on their voyage to Tangier
only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The vessel now steers to the E.S.E. towards Cape Tres Forcas,
quite apart from the <i>Rîf Coast</i>, a hill-region inhabited by the <i>Ruâfa</i>
(sing. <i>Rîfi</i>) and still forming part of the Blad es-Siba (p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>). It
lies between the <i>Wâd Waringa</i>, the river bounding the province
of Tetuán, and Cape Tres Forcas. In the bay of Alhucemas rise
the rocky islets of <i>Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera</i> and <i>Islas de
Alhucema</i>, with two Spanish ‘presidios’. The <i>Betoya</i>, the stretch
of coast with its numerous creeks between <i>Cape Quilates</i>, on the
E. side of the Alhucemas Bay, and Cape Tres Forcas, was for centuries
the favourite haunt of the Rîf pirates (p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Beyond the wedge-like <i>Cape Tres Forcas</i>, the ancient <i>Sestiaria
Promontorium</i> (Arabic <i>Râs Wark</i>), jutting out 12½ M. seaward,
we sight the long coast-line of the <i>Bay of Melilla</i>, into
which the steamers from Málaga, passing some 20 M. to the W.
of the island of <i>Alborán</i> (p. <a href='#Page_117'>117</a>), steer direct.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Melilla</b> (Hot. de Asia, Fonda la Africana, both at the harbour
and plain), or <i>Melila</i>, a town of 9000 inhab., the only Mediterranean
port on the Morocco coast besides Ceuta and Tetuán lies most picturesquely
on the spurs of <i>Monte Melila</i> or <i>Caramu</i> (3235 ft.), a
little to the N. of the marshy, fever-stricken mouth of the <i>Rio del
Oro</i>. Its site is probably that of the ancient <i>Rusaddir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>),
where ended the great Roman military road, about 1430 M. long,
which connected Carthage with Mauretania. Melilla is the oldest
Spanish possession in Morocco, having been captured in 1496. In
1774 it was unsuccessfully besieged by a Moroccan army, and in
1893 it resisted an attack by the Berbers of the Rîf. Being a free
port, it carries on a brisk trade with the coast-towns of the Algerian
province of Oran, and many Moroccans from the interior embark
here on their way to the harvesting in Algeria. The larger steamers
anchor in the roads, which are tolerably sheltered from the
W. winds only (landing or embarkation 50 c.). New harbour-works,
however, are now under construction. The drinking-water of Melilla
is not good.</p>

<p class='c011'>Melilla consists of the small and tidy new town which has been
built near the harbour since 1893 and contains a covered market,
the shops of the Spanish-Jewish and Moorish tradesmen, and the
promenade, and of the remarkably clean old town, enclosed by lofty
walls, and occupying the nearly square plateau of a rocky headland.
From projecting parts of the town-wall a fine view is obtained of the
<i>Fort Rosario</i>, which is separated from the old town by the small
<i>Galápago Bay</i>, and of the broad bay extending to the Chafarinas
Islands (see below); in the background, beyond the <i>Mar Chica</i> or
<i>Lago de Puerto Nuevo</i> (Arabic <i>Sebkha Bu-Erg</i>), a shallow lake
13 M. long, appears the lofty chain of <i>Jebel Kebdana</i> with the
<i>Monte de Tessan</i> (3275 ft.).</p>

<p class='c009'>Continuing our <span class='sc'>Voyage</span>, we pass the <i>Chafarinas Islands</i>
(French <i>Iles Zafarines</i>), occupied by the Spanish since 1848,
which lie off the <i>Cabo del Agua</i> and form the only safe harbour
on this coast as far as Oran. On the <i>Isla Isabel Segunda</i>, the
central island, rises a lighthouse visible at a distance of 20 M.</p>

<p class='c011'>We pass the mouth of the <i>Mulûya</i> (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>), the ancient <i>Malucha</i>
(or <i>Muluchath</i>), which separated the provinces of Mauretania
Tingitana and Mauretania Cæsariensis (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>), and was in the
middle ages the boundary between the kingdoms of Fez and
Tlemcen (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>). Beyond it, rising above the thickly peopled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>coast-plain of <i>Tazagraret</i>, rises the chain of <i>Jebel Beni Snassen</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>), which belongs geologically to the Algerian Tell Atlas
(p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>). The political frontier between Morocco and Algeria is
formed by the brook <i>Oued Kiss</i> or <i>Adjeroud</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), near
which, on the little <i>Baie d’Adjeroud</i>, and not far from <i>Cape
Milonia</i>, lies the French seaport of <i>Port-Say</i> or <i>Adjeroud</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In calm weather the steamers call at the bay of <b>Nemours</b>
(p. <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>), enclosed by the spurs of the <i>Traras Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>; landing
or embarkation 1 fr.). They then pass <i>Cape Torsa</i> and <i>Cape Noé</i>,
where the plateau of <i>Mont Tadjera</i> (2592 ft.) is sighted, and steer
to the N.E. towards Cape Figalo, at some distance from the little
port of <i>Honeïn</i> (here the iron-ore of <i>Rhar el-Maden</i> is exported),
the lighthouse on the island of <i>Rachgoun</i> (opposite the mouth of the
<i>Tafna</i>, p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>), and the port of <i>Beni-Saf</i> (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). To the N.E.,
beyond <i>Cape Figalo</i>, appear the <i>Isles Habibas</i> (lighthouse), surrounded
by reefs, and then, beyond <i>Cape Lindless</i>, the uninhabited
little <i>Ile Plane</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Cape Falcon</i> (lighthouse; p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) we survey the broad
<i>Gulf of Oran</i> (p. <a href='#Page_126'>126</a>), as far as the <i>Pointe de l’Aiguille</i>. Immediately
to the right, in the fertile <i>Plaine des Andalouses</i>, lies the
village of <i>Aïn et-Turk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>); then, beyond the spurs of the
<i>Jebel Santon</i>, the harbour of <i>Mers el-Kébir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>), with a fort
and lighthouse. Entrance to the harbour of <i>Oran</i>, comp. p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a>.</p>

(230 ft.), a ruined castle on a hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>The entrance to the inner harbour, which is closed by the

bay is protected on the S.E. by the little island of <i>Escombrera</i>,
the ancient <i>Scombraria</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Oran steamboats, soon after leaving Cartagena, steer due

<p class='c009'><i>Marseilles</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_119'>119</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Algiers</span> steamer usually passes close to the E. side of the
island of <i>Minorca</i>, the eastmost of the Balearic group, where, in
daylight, the deeply indented natural harbour of <i>Mahon</i>, the chief
town, specially attracts attention. When the sea is rough the
course is sometimes more westerly, past <i>Cape Minorca</i> (lighthouse),
the W. extremity of the island, while inland on the flat
coast lies the town of <i>Ciudadela</i>; the vessel then passes at some
distance from the <i>Cabo de Pera</i> (lighthouse), and from the hilly
S.E. coast of <i>Majorca</i>, which is famed for its stalactite caverns
(see Baedeker’s Spain and Portugal).</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, in clear weather, we obtain a glorious *View of the
Algerian coast, from the hills of <i>Cape Bengut</i> (lighthouse) to the E.,
and the <i>Jurjura Chain</i> and the <i>Tell Atlas</i> to the S.E., both snow-clad
in winter, to the wooded hill-country of <i>Sahel</i>, culminating in
<i>Mont Bouzaréah</i>, and <i>Cape Caxine</i> (lighthouse) to the W. We
now enter the fine *<i>Bay of Algiers</i> (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), bounded by <i>Cape
Matifou</i> (lighthouse) on the N.E. and the cliffs of the <i>Pointe Pescade</i>
on the N.W., and survey its whole expanse. To the left, in the
<i>Mitidja Plain</i>, between Cape Matifou and the sand-hills at the
mouth of the Harrach, lies <i>Fort-de-l’Eau</i>, a sea-bathing place;
beyond the Harrach, on the hill, stands the church of <i>Kouba</i>;
farther along the coast, among the houses of <i>Hussein-Dey</i> and <i>Belcourt</i>,
lies the <i>Jardin d’Essai</i>, backed by the gardens of <i>Mustapha-Supérieur</i>;
behind the harbour of Algiers rises the high terrace-wall
of the boulevards; then, above the new town, the white houses
and lanes of the Kasba on the spurs of the hill crowned with the
<i>Fort l’Empereur</i>; lastly, on the slope of the Bouzaréah hill, between
the N.W. suburbs <i>Bab el-Oued</i> and <i>St. Eugène</i>, appears
<i>Notre-Dame d’Afrique</i>, the mariners’ church.—Arrival in the
harbour, see p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>On the voyage from Marseilles to <span class='sc'>Bougie</span> the course is more
easterly, out of sight of the Balearic Islands. The tedium of the
voyage is at length compensated for near the Algerian coast by an
imposing *View of the mountains of <i>Kabylia</i>, which after a snowfall
in winter have quite an Alpine charm. To the W., between
<i>Cape Sigli</i> and <i>Cape Carbon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_264'>264</a>) lies the abrupt and almost
uninhabited coast of <i>Great Kabylia</i>, overtopped by the lofty
<i>Jebel Arbalou</i> (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>). To the S., behind the fine curved outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of the <i>Gulf of Bougie</i> (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>), and beyond the plain of the
<i>Soumane Valley</i>, rise the heights of <i>Little Kabylia</i>, with the
deep depression of the <i>Agrioun Valley</i>, and, to the S.E., the serrated
range of <i>Jebel Tababor</i> (6460 ft.). To the E., beyond <i>Cape
Cavallo</i>, stretches the hill-region of <i>Djidjelli</i>. In the N.E. angle
of the bay, on the S. slope of the <i>Jebel Gouraya</i>, but long concealed
by the three spurs of that mountain (Cape Carbon, p. <a href='#Page_264'>264</a>,
<i>Cape Noir</i>, and <i>Cape Bouak</i>, with its lighthouse), lies most
picturesquely the quiet seaport of <i>Bougie</i>, embosomed in luxuriant
evergreen vegetation (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The crossing to <span class='sc'>Philippeville</span> is specially recommended to travellers
bound for Biskra direct, as they thus avoid the long railway
journey from Algiers. The broad <i>Gulf of Stora</i>, with its
numerous headlands and creeks and its beautiful wooded hills,
presents a charming picture, especially in spring. In the background,
in a pleasant creek, lies <i>Philippeville</i> (p. <a href='#Page_304'>304</a>). In passing
through the outer harbour we obtain a good view of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the voyage to <span class='sc'>Bona</span> the first land sighted on the Algerian
coast is the lofty <i>Mount Edough</i> (3307 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), the spurs of
which extend to the N.W. to the <i>Cap de Fer</i> (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>). The steamers
then enter the <i>Gulf of Bona</i>, bounded on the W. by the <i>Cap de
Garde</i> (lighthouse), the N.E. spur of Mt. Edough, and on the E.
by <i>Cape Rosa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>). On the S. margin of the bay, above the
marshy alluvial plain of the <i>Seybouse</i> and the <i>Oued Mafrag</i>, rise
the peaks of the <i>Tell Atlas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the W. side of the gulf, between the spurs of the Edough,
lies <i>Bona</i> (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>), one of the most important and most beautiful
seaports of Barbary, with rich verdure all around. Before entering
the grand harbour, commanded by the hill of the Kasba, we
view the <i>Corniche Road</i> (p. <a href='#Page_311'>311</a>), while on the low hill of <i>Hippo</i>,
to the S. of the town, rises the church of <i>St. Augustine</i> (p. <a href='#Page_312'>312</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Marseilles</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_119'>119</a>.—After remaining for some time in
view of the coast of <i>Provence</i> as far as <i>Cape Sicié</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_132'>132</a>),
the vessel steers to the S.E. and loses sight of land.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Off the <i>Isola di Mal di Ventre</i> we may catch a glimpse of the
peninsula of <i>Sinis</i>, which lies on the N. side of the large <i>Gulf of
Oristano</i>, on the W. coast of <i>Sardinia</i>, and at whose S. end once
lay the Phœnician colony of <i>Tharros</i>. The bare and monotonous
hills of the S.W. coast, with the well-known lead and zinc mines
of the <i>Iglesiente</i>, the region round Iglesias, are only visible in
clear weather. The steamer rounds the islands of <i>San Pietro</i> and
<i>San Antioco</i> (p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>), with its capital of the same name on the E.
coast, occupying the site of the Phœnician <i>Sulci</i>. We pass the <i>Golfo
di Palmas</i>, with the uninhabited islets of <i>La Vacca</i>, <i>Il Vitello</i>,
and <i>Il Toro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>), and then <i>Cape Teulada</i> (p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>), after which
Sardinia is soon lost to view.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S.W. appears the distant <i>Ile de la Galite</i> (p. <a href='#Page_132'>132</a>); then,
on the coast of <i>Tunisia</i>, we descry the low spurs of the <i>Tell Atlas</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>), with the headlands of <i>Râs el-Koran</i>, <i>Râs Engelah</i> (lighthouse;
the northmost point of the African continent), <i>Cap Blanc</i>
(lighthouse; the <i>Promontorium Candidum</i> of antiquity), and <i>Cap
de Bizerte</i> or <i>Cap Guardia</i> (853 ft.; lighthouse). To the S.E.
another lighthouse marks the rocks of ‘<i>I Cani</i>‘.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some steamers call at <i>Bizerta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>); the others steer to the
left, past the Cani and the island of <i>Pilau</i> (p. <a href='#Page_132'>132</a>), towards the
little <i>Ile Plane</i> (lighthouse), which lies off <i>Cape Farina</i> (Arabic
<i>Râs Tarf</i>; the ancient <i>Promontorium Apollinis</i>), where we come
in sight of the broad <i>Gulf of Tunis</i>, with the island of <i>Zembra</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_153'>153</a>) in the background.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now cross the <i>Bay of Utica</i> (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>) to the S., which since
ancient times has been largely filled up with the deposits of the
<i>Medjerda</i> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>), pass <i>Cape Kamart</i> (p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>) and <i>La Marsa</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>), and then reach the picturesque <i>Cape Carthage</i> (p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>),
with its lighthouse and the sea-baths and white houses of <i>Sidi Bou-Saïd</i>.
We now enter the *<i>Inner Bay of Tunis</i>, commanded on the
E. by <i>Jebel Korbous</i> (p. <a href='#Page_364'>364</a>) and on the S. by <i>Jebel Bou-Kornin</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>), <i>Jebel Ressas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>), and <i>Jebel Zaghouan</i> (p. <a href='#Page_359'>359</a>); we
pass close to the castle-hill of <i>Carthage</i> (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), crowned with the
cathedral, the sea-baths of <i>Le Kram</i>, <i>Khéreddine</i>, and <i>Goulette
Neuve</i> (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), and reach <i>Goletta</i> (or <i>La Goulette</i>; p. <a href='#Page_343'>343</a>), a
small seaport, situated on the tongue of land separating the <i>Lac
de Tunis</i> or <i>Lac Bahira</i> (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>) from the open sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer here enters the canal, 5½ M. long, 110 yds. wide,
and about 20 ft. deep, constructed across the lake in 1893, where
we have a good view of the white houses of Tunis. On the right
lies the island of <i>Chikly</i>, with relics of a castle built by Emp.
Charles V. The surface of the lake is sometimes enlivened by
flamingoes. The steamer, at half-speed, takes another hour to reach
<i>Tunis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_329'>329</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Or the voyage may be pleasantly divided as follows: Marseilles steamer
of <i>Comp. Gén. Transatlantique</i> from Algiers to Bougie (Frid. evening; in

from Bougie to Philippeville (Tues. afternoon; in 12 hrs.; 18 or 12 fr.); Marseilles
steamer of <i>Navigation Mixte</i> from Philippeville to Bona (Sat. forenoon;
in 5 hrs.; 10 or 8 fr.); from Bona to Bizerta, by cargo-boat as above,
or by railway; from Bizerta to Tunis by Marseilles steamer of the <i>Comp.
Gén. Transatlantique</i> (p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>; Sat. night; in 5 hrs.; 15 or 12 fr.).—The
small coasting steamers of <i>Prosper Durand</i> of Marseilles and of the
<i>Lignes Cotières Algériennes</i>, which call at most of the ports as far as
Bona, can only be recommended for short voyages by daylight.</p>

<p class='c022'>The coast scenery between Algiers and Tunis is exceedingly picturesque
and varied, but the voyage is often very trying for bad sailors.
Storms are most frequent between Djidjelli and Collo, and between La
Calle and Bizerta, and fogs are not uncommon, even in summer.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Algiers</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>. As the steamer leaves the harbour a beautiful
*View is obtained astern of the town and of the coast as far as
the <i>Pointe Pescade</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_127'>127</a>). Beyond <i>Cape Matifou</i> the
coast, overlooked by the serrated <i>Jebel Bou-Zegza</i> (p. <a href='#Page_249'>249</a>), recedes
for a time from view.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near <i>Jebel Djinet</i> (p. <a href='#Page_253'>253</a>), beyond the sand-hills at the mouth
of the <i>Isser</i> (p. <a href='#Page_253'>253</a>), begins the bold rock-bound coast of <i>Great
Kabylia</i>, 87 M. in length, with its headlands and cliffs worn by
the surf, its secluded little seaports, and its hill-sides carefully cultivated
by the natives.</p>

<p class='c011'>We pass the mouth of the <i>Sebaou</i> (p. <a href='#Page_253'>253</a>), the largest stream
in Kabylia, and <i>Cape Bengut</i> (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>), which affords scanty protection
against the W. winds to the port of <i>Dellys</i> (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>); then
<i>Tigzirt</i> (p. <a href='#Page_255'>255</a>), <i>Cape Tedless</i>, and <i>Port Gueydon</i> or <i>Azeffoun</i>
(lighthouse), with its roadstead open towards the W. Next comes
the wildest and loneliest part of the coast, between <i>Cape Corbelin</i>
and Cape Carbon; we pass <i>Cape Sigli</i>, the <i>Pointe Timri n’Tguerfa</i>,
where <i>Jebel Arbalou</i> (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>) comes in sight, and <i>Cape Boulima</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the little <i>Ile Pisan</i> or <i>Djeribia</i>, overlooked by the steep
slopes of <i>Jebel Gouraya</i> (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>), the steamer rounds <i>Cape Carbon</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_264'>264</a>), passes <i>Cape Noir</i> and <i>Cape Bouak</i>, and enters the harbour
of <b>Bougie</b> (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Gulf of Bougie</i>, in winter the finest part of this coast,
presents many superb scenes (comp. 128), notably as we look back
at the town of Bougie climbing the slope of Jebel Gouraya.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near <i>Cape Cavallo</i>, in the E. part of <i>Little Kabylia</i>, the summits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of <i>Jebel Hadid</i> (4780 ft.) and <i>Msid Echta</i> (5072 ft.) are
specially prominent. We next pass the curiously shaped hill in the
<i>Ile du Grand-Cavallo</i>, the <i>Petit-Cavallo</i>, and the headland <i>Râs
Afia</i> (lighthouse), and reach the little seaport of—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Djidjelli</b> (p. <a href='#Page_267'>267</a>), pleasantly situated at the foot of green hills,
where the steamers anchor in the open roads (landing or embarkation
½ fr.). If time permit, the <i>Vigie</i> should be visited.</p>

<p class='c011'>The vessel now steers to the N.E. at some distance from the
coast; we pass the mouths of the <i>Oued Nil</i> and the <i>Oued el-Kébir</i>,
the ancient boundary between Mauretania and Numidia, and then
the <i>Râs Atia</i> (lighthouse): Fine view of the <i>Bougaroun Mts.</i>, commonly
called <i>Sahel de Collo</i>, famed for their forest of cork-trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near <i>Cape Bougaroun</i> or <i>Bougaroni</i> (lighthouse), the northmost
point of Algeria, opens the broad <i>Gulf of Stora</i> (p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>),
bounded on the E. by the Cap de Fer (see below). On the W. bank
of the gulf, in the little <i>Bay of Collo</i>, and between the peninsula
of <i>Djerda</i> (lighthouse) and the <i>Râs Frao</i>, lies the small seaport
of—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Collo</b> (Grand-Hôtel, poor), important only for the export of
cork, the ancient <i>Chullu</i> or <i>Colonia Minervia Chullu</i>, one of the
four Coloniæ Cirtenses (p. <a href='#Page_298'>298</a>), in a fertile hill-region. From
the harbour (landing or embarkation 30 c.) we walk round the
*Peninsula, planted with vines and cacti, and overgrown on the
N. side with underwood, and affording splendid views of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steering to the E. we now skirt the coast, where the <i>Cape El-Kalaa</i>
or <i>Râs Bibi</i> (535 ft.), rising abruptly on both sides, specially
strikes the eye, and pass the <i>Pointe Esrah</i> and the bay of that
name. By the islet of <i>Sgrigina</i> (lighthouse), which lies in front of
the <i>Pointe Akmês</i> or <i>Sgrigina</i>, opens the <i>Inner Bay of Stora</i>,
bounded by <i>Jebel Filfila</i>, a mountain rich in marble, while in the
background lies the harbour of <b>Philippeville</b> (p. <a href='#Page_304'>304</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N.E. margin of the gulf, beyond the plain of the <i>Oued
el-Kébir</i>, with its border of sand-hills, rise the spurs of <i>Mont
Edough</i> (p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>). The steamer next rounds the almost insular <i>Cap
de Fer</i> (1148 ft.; lighthouse), where we again view the whole expanse
of the gulf, and passes <i>Cape Toukouch</i>, which shelters the
bay of <i>Herbillon</i> (lighthouse) from the W. and N.W. winds. We
now steer to the E.S.E., past the bare <i>Jebel Gouari</i> (1880 ft.),
<i>Cape Axin</i>, and the dark rock of the <i>Voile Noire</i> (213 ft.), towards
the <i>Cap de Garde</i> (p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>), which projects in front of the gulf of
<b>Bona</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three hours’ steaming from Bona, past the low <i>Cape Rosa</i>,
whose light is seen 30 M. away, brings us to the open roads of
<b>La Calle</b> (hotel), where landing is impossible in rough weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the rock of <i>Kef Mechtob</i> (591 ft.), and a little short of
<i>Cape Roux</i>, which is crowned with a ruined tower, and like Cape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Rosa was once famed for its coral-reefs, runs the frontier of <i>Tunisia</i>.
The wooded hills rising abruptly from the sea belong to the
region of the <i>Kroumirie</i> (p. <a href='#Page_326'>326</a>), so often mentioned in the recent
history of the country.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Tabarca</b> (p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>), the next port, lies picturesquely in a bay
behind the island of <i>Tabarca</i> with its ruined Genoese castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again steering to the N.E. we pass a range of high sand-hills
and the mouth of the <i>Oued Zouara</i>, where we have a glimpse of
the <i>Nefza Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Off <i>Cape Negro</i> appears in clear weather the coral-girt <i>Ile de
la Galite</i> (1290 ft.), the <i>Calatha</i> of antiquity, about 24 M. to the
N.W. of <i>Cape Serrat</i> (lighthouse), where the ramifications of the
<i>Mogod Mts.</i> approach the coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the cliffs of the two <i>Fratelli</i> and the <i>Râs al-Dukara</i>
we round the <i>Bizerta Hills</i>, the northmost part of the African
coast, with the four headlands <i>Râs el-Koran</i>, <i>Râs Engelah</i>, <i>Cape
Blanc</i>, and <i>Cape de Bizerte</i> (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>). As we near the bay of
<b>Bizerta</b> (p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>), fringed with low olive-clad hills, we descry, far
to the S.W., the <i>Jebel Ichkeul</i> (p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Steaming farther to the E., we observe the <i>Cani</i> (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>) on the
left, and pass <i>Râs Zebib</i>, where the green island of <i>Pilau</i> (377 ft.)
becomes visible in the foreground. To the right, on the N. slope
of <i>Jebel Nadour</i> (p. <a href='#Page_354'>354</a>), covered far up with sea-sand, lies the
highly picturesque Arab village of <i>Metlineh</i>.</p>

<i>Bay of Ajaccio</i>, where at night the lights on the <i>Iles Sanguinaires</i>
may be descried. We next pass the <i>Gulf of Valinco</i>, and at <i>Cape
Aquila</i> or <i>Senetosa</i> (lighthouse) we approach the S.W. coast of
Corsica, fringed with numerous bays and creeks. Off the rocks
called <i>Les Moines</i> (<i>Monaci</i>) we sight, to the left, the <i>Montagne
de Cagna</i> (4518 ft.), which is usually covered with snow in winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passage of the *<i>Straits of Bonifacio</i>, between Corsica and
<i>Sardinia</i>, is very beautiful when the light is favourable. At the
narrowest part, between <i>Cape Pertusato</i> and <i>Punta del Falcone</i>,
they are 7 M. wide. Between the lighthouses of <i>Capo di Feno</i>
and Capo Pertusato, amid fissured limestone rocks honeycombed
with caverns, rises a headland crowned with the grey old Genoese
citadel and the white houses of <i>Bonifacio</i>. Opposite to it, on the
N. coast of Sardinia, is the peninsula of <i>Capo Testa</i>, and near the
Punta del Falcone lies the narrow <i>Bay of Longo Sardo</i>, with the
little port of <i>Santa Teresa di Gallura</i>. Beyond the town rise the
hills of the <i>Gallura</i> in terraces, stretching far away to the <i>Monti
di Limbara</i> (4469 ft.). On the S.E. the horizon is bounded by a
girdle of granitic islands and rocks, the <i>Insulae Cuniculariae</i>
(‘rabbit-islands’) of Pliny, which imperil navigation, especially as
they are washed with a strong current from the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamers pass through the <i>Bocca Grande</i>, between the
lighthouses on the French island of <i>Lavezzi</i> and the Italian <i>Isola
dei Razzoli</i>. To the right, beyond the islets of <i>Santa Maria</i> and
<i>Isola dei Budelli</i>, appears the island of <i>Maddalena</i>, on which
rise a signalling station and the fort of <i>Guardia Vecchia</i> (545 ft.).
This island, the largest of the group, is connected with its neighbours
<i>Santo Stefano</i> and <i>Caprera</i> (696 ft.; once the residence of
Garibaldi; d. 1882) by roads built on embankments, and has been
converted into one of the strongest fortresses on the Mediterranean
in emulation of Porto Vecchio in Corsica and of Bizerta. Beyond
Caprera, and adjoining the deeply indented <i>Bay of Arsachena</i>,
appears the reddish <i>Capo di Ferro</i>, the N.W. point of Sardinia.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now steer across the <i>Tyrrhenian Sea</i> to the E.S.E. towards
the <i>Ponza Islands</i> (p. xxxi). We first pass the volcanic N.W. group,
<i>Palmarola</i> (the ancient <i>Palmaria</i>), <i>Ponza</i> (929 ft.; <i>Pontiae</i>, once
a Roman colony), with the lighthouse of <i>Punta della Guardia</i>, and
<i>Zannone</i> (<i>Sinonia</i>). Beyond <i>La Botte</i>, a rock dreaded by sailors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>begins the S.E. group, first <i>Ventotene</i>, the well-known <i>Pandateria</i>
of the Romans, to which Julia, Agrippina, and Octavia were banished,
and then the islet of <i>Santo Stefano</i> (lighthouse).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the distance appear the <i>Monte Epomeo</i> and the lighthouse
on the <i>Punta Imperatore</i> in the island of <i>Ischia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>). Approach
to the <i>Bay of Naples</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_135'>135</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Genoa</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>. In departing we survey in clear weather
the whole of the *<i>Gulf of Genoa</i>. On the left lies the <i>Riviera di
Levante</i>, as far as the <i>Monte di Portofino</i> (2000 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_117'>117</a>); on
the right are the <i>Ligurian Alps</i>, snow-capped in winter, and the
<i>Riviera di Ponente</i> as far as <i>Cape Mele</i> (p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The vessel steers for the island of Gorgona (see below), passing
Monte di Portofino at a distance of 6 or 7 M., and then gradually
leaves the coast; the last place visible is <i>Chiavari</i> on the beautiful
<i>Bay of Rapallo</i>. Beyond the headland of <i>Punta del Mesco</i>, where
the slopes of the <i>Cinque Terre</i>, a famous wine-country, descend
abruptly to the sea, appear the rocky islet of <i>Tino</i> (302 ft.; lighthouse)
and the fortified island of <i>Palmária</i> (614 ft.), at the S. point
of the <i>Gulf of Spezia</i>. The distant pinnacles of the <i>Apuan Alps</i>
are seen in clear weather. Of <i>Leghorn</i> (p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>), where some of the
Italian steamers call, the lights only are visible at night.</p>

<p class='c011'>The islands of <i>Gorgona</i> and <i>Capraia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>) lie on the right;
behind the latter sometimes peep the mountains of <i>Corsica</i> (p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>).
From the Ligurian we now pass into the <i>Tyrrhenian Sea</i>, either
through the <i>Strait of Piombino</i>, between the port of <i>Piombino</i> and
the rocky islet of <i>Palmaiola</i>, or through the <i>Palmaiola Strait</i>,
between that islet (lighthouse) and <i>Elba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>). By <i>Follónica</i>,
near Piombino, some furnaces, where iron from Elba is smelted,
gleam through the night. Beyond the <i>Bay of Portoferraio</i> and
<i>Capo della Vita</i>, the N.E. point of Elba, are seen near <i>Rio Marina</i>
the reddish-black hills where the iron-ore comes to the surface.
Farther to the S. is seen the depression of the bay of <i>Porto Longone</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>The <i>Promontory of Castiglione</i>, in the midst of the marshy
<i>Maremma Toscana</i>, and the small group of the islands of <i>Formíche
di Grosseto</i> remain some way to the left. The steamer then
passes through a strait between the steep headland of <i>Monte Argentario</i>
(2083 ft.) and the island of <i>Giglio</i> (1634 ft.), each with its
lighthouse. On the right lies the islet of <i>Giannutri</i> (305 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Steering towards the seaport of <i>Civitavecchia</i> and <i>Cape Linaro</i>,
we see the distant <i>Maremma di Roma</i>, backed by the volcanic
<i>Tolfa Mts.</i> (2011 ft.). Above the <i>Roman Campagna</i> rise the
<i>Sabine</i> and <i>Alban Mts.</i>, followed by the <i>Volscian Mts.</i> (Monti
Lepini) and the <i>Monte Circeo</i> (1775 ft.) in the <i>Pontine Marshes</i>.
Farther on, we obtain a glimpse of <i>Terracina</i>, the distant hills
on the <i>Gulf of Gaëta</i>, and, to the S.W., the <i>Ponza Islands</i> (p. <a href='#Page_133'>133</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the foreground we next sight <i>Vesuvius</i> and the island of
<i>Ischia</i> with <i>Monte Epomeo</i> (2589 ft.), by which <i>Capri</i> is at first
concealed. The steamers usually pass between Ischia and <i>Procida</i>,
but sometimes through the <i>Strait of Procida</i>, between that island
and <i>Cape Miseno</i>. The *<i>Bay of Naples</i>, which we now survey in
its full expanse, from the <i>Bay of Pozzuoli</i> and the hill of <i>Posilipo</i>
to the <i>Peninsula of Sorrento</i> (p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>), is strikingly picturesque.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Naples.</b>—<span class='sc'>Arrival by Sea.</span> The Mediterranean and New York
steamers of the North German Lloyd and those of the Società Nazionale are
berthed at the Immacolatella Nuova (Pl. G, H, 5). Passengers by other
steamers are landed at that quay by boat, those from the Lloyd and Orient
Royal Lines free of charge by steam-tender or boat respectively, from
others by rowing-boat (1 fr., with luggage, but bargain advisable). Travellers
should be on their guard against boatmen wearing the jerseys of well-known
steamboat-lines though not employed by these companies. Porter
(facchino) for small valise 40, trunk 80 c.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <b>Railway Station</b> (<i>Stazione Centrale</i>, Pl. H, 3) lies at the E.
end of the city, 12 min. from the Immacolatella Nuova (see above), and
½¾ M. from most of the hotels. Here arrive all the express trains from
the north, such as those from Verona (18½–20¼ hrs.), from Milan (17 hrs.),
from Turin (17½–22½ hrs.), and from Venice (20 hrs.). As the delivery
of luggage is a slow process, the traveller who is willing to pay somewhat
more may drive straight to his hotel without it, and have it sent
later. Porter (<i>facchino</i>) for each small package 15, for each trunk 25 c.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Naples</i>, Ital. <i>Napoli</i>, once the capital of the kingdom of
Naples, and now that of a province, is the most important seaport
and after Milan the most populous city of Italy (492,000 inhab.).
It lies in 40°51′ N. lat. and 14°15′ E. long., on the N. side of the
bay named after it, at the foot and on the slopes of several hills.
Its site and environs are among the most beautiful in the world.
The vicissitudes of its history are as remarkable as those of its
volcanic soil. Here in hoar antiquity Greeks from <i>Kyme</i> (Cumæ)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>founded <i>Parthenope</i>, afterwards called <i>Palaeopolis</i> or ‘old town’,
and <i>Neapolis</i>, or ‘new town’. Here, too, Ostrogoths, Byzantines,
Normans, and Hohenstaufen held sway. Charles of Anjou (1266–85)
made Naples his capital, which was much extended by Ferdinand I.
of Aragon (1458–94), by the Spanish viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo
(1532–53), and by the Bourbon Charles III. (1748–59). At length
in 1860 the kingdom and city were united to the kingdom of Italy.
In historic and artistic monuments Naples is far poorer than the
towns of Northern and Central Italy; but the matchless treasures
from Pompeii and Herculaneum preserved in the Museum, which
present a new and fascinating picture of ancient life, afford ample
compensation.</p>

<p class='c011'>A line drawn from the <i>Castel Sant’Elmo</i> (Pl. D, 5; p. <a href='#Page_141'>141</a>) to
the <i>Pizzofalcone</i> (Pl. E, 7), a height which terminates in the narrow
rock of the <i>Castello dell’Ovo</i>, divides the city into two parts.
To the E. lie the oldest and busiest quarters, of which the long <i>Via
Roma</i> (p. <a href='#Page_139'>139</a>) is the main street. The smaller part of the town, the
strangers’ quarter, extends along the shore to the W. from the Pizzofalcone
and up the slopes of Sant’Elmo and <i>Posilipo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_142'>142</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Harbour Quarter</span>, and particularly the lanes between the
Strada Nuova (Pl. G, H, 5) and the broad Corso Umberto Primo (Pl.
F-H, 5, 4), which leads to the station, still present diverse scenes
of popular life. Through this quarter the Strada del Duomo (p. <a href='#Page_140'>140</a>)
leads to the Strada Foria and the <i>Museum</i> (p. <a href='#Page_139'>139</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the <i>Immacolatella Vecchia</i> (Pl. G, 5), we follow the
Strada del Piliero (Pl. G, F, 5, 6; tramways Nos. 4 and 11; see
p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>) to the <i>Molo Angioino</i> (Pl. F, G, 6), the old quay which
separates the <i>Porto Mercantile</i> from the <i>Porto Militare</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjacent, on the W., lies the <span class='sc'>Piazza del Municipio</span> (Pl. F, 6),
with the <i>Municipio</i> or town-hall at its W. end. On the S.E. side
of this piazza is the approach to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Castel Nuovo</b> (Pl. F, 6), built for Charles I. of Anjou in
1279–83, and afterwards much enlarged. It was the residence successively
of the kings of the houses of Anjou and Aragon and the
Spanish viceroys, but is now used as barracks. The inner gateway
of the castle (adm. free) consists of a *<i>Triumphal Arch</i>, flanked
with two towers, in the early Renaissance style, erected in 1451–70
in memory of the entry of Alphonso I. of Aragon (1442).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza del Municipio the Strada San Carlo leads to
the S.W. to the <b>Galleria Umberto Primo</b> (Pl. E, F, 6), built in
1887–90, and vying with the grand arcade at Milan, and to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Piazza San Ferdinando</span> (Pl. E, 6), the business centre of the
city. (Tramcars and omnibuses, see p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>.) On the E. side rises the
<i>Teatro San Carlo</i> (Pl. F, 6), dating from 1737, one of the largest
in Europe. Adjacent, in the large Piazza del Plebiscito, rises the
<b>Palazzo Reale</b> (Pl. F, 6), begun in 1600.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>At the Piazza San Ferdinando begins the <span class='sc'>Via Roma</span>, the chief
artery of traffic, named the <i>Toledo</i> down to 1870, after its founder
Don Pedro de Toledo (1540). With its continuation the Salita del
Museo Nazionale it ascends for over a mile, between the lanes on
the slope of the Sant’Elmo hill, on the left, and the chief business
part of the city, on the right, to the National Museum. This long
line of streets, poor architecturally, is broken only by the small
Largo della Carità (Pl. E, 5) and the Piazza Dante (Pl. E, F, 4).
About halfway between these the Via Domenico Capitelli diverges
to the right to the church of—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Santa Chiara</i> (Pl. F, 4), the Pantheon of Naples, built in
1310–40, but tastelessly restored in 1742–57. The interior, planned
in the French Gothic style, resembles a great public hall. Behind
the high-altar is the Gothic *Monument of Robert the Wise (d. 1343),
the founder of the church. The transepts contain the monuments
of other Angevin kings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Museo Nazionale</b> (Pl. E, F, 3), built in 1586 as
cavalry barracks, was the seat of the University from 1616 to 1780,
but since 1790 has been occupied by the royal art-collections,
which are among the finest in the world. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the <span class='sc'>Ground Floor</span>, in the E. wing on the right of the vestibule,
are the *Greek Sculptures in marble. Entering by the first door, we begin
our visit with the colonnade of the archaic sculptures (Marmi Arcáici).
In the centre: 6009, 6010. Harmodios and Aristogeiton (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>).—Turning
to the right, we enter the rooms on the S. side of the building, which
contain sculptures of the First Golden Age of Greek art (5th cent.). In the
central room, 6322. Bust of Athena, probably after <i>Cephisodotus</i> (father
of Praxiteles); by the window, two statues of Aphrodite (after <i>Alcamenes</i>?);
I. Room on the right, 6005. So-called Hera Farnese; II. Room
on the left, *6727. The famous Orpheus relief; *6024. Statue of Athena
(after <i>Phidias</i>?). Also, in II. R. on the right, fine Mosaics.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the colonnade of the archaic sculptures we pass through R. II
into the Flora colonnade, the rooms on the right of which contain the
sculptures of the Second Golden Age of Greek art (4th cent.) and of the
later Greek or Hellenistic period. In the central room, 6306. Bearded
Dionysus, after <i>Praxiteles</i>. I. Side-Room on the right, *6035. Torso of
Aphrodite; without a number, Torso of a man sitting, a replica of the
so-called Ares Ludovisi, after <i>Lysippus</i>. II. Side-Room, Farnese Hercules,
after <i>Lysippus</i>, but coarsened. III. Side-Room on the left, Farnese Bull,
a colossal group, after <i>Apollonius</i> and <i>Tauriscus</i> of Rhodes.</p>

<p class='c022'>The third colonnade contains coloured sculptures. In the side-rooms
are fragments of sculptures and buildings. Crossing the vestibule to the
W. wing, we enter the—</p>

<p class='c022'>Colonnade of the Greek portrait-statues (Portico Iconográfico). On the
right, *6018. Æschines, the Athenian orator; 6023. Homer; 6135. Euripides.—Straight
on, we next come to the Portico degli Imperatori, containing
Greek and Roman portraits. In the centre, *Hermes of a Greek philosopher.
In the side-rooms, Roman sculptures and architectural fragments.
The central of these rooms contains the celebrated *Mosaic of the Battle
of Alexander.</p>

<p class='c022'>The remaining rooms contain the *Collection of the larger antique
bronzes. The chief rooms (I, II Bronzes from Pompeii, III-V from Herculaneum)
are on the S. front of the Museum. Room I. 5003. Young
Dionysos (so-called Narcissus). Room II. 5630. Archaic statue of Apollo
playing on the lyre; 4997. Victory. Room III. 5625. Hermes reposing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span><i>School of Lysippus</i>; 5633. Boy’s head (end of 5th cent.); *4885. Bust of
the Doryphorus (spear-bearer), after <i>Polycletus</i>; *5618. Head of bearded
Dionysus, after a work of the <i>School of Myron</i> (5th cent.). Room V.
5616. Hellenistic poet (the so-called Seneca).</p>

<p class='c022'>In the <span class='sc'>Mezzanino</span> (entresol), on the right, is the *Collection of ancient
wall-paintings (Affreschi Pompeiani) from Pompeii, Herculaneum, etc.—Room
I. 9105. Briseis carried off from the tent of Achilles; 9559. Nuptials
of Zeus and Hera. Room II. 8976. Medea about to slay her children;
9286. Dionysus and the sleeping Ariadne. Passage to R. V, 9180. ‘Cupids
for sale’. Room V. 8834. Girl gathering flowers; 9295. Bacchantes and
Satyrs; 9133. Centaurs; 9118–21. Rope-dancing satyrs.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>First Floor</span> (Primo Piano) contains, in the E. wing, to the left
of the staircase, the two Sale dei Commestibili, devoted to provisions,
textiles, pigments, etc. from Pompeii; also seven rooms on the N. side of
the building, occupied by the *Collection of the smaller bronzes (Piccoli
Bronzi), and by interesting domestic furniture from Pompeii, affording an
admirable idea of the ancient style of living.</p>

<p class='c022'>The whole of the W. wing is occupied by the Pinacotéca or picture-gallery,
chiefly of Italian works. Room I. <i>Correggio</i>, Betrothal of St.
Catharine. Room II. *<i>Titian</i>, Danae (1545), Pope Paul III. Farnese (1543
and 1545), and Philip II. of Spain. Room III. <i>Sebast. del Piombo</i>, Holy
Family, Popes Hadrian VI. and Clement VII. Room IV. <i>Raphael</i>, Holy
Family (Madonna del divino Amore). Room V. <i>Sandro Botticelli</i>, Madonna.</p>

<p class='c022'>The other rooms contain Renaissance objects (Oggetti del Cinquecento),
the Engravings, and the National Library.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Second Floor</span> (Secondo Piano) is dedicated to antique glass,
gold and silver plate, cut gems, etc., a most interesting and extensive
collection, one of the finest of its kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>N.E. Quarter</span>, between the Museum and the Central Station
(tramways Nos. 4 and 11; p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), also boasts of its sights.</p>

<p class='c011'>We follow the long Piazza Cavour (Pl. F, 3) to the N.E. from
the Museum, and at the beginning of the Via Foria descend the
Strada del Duomo to the right to the (4 min.)—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. G, 3; <i>San Gennaro</i>; best seen about noon), a
Gothic edifice, built in 1272–1323, but repeatedly modernized.
The third chapel in the right aisle is the famous Cappella di San
Gennaro or Cappella del Tesoro, added to the church in 1608–37;
the altar contains two phials of the blood of St. Januarius, which is
miraculously liquefied thrice yearly. The crypt, below the high-altar,
shows the finest example of Renaissance decoration in Naples
(1497–1507). From the left aisle is entered the basilica of <i>Santa
Restituta</i>, the old cathedral, founded in the 7th century.</p>

<p class='c011'>The church of <i>San Giovanni a Carbonara</i> (Pl. G, 3), in the
street of that name, a little way to the N.E. of the cathedral, contains,
at the back of the high-altar (1746), the late-Gothic *Monument
of king Ladislaus (d. 1414), by Andreas de Florentia.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the street, opposite the <i>Castel Capuano</i> (Pl. G, 3;
now law-courts), built by Emp. Frederick II. in 1231, rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Porta Capuana</b> (Pl. G, H, 3), one of the finest of Renaissance
gateways, built by the Florentine Giuliano da Maiano (1485),
with sculptures by Giovanni da Nola (1535).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The chief approach from the Piazza San Ferdinando (p. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>) to
the W. quarters is by the animated <span class='sc'>Strada di Chiaia</span> (Pl. E, 6).
From its W. end we proceed along the Strada Santa Caterina, bearing
to the left, cross the Piazza dei Martiri, and follow the Via
Calabritto, with its numerous shops, to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Largo della Vittoria</span> (Pl. D, 7; tramways, Nos. 1 and 4, and
omnibus, see p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>). This piazza may be reached also from the
Rione Santa Lucia on the E. side by the Via Parténope (Pl. F, E, 7),
which leads along the coast, past the <i>Costello dell’Ovo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>), and
affords fine views. On the W. side of the Largo lies the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Villa Nazionale</b> (Pl. C, D, 7), usually called <i>La Villa</i>, a
beautiful public garden planted with palms, bounded on the seaside
by the Via Caracciolo, the fashionable promenade of Naples, and
on the side next the town by the Riviera di Chiaia. A band plays
here on Sun., Tues., and Thurs., 2–4 o’clock (June-Oct. 9–11 p.m.).
In the middle of these grounds is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Zoological Station</i>, founded in 1872 by the German naturalist
A. Dohrn (d. 1909). The central building contains the *<b>Aquarium</b>
(Pl. D, 7; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), which presents an unrivalled and most
interesting picture of submarine life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The winding <b>Corso Vittorio Emanuele</b>, over 2½ M. long,
ascends from the coast a little way beyond the Villa Nazionale, or
it may be reached from the Museum by the Via Salvator Rosa
(Pl. E, 3; tramway No. 6, see p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>). Above the ‘Villa’, on the S.
slope of the Sant’ Elmo Hill, are situated the best hotels.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the hills to which the two funiculars and tramway No. 7
(p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>) ascend from the lower town lies the new quarter of <i>Rione
Vómero</i> (Pl. C, D, 5). On its E. side rises the old <i>Castel Sant’ Elmo</i>
(Pl. D, 5; 817 ft.), fortified with huge walls and with passages
hewn in the tufa rock, and now used as a military prison. From the
outer gate of the castle, at the tramway-terminus, we descend to
the E. to the suppressed Carthusian monastery of—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>San Martino</b> (Pl. D, 5; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), a Gothic building
of the 14th cent., tastefully restored in the baroque style about
1650. The church, the old farmacía (Room III), and the cloisters
are interesting. The other rooms contain Neapolitan memorials
and art-industry collections. Rooms XV and XVI (once the library)
are filled with Neapolitan majolicas and porcelain. From Room
XXX, to the right, we enter a *<i>Belvedere</i> (XXXII), whose balconies
offer a superb view of the city, Vesuvius, the bay, and the fertile
plain extending to the Apennines (best by afternoon light).</p>

<p class='c016'>A famous view (clear weather necessary) is obtained from the old
monastery of **<b>Camaldoli</b> (1503 ft.), founded in 1585 on the highest of the
hills to the N.W. of Sant’ Elmo. The rough road to it (carr. about 6, with
two horses 9–10 fr.; there and back 4½ hrs.) leaves the city near the <i>Porta
San Martino</i> (Pl. A, B, 2), the N.W. gate of the Cinta Daziaria or wall
of the <i>octroi</i> (town-customs). If on foot or on donkey back (2–2½ fr. and
fee to attendant; 5–6 hrs.), we go from <i>Rione Vomero</i> (see above) through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the suburb of <i>Antignano</i> (Pl. B, C, 4, 5) to the little customs-office of
<i>l’Archetiello</i> (Pl. B, 4), near which the bridle-path begins.</p>

<p class='c022'>The monastery (suppressed, and now private property, but still occupied
by several monks; fee 30–50 c.; ladies not admitted) offers little
attraction. Straight through the garden we reach a point of view which
commands the bays of Naples and Pozzuoli, the Phlegræan plain with its
numerous extinct craters, and the Bay of Gaëta as far as the distant
Ponza Islands (p. <a href='#Page_133'>133</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>When ladies are of the party we turn to the right, near the N.W.
angle of the monastery-wall, and descend a little to the (8 min.) gate of
the <i>Veduta Pagliana</i> (adm. 20 c.), where the view is similar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Travellers whose time is limited may at least visit the *<i>Strada
Nuova di Posílipo</i> (tramway No. 1; p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>). It is approached,
beyond the Villa Nazionale (p. <a href='#Page_141'>141</a>), by the Strada di Mergellina
(Pl. B, 7), from which the Corso Vittorio Emanuele (p. <a href='#Page_141'>141</a>) diverges.
The Strada Nuova di Posilipo, gradually ascending from
the sea, leads between villas with luxuriant gardens round the
broad hill of <i>Posílipo</i>, which bounds the Bay of Naples on the W.,
and offers, especially by evening light, superb views of Mt. Vesuvius,
the peninsula of Sorrento (p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>), and the island of Capri. A walk
of 10 min. straight on from the tramway-terminus brings us
through a cutting to the <i>Bella Vista</i>, a point of view near the
restaurant of that name (p. <a href='#Page_136'>136</a>), where we have an unimpeded
view of the bay of Pozzuoli and of the islands of Procida and
Ischia (p. <a href='#Page_135'>135</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>An interesting circular trip may be made from the Corso Vittorio
Emanuele (p. <a href='#Page_141'>141</a>), up the Via Tasso (Pl. C, B, 6), with its
fine points of view, to the top of Posilipo, then along the crest of
the hill to the S.W. to the tramway-terminus, and back by the
Posilipo road (a walk of 3½–4 hrs., or a drive of 1½ hr.; a cab
should be taken by the hour).</p>

<h3 class='c020'>25. From Genoa to Tunis viâ Leghorn and Cagliari.</h3>

<p class='c016'>620 M. This route forms part of the ‘Linea Circolare della Tunisia
e Tripolitania’ (Lines XVIII-XX) of the <i>Società Nazionale</i>, a circular
tour which offers interesting glimpses of Sardinia, Malta, and the E. coast
of Sicily, as well as of Oriental life at the N. African ports (RR. 64, 27, 24).
The steamers usually leave Genoa on Frid. evening, Leghorn on Sat.
night, and Cagliari on Mon. evening, and arrive at Tunis on Tues. forenoon.
(In the reverse direction they leave Tunis on Mon. at noon and reach
Genoa on Thurs. evening.) Fare 111 or 83 fr. (or for the whole round
303 or 212 fr.). As some of the steamers are hardly up to date, inquiry
as to the best should be made beforehand. Office at Genoa, see p. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>;
at Leghorn, Piazza Micheli (p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>); at Tunis, p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Genoa</i>, and voyage to (92 M.) <i>Leghorn</i>, comp. pp. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>, 134.
We pass <i>Melória</i>, a cliff 4 M. to the W. of Leghorn, off which the
Genoese destroyed the fleet of Pisa in 1284.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><b>Leghorn</b>, Ital. <i>Livorno</i> (Marble Palace Hotel; Hôt. d’Angleterre
&#38; Campari, Hôt. Giappone, both in Via Vittorio Emanuele,
with restaurants, good Italian houses for passing travellers; Brit,
cons., M. Carmichael; U. S. cons., E. A. Man; pop. 78,000), a provincial
capital, one of the chief seaports of Italy, and a sea-bathing
place, is quite a modern town. The harbour consists of the <i>Porto
Nuovo</i>, sheltered by a semicircular mole (<i>diga curvilinea</i>) and
the new <i>Molo Vegliaia</i>, and the old <i>Porto Mediceo</i>, or inner harbour.
(Landing or embarkation 1 fr.; trunk 30 c.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the harbour is the Piazza Micheli, adorned with a curious
monument of the grand-duke <i>Ferdinand I. of Tuscany</i> (1587–1609).
Straight on runs the Via Vittorio Emanuele, the main street, lined
with shops. It leads across the large Piazza Vittorio Emanuele,
which is flanked by the <i>Cathedral</i>, the <i>Municipio</i>, and other public
buildings, to the Piazza Carlo Alberto, whence the Via Garibaldi
and Via Palestro lead to the left to the railway-station.</p>

<p class='c011'>A pleasant walk (or tramway from the station to Antignano) is
offered by the <i>Viale Regina Margherita</i>, about 2 M. in length,
the seaside promenade to the S. of the town, in summer enlivened
by numerous bathers. Between it and the harbour, and adjoining
the Piazza Mazzini, is the <i>Cantiere Orlando</i>, the dockyards where
iron-clads and other vessels are built for the Italian navy.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S. end of the sea-promenade lie the villa-suburbs of <i>Ardenza</i>
and <i>Antignano</i>, which have sea-baths also.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the fine <span class='sc'>Voyage</span> from Leghorn to (339 M.) Cagliari we at
first obtain a good view of the <i>Tuscan Archipelago</i>, relics of the
primæval <i>Tyrrhenis</i> (p. xxxi). These islands are composed mainly
of granite, with slate and limestone strata overlying it in places.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing at some distance from the barren fisher-island of <i>Gorgona</i>
(837 ft.) and from <i>Capraia</i>, the <i>Capraria</i> (goats’ island) of
antiquity, we steer to the S.S.W. towards the W. coast of Elba,
enjoying in clear weather a fine distant *View of the peninsula of
<i>Cape Corse</i>, the N. extremity of <i>Corsica</i>, and of <i>Monte Cinto</i>
(8892 ft.), the highest mountain in the interior of that island.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next skirt the island of <i>Elba</i>, the <i>Æthalia</i> of the Greeks
and <i>Ilva</i> of the Romans, the largest island in the archipelago, 19 M.
long, famous as the scene of the first exile of Napoleon I. (1814–5).
The valuable iron-mines here (comp. pp. <a href='#Page_134'>134</a>, 135), worked from
very ancient times, are an important factor in the industries of
Italy. We pass the rocky N. coast of the island, which is visible
as far as the <i>Capo della Vita</i> (p. <a href='#Page_135'>135</a>), and on its W. side we
observe the massive granitic <i>Monte Capanne</i> (3343 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer passes between the hardly less steep S. coast of
Elba and the flat island of <i>Pianosa</i> (85 ft.; the ancient <i>Planasia</i>),
and steers to the S.S.W. towards the S. coast of Sardinia.
On the left, about 26 M. from Elba, appears the bold granitic island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of <i>Montecristo</i> (2126 ft.), the ancient <i>Oglasa</i>, the scene of
the well-known novel ‘The Count of Monte Cristo’, by Alex. Dumas.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Straits of Bonifacio</i> (p. <a href='#Page_133'>133</a>) lie far to the W. of the
steamer’s course. Off the N.E. coast of <i>Sardinia</i> we first sight the
massive rocky island of <i>Tavolara</i> (1821 ft.), the <i>Bucina</i> of the
Romans, masking the <i>Bay of Terranova</i>; then, when off <i>Capo Comino</i>,
the eastmost point of Sardinia, we see <i>Monte Alvo</i> (3701 ft.),
a little inland. The somewhat monotonous S.E. coast of the island
is backed by sterile mountains. We pass the little port of <i>Arbatax</i>
(<i>Tortolì Marina</i>), the <i>Capo di Bellavista</i>, the <i>Capo Sferra Cavallo</i>,
the <i>Monte Ferrau</i> (2878 ft.), the <i>Capo Ferrato</i>, and lastly
the islet of <i>Serpentara</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Capo Carbonara</i>, the S.E. point of Sardinia, and the
<i>Isola dei Cavoli</i> (p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>), opens the broad <i>Gulf of Cagliari</i> on
the flat S. coast of the island. On the hill-side at the head of the gulf,
beyond the fortified <i>Cape Sant’Elia</i>, which shuts off the inner
<i>Golfo di Quarto</i>, lies the town of <i>Cagliari</i>. Around it are several
large coast-lakes, the <i>Stagno di Molentargius</i>, on the E., the <i>Stagno

<p class='c009'><i>Cagliari</i>, Sardin. <i>Casteddu</i>, the Roman <i>Carales</i>, a very ancient
town, having been founded by the Phœnicians, now the seat of a
university and of an archbishop, with 48,000 inhab., lies in one of
the hottest and driest regions in Italy. At the foot of the <i>Castello</i> or
old town (290 ft.) lie the new quarters of <i>Villanova</i>, <i>Marina</i>, and
<i>Stampace</i>, adjoined on the W. by the suburb of <i>Sant’Avendrace</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Via Roma</span>, an avenue skirting the sea, the fashionable corso
in the evening, leads from the <i>Palazzo Comunale</i> to the Largo Carlo
Felice. On the right are two covered <i>Markets</i>, which are worth
seeing in the forenoon. This largo leads to the <span class='sc'>Piazza Yenne</span>,
the business centre of the modern town.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N. end of the Largo Carlo Felice rises a statue of <i>Charles
Felix I.</i> (1821–31), and in the Piazza Yenne an antique column.
Between these passes the main thoroughfare of the town: to the
left the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, ending near a group of ancient
Roman houses recently excavated, now called <i>Casa di Tigellio</i>; to
the right, leading to the upper town, the animated <span class='sc'>Via Manno</span>
(popularly ‘<i>La Costa</i>‘), with numerous shops, where among other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>things the gold ornaments commonly worn by the country-people
should be noticed.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza della Costituzione, at the S.E. end of the Via
Manno, the *<span class='sc'>Viale Regina Elena</span> runs to the N., beneath the precipitous
E. side of the abrupt Castello. It affords a fine view of
the ancient town-wall, of the cathedral, and of the picturesque rear
of the castle-buildings; below, on the right, lies Villanova, with its
quaint tiled roofs, while beyond it we have a splendid view of Cape
Sant’ Elia and across the wide plain of Quarto to the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the <i>Giardino Pubblico</i>, at the N. end of the promenade,
we mount to the W. to the <i>Passeggiata Buon Cammino</i> (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjoining the Via Manno (p. <a href='#Page_144'>144</a>) is the small Piazzetta de’Martiri
d’Italia, whence the Via Giuseppe Mazzini ascends in two bends
to the *<i>Castello</i>, still fortified in mediæval style. At the top is the
new <i>Passeggiata Coperta</i>, one of the finest points in the town. The
Via dell’Università leads hence to the left to the <i>University</i> and to
the ponderous <i>Torre dell’Elefante</i>, which, according to the inscription,
was erected by the Pisans in 1307.</p>

<p class='c011'>Straight on we pass through the <i>Torre dell’Aquila</i>, an old
gateway now enclosed within the <i>Palazzo Boyl</i>, to the <span class='sc'>Via Lamarmora</span>,
the main street in the Castello, which is connected with the
parallel streets by steep lanes, dark vaulted passages, and steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the terraced little Piazza del Municipio, with the council-hall
of the old town, a flight of steps to the right ascends to the
<i>Cathedral</i> (Santa Cecilia), completed by the Pisans in 1312, but
since then frequently altered. A new façade, in keeping with the
old building, is now under construction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther to the N., in the Piazza dell’ Indipendenza, is the Pisan
<i>Torre San Pancrazio</i> (14th cent.), a modern addition to which
contains the very notable <span class='sc'>Museum of Antiquities</span> (if closed apply
to the director, Sig. Nissardi). Besides Phœnician and Roman
antiquities we may note the cork model of a nuraghe, one of the
conical fortresses built by the aboriginal Iberian inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Going through the <i>Citadel</i>, which bounds the Castello on the N.,
we follow the <i>Passeggiata Buon Cammino</i> to the Piazza d’Armi.
Just beyond the barracks a road to the left leads to the Roman—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Amphitheatre</i> (greater diameter 97, smaller 80 yds.; arena
55 by 37 yds.), with tiers of seats mostly hewn in the rock.</p>

<p class='c011'>Below the amphitheatre lie the garden of the <i>Poor House</i> (Ricovero
di Mendicità) and the <i>Botanic Garden</i> (Thurs. 4–7), both
containing remains of antique <i>Irrigation Works</i>, which are continued
on the cliffs to the N.W. of the old town. Close by is the ancient
<span class='sc'>Necropolis</span> of Carales. Nearest the town are the Punic tomb-chambers,
sunk perpendicularly in the rock (care should be taken here),
and farther to the W. are the mostly horizontal Roman tombs.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the ruined castle of <i>San Michele</i>, at the top of a hill about 2 M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>to the N. of the Piazza d’Armi (p. <a href='#Page_145'>145</a>), we overlook the <i>Stagno di
Cagliari</i> (p. <a href='#Page_144'>144</a>) and the <i>Campidano</i>, a fruitful, but fever-stricken plain
between the bays of Cagliari and Oristano (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>), where the clay-built
villages and the cactus hedges recall N. Africa.</p>

In the forenoon, <i>Monreale</i> (p. <a href='#Page_152'>152</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Palermo</i>, the capital of Sicily, with 250,000 inhab., the seat of
an archbishop and a university, lies on the beautiful bay named
after it, in the midst of the <i>Conca d’Oro</i>, a fertile plain artificially
watered, and yielding oranges, lemons, mandarins, and other fruits
in profusion. Palermo is also the chief seaport in the island, whence
fruit, wine, sumach, and the sulphur of S. Sicily (79% of the
world’s consumption) are largely exported.</p>

<p class='c011'>The city, the <i>Panormus</i> of antiquity, began its career as a
Phœnician colony; it next became the capital of the island under
the Carthaginian domination, but was conquered by the Romans in
254 B. C. Next came the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines, who were
succeeded by the Aglabides and Fatimites (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), who again
made the town the capital of the island under the name of <i>Balerm</i>,
and opened up Sicily to Moorish culture. When Palermo became
the residence of its Norman conquerors (1072–1194) they erected
castles and churches, partly employing Arabian architects and artificers,
whose work shows a charming blend of Byzantine, Arabian,
and Oriental features. Later, as the favourite seat of the Hohenstaufen
(1194–1266), Palermo attained the zenith of its glory. The
old town, however, owes its architectural character to the Spanish
viceroys (16–17th cent.), who chose it as their residence in spite
of the protests of Messina. Since the union of Sicily with the kingdom
of Italy (1860) there has been a great revival of building
enterprise, with the result that broad streets and villa-suburbs
have sprung up, particularly on the N. side of the old town.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Santa Lucia Pier (Pl. G, 4, 5) we enter the old town
by the Via Francesco Crispi (Pl. F, E, 4; tramway No. 1, see p. <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>),
leading to the old Porta San Giorgio (Pl. E, 4). The Via Cavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>diverges here to the right to the old Porta Maqueda (p. <a href='#Page_151'>151</a>); we
turn to the left, cross the Piazza del Castello (Pl. D, 5), pass the
old Fort Castellammare, and skirt the Cala (p. <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>), or old harbour,
a little beyond which is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Piazza Marina</span> (Pl. C, 5), where the beautiful *<i>Giardino Garibaldi</i>
recalls the tropics with its luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the N.E. of the Giardino is the Porta Felice (Pl.
C, 5, 6; p. <a href='#Page_151'>151</a>), from which to the Porta Nuova (Pl. B, 1; p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>),
over 1 M. distant, runs the <span class='sc'>Corso Vittorio Emanuele</span>, intersecting
the whole of the old town. This long street owes its present form
to Don Pedro de Toledo (p. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>), but having been for centuries the
route from the harbour to the castle, it has retained its old popular
name of <i>Cássaro</i> (from the Arabic <i>kasr</i>, castle).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the <i>Quattro Canti</i> (Pl. C, 3), the old business centre of the
city, the Corso is crossed by the <span class='sc'>Via Maqueda</span> (Pl. A-D, 4, 3;
p. <a href='#Page_151'>151</a>), begun by the viceroy Marqués de Villena in 1609, and now
a second important artery of the old town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Corso leads to the Piazza del Duomo, on the N. side of
which rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. C, 2), dedicated to the <i>Assunta</i>, on the site
of an older church which the Moors had converted into a mosque.
The original Romanesque building, erected by Archbishop Walter
of the Mill (Gualterio Offamilio) after 1185, has been entirely transformed
in the course of centuries, with the exception of the lower
part of the clock-tower and the external decoration of the choir
niche. The handsome W. façade with the two towers which date
from 1300–59, the incongruous dome, and the modernized internal
decorations are the work of the Florentine <i>Fern. Fuga</i> (1781–1801).
The right aisle, on the left of the S. portal, contains the *Monuments
of Norman and Hohenstaufen monarchs.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S.W. end of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, beyond the
Piazza della Vittoria (Pl. B, 2), on a slight eminence, which from
the earliest times has been the site of the castle, rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Palazzo Reale</b> (Pl. B, 1), which still bears traces of its original
fortified character, although the foundation walls alone are
Arabian, and the central tower with the pointed arch (Santa Ninfa,
p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>) is the only relic of the Norman part of the building.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last door on the left, opposite the monument of Philip V.,
leads into the palace-yard (sticks and umbrellas are left with the
porter; guide ½ fr., but quite unnecessary). We ascend the stairs
to the left, on the first floor turn to the right, and pass through
the arcaded passage to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<i>Cappella Palatina</i>, a perfect gem of mediæval art, built by
king Roger II. in 1132–40 in the Arabic-Norman style (adm.
daily 7 to 10.30 free; later, week-days till 4, Sun. till 3, fee; best
light in the morning). In the interior the chapel is a basilica with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>two aisles; including the choir and apse it is 36 yds. long and
14 yds. in breadth. The Arabian pointed arches are borne by ten
antique columns; the central dome, 59 ft. high, is adorned with
Greek and Latin inscriptions. The beautiful Arabian timber ceiling
in the nave, with its Cufic (early Arabic) inscription, is joined to
the walls by stalactite vaulting. All the walls are incrusted with
glass-mosaics on a gold ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>The palace-tower, <i>Santa Ninfa</i>, now an observatory, is famed
for the delightful panorama it affords (fee ½–1 fr.; not always
accessible). The top of the <i>Porta Nuova</i> (Pl. B, 1), close by, also
overlooks the city and the Conca d’Oro.</p>

<p class='c011'>Descending the steps by the monument of Philip V., we now
follow the Via del Bastione a Porta di Castro and the Via dei Benedettini
to the ruined church of *<i>San Giovanni degli Eremiti</i>
(Pl. A, B, 1, 2; adm. by the garden-gate; fee 25 c.). The interior
is in the form of a so-called Egyptian cross (p. <a href='#Page_376'>376</a>), with three
apses. The nave is divided into two squares by a pointed arch.
Quite an Oriental effect is produced by the five unadorned domes,
which are best viewed from the pretty cloisters (now a garden).
Adjoining the S. side of the church is a dilapidated little mosque.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to the Quattro Canti (p. <a href='#Page_149'>149</a>) and turn to the
right into the Via Maqueda. Here, immediately on the right, is the
<i>University</i> (Pl. C, 3); on the left is the <i>Palazzo di Città</i> or <i>Municipio</i>.
Just beyond the latter is the small Piazza Bellini, whence
steps ascend to two old Norman churches (adm. daily 9–4, 1 fr.;
Sun. free). The smaller, <i>San Cataldo</i>, of 1161, is crowned with
Arabian pinnacles. Still more curious is the larger church—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<i>La Martorana</i> (Pl. B, C, 4), named after its founder, the
Greek admiral of Roger I. (1143), and known also as Santa Maria
dell’ Ammiraglio, a Byzantine edifice with Norman additions, now
suitably restored. The two lower stories of the clock-tower are
part of the original church.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, a little to the E. of the
Quattro Canti, runs the new Via Roma (Pl. C, D, 4) to the N.N.W. to
the Piazza San Domenico. On the E. side of this piazza rises the
large church of <i>San Domenico</i> (Pl. D, 4), containing monuments to
many eminent Sicilians.—Behind the church, in the Via Bambinai,
is the <i>Oratorio del Santissimo Rosario</i> (keys at No. 16, adjacent),
containing a fine Madonna del Rosario by A. van Dyck.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza San Domenico the Via Monteleone leads to the
N.W. to the Piazza dell’ Olivella, where an old monastery on the
right contains the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Museo Nazionale</b> (Pl. D, 3; week-days 10–3, 1 fr.; Sun. 11–3,
free, but not fully shown; closed on high festivals, on the last three
days of the Carnival, and in Holy Week).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span><span class='sc'>Ground Floor.</span> From the Primo Cortile, containing mediæval and Renaissance
portals, sculptures, and inscriptions, we enter the Secondo Cortile
(once the cloisters), where ancient sculptures and inscriptions are exhibited,
on the left Sicilian, on the right those of foreign or uncertain origin.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the vestibule, beyond the cloisters, we pass through a small
room, containing two Phœnician sarcophagi found near Palermo, to the
Sala di Panormo, with mosaics and inscriptions from Panormus, and opposite
to it the Sala del Fauno, so named from the fine satyr in the style of
Praxiteles which it contains.</p>

<p class='c022'>The adjoining Sala di Selinunte contains the celebrated *Metopes of
Selinus (p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>). On the left, between parts of the ponderous entablature
of the oldest temple, are three rude and primitive metopes of the beginning
of the 6th cent. B. C. (quadriga, beheading of Medusa, Hercules and the
Cercopes); then the lower halves of two metopes, dating from about
the middle of the 6th cent. (battle of the gods and the giants); on the
back-wall four metopes of the early 5th cent., a period just before the
prime of Greek art (Hercules slaying the queen of the Amazons, Hera
unveiling herself before Zeus, Actæon torn to pieces by the dogs of Artemis,
Athene slaying a giant).</p>

<p class='c022'>The stairs in the forecourt ascend to the—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>First Floor.</span> The steps to the left lead to the Sala Arăba, which
contains Arabian and Arab-Norman antiquities found in Sicily (door-frame
from the Martorana monastery, earthenware vase from Mazzara) and early
Arabian objects from Cairo. The Corridoio di Ponente contains painted
female figures (4th–3rd cent. B. C.), similar to the terracottas of Tanagra.
Beyond the cloisters is the room of the ancient bronzes, among which we
note a fountain-group of Hercules and the Cerynæan hind, from Pompeii,
and a ram marvellously lifelike. Next come two rooms on the left with
Greek vases. From the corridor on the opposite side we enter the Gabinetto
di Numismatica, an admirable collection of the ancient coins of Sicily
and of antique trinkets. The last room contains gorgeous church vestments.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the <span class='sc'>Second Floor</span> is the Gallery of Pictures, chiefly by Sicilian
masters (<i>Pietro Novelli</i> and others); a small winged altar-piece by <i>Jan
Mabuse</i> (1501?), a gem of Netherlandish art, should, however, be noted.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Museum the Via della Bara leads to the W. to the
<span class='sc'>Piazza Giuseppe Verdi</span> (Pl. D, 3), in which rises the <i>Teatro
Massimo</i> or <i>Vittorio Emanuele</i>, the largest in Italy.—At the N.
end of the Via Maqueda (p. <a href='#Page_149'>149</a>) is the old Porta Maqueda (Pl. D,
E, 3), whence the Via Ruggiero Settimo leads into the broad—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Via della Libertà</span> (Pl. F, G, 3, 2), a fashionable evening
promenade, ending at the pretty <i>Giardino Inglese</i> (Pl. G, H, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Marina</span>, officially named <i>Foro Umberto Primo</i> (Pl. C, B, 6),
which begins at the <i>Porta Felice</i> (Pl. C, 5, 6; p. <a href='#Page_149'>149</a>), near the
harbour, affords a superb walk and is a favourite resort on summer
evenings after 6 (music at 9).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S. end of the Marina lies the *<b>Villa Giulia</b> or <i>Flora</i>
(Pl. A, B, 6), one of the most beautiful public gardens in Italy,
where the blossoming trees diffuse their fragrance in spring far
around. It is adjoined on the W. by the *<i>Botanic Garden</i> (Pl. A, B, 6;
gardener 25–50 c.), almost vying with the famous Jardin d’Essai at
Algiers (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>A visit to *<b>Monte Pellegrino</b> (1968 ft.), the ancient <i>Heirkte</i>,
a bare limestone hill to the N. of Palermo, should not be omitted
in clear weather. (Tramway No. 4 to <i>Falde</i>, near the S. foot of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the hill, see p. <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>; donkey, ordered in the town beforehand,
with attendant, 4 fr.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The zigzag path, visible from the town, ascends in about 1½ hr.
from the Punta di Bersaglio, 5 min. to the N. of Falde, to the <i>Grotto
of St. Rosalia</i> (d. about 1170), which has been well described by
Goethe. Near it are a cottage, where bread and wine may be obtained
(bargaining advisable), and the restaurant <i>Argos-Eden</i> (open
only on Sun.).</p>

<p class='c011'>A steep footpath ascends thence in ½ hr. to the <i>Telégrafo</i>,
the signal-station on the summit, where we enjoy a *View of the
beautiful basin of Palermo, of the indented N. coast of Sicily, and
of the Lipari Islands (p. <a href='#Page_146'>146</a>). To the E., beyond the Madoníe
(p. <a href='#Page_146'>146</a>) and the distant Nebrodian Mts., towers Mt. Ætna.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Monreale</span> (tramway No. 9 and carr., see pp. <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>, 148) is reached
from the Porta Nuova (Pl. B, 1; p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>) by the Corso Calatafími.
Beyond (3 M.) <i>La Rocca</i> the road ascends to the (¾ hr.) top of the
‘royal hill’ (1148 ft.). The town of <b>Monreale</b> (Restaur. Savoy,
Eden; pop. 24,000) owes its origin to a Benedictine abbey, founded
by William II. (1174), and to the famous cathedral (1174–89) built
here as the seat of the second archbishopric in the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<i>Cathedral</i> is a Norman Romanesque basilica consisting
of nave, aisles, and three apses, 335 ft. long and 131 ft. wide. Externally
the choir end of the church, with its Arabian pointed arches
and mosaic decoration, is particularly fine. The magnificent main
portal, flanked in northern style with two square towers, has two
admirable bronze doors by ‘Bonannus Civis Pisanus’ (1186). The
doors of the side-portal are by Barisano. The pointed arches of
the nave rest on granite columns, and all the walls are lavishly
decorated with glass mosaics. The roof (172 steps; verger, who
shows the chapels also, 50–75 c.) commands a splendid view.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the Benedictine monastery nothing is now left except the
*<i>Cloisters</i>, the pointed arches of which are adorned with mosaics
and borne by 216 columns in pairs, remarkable for the variety of
their capitals and for the inlaid ornamentation of their shafts (date
ca. 1200). Entrance (1 fr.) from the Piazza del Duomo by the side-door
to the left. The custodian shows also the garden of the monastery,
where we have a charming view of Palermo.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>Pursuing our <span class='sc'>Voyage to Tunis</span> we soon obtain a fine view of the
bold limestone rocks of <i>Monte Pellegrino</i> (p. <a href='#Page_151'>151</a>). We next pass
the beautiful <i>Bay of Mondello</i> and the <i>Cape Gallo</i> and steer to the
W., away from the Sicilian coast and the <i>Gulf of Castellammare</i>.
That spacious gulf is bounded on the E. by the <i>Punta di Raisi</i>, a
spur of <i>Monte Orso</i> (2900 ft.), and on the W. by the mountains of
<i>San Vito</i> (<i>Monte Sparagio</i> and others).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Beyond <i>Cape San Vito</i> (lighthouse) appear to the <i>S.W. Monte
San Giuliano</i> (see below) and the <i>Ægadean Islands</i>. The French
steamers bound for Tunis direct pass near these islands; first
<i>Lévanzo</i> (951 ft.; ancient <i>Phorbantia</i>), beyond which to the S. is
<i>Favignana</i> (1070 ft.; ancient <i>Ægusa</i>), the largest of the group;
then <i>Marittimo</i> (ancient <i>Hiera</i>), with <i>Monte Falcone</i> (2245 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian steamer coming from Naples rounds <i>Monte San
Giuliano</i> (2464 ft.), a solitary mass of Jurassic rock, the ancient
<i>Eryx</i>, famed for its temple of Venus Erycina, and highly revered
by all the Mediterranean peoples, and next calls at—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Trápani</b> (Grand-Hôtel, on the quay; landing or embarkation,
without baggage, 60 c.; Brit. vice-consul, G. Marino), the ancient
<i>Drepana</i> (from <i>drepanon</i>, a sickle), so called from the form of
the peninsula. Down to the first Punic war this was merely the
port of the ancient <i>Eryx</i>, but it is now a thriving commercial
place (pop. 38,000). The chief export is the sea-salt yielded by
the extensive evaporation grounds on the W. coast, towards Marsala.
The coral-fishery also is an important industry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Naples steamer next passes through the strait between the
islands of <i>Levanzo</i> and <i>Favignana</i> (see above) and the flat W. coast
of Sicily, and then steers to the S.W. through the <i>Straits of Pantelleria</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_396'>396</a>), between Favignana and the <i>Isola Grande</i>, towards
<i>Cape Bon</i> (Arabic <i>Râs Addar</i>, the Roman <i>Promontorium Mercurii</i>),
the E. boundary of the <i>Bay of Tunis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>). High up
on this bold headland stands a lighthouse (410 ft.), visible for
32 M. around, one of the most important landmarks for mariners
between Gibraltar and Egypt. Beyond the cape rises <i>Jebel Abiod</i>
(1273 ft.), with its semaphore. The islands to the W. are <i>Zembretta</i>
and <i>Zembra</i> or <i>Jamur</i> (1420 ft.; the ancient <i>Ægimurus</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The great quarries near <i>El-Aouaria</i> (the ancient <i>Aquilaria</i>),
between Cape Bon and the <i>Râs el-Ahmar</i> (318 ft.) yielded the
Phœnicians the material for building Carthage. We next pass the
<i>Anse de Thonaire</i>, with its important tunny-fishery (Ital. <i>tonnara</i>),
and the <i>Râs al-Fortas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamers usually enter the <i>Inner Bay of Tunis</i> and <i>Lake
Bahira</i> in the early morning. <i>Tunis</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_329'>329</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Italian Cargo-Steamers</span> (p. <a href='#Page_146'>146</a>) first touch at <i>Castellammare
del Golfo</i>, then proceed to <i>Trapani</i> (see above), where they spend the
night. They next pass <i>Favignana</i> (see above), <i>Isola Grande</i>, the lagoon
of <i>Lo Stagnone</i>, and <i>Capo Boeo</i> or <i>Lilibeo</i>, the W. extremity of Sicily.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Marsála</b> (Albergo Centrale; Leone; Stella d’Italia; landing or embarkation
60 c.; with heavy baggage 1½ fr.; Brit. vice-consul, Chas. F. Gray;
pop. 58,000) is a busy trading town, well known for its fiery wines. It
occupies the site of <i>Lilybaeum</i>, the chief fortress of Carthage in Sicily.
The modern name is of Moorish origin (<i>Marsa-Ali</i>, harbour of Ali).</p>

<p class='c022'>Skirting the monotonous S.W. coast of Sicily the vessel next calls
at <b>Mazzara del Vallo</b> (Alb. Centrale; Alb. Stella; Brit. vice-consul,
O. Favara), founded as <i>Mazara</i> by the Greeks of Selinus, but destroyed
along with its mother-city by the Carthaginians in 409 B. C.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Beyond Mazzara we pass the <i>Punta di Granítola</i>, the <i>Râs el-Belât</i>
of the Moors, who in 827 began their victorious progress through the
island, and the broad bay of <i>Selinunte</i> (<i>Selinus</i>), where the grandest ruined
temples in Europe are situated. Beyond <i>Cape San Marco</i> we come to—</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Sciacca</b> (Nuova Italia; pop. 25,000), a seaport situated on a steep
hill, 262 ft. above the sea, with its mouldering castles of mediæval nobility.
The name was originally Arabic, <i>Shâkkah</i>. In ancient times it
was called <i>Thermae Selinuntiae</i>, from the already famous vapour-baths
in the caverns at the foot of <i>Monte San Calógero</i> (1272 ft.) and the hot
salt-springs (132° Fahr.).</p>

<p class='c022'>The steamer next steers to the W.S.W. through the <i>Straits of Pantelleria</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_396'>396</a>), at a little distance from the shallows where the volcanic
<i>Isola Ferdinandea</i>, 4–5 M. in circumference, rose from the sea with a
crater, on 18th July, 1831, but disappeared on 12th Jan., 1832.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the margin of the shallower water, in a great submarine basin
3900 ft. deep, lies the island of <b>Pantelleria</b>, also belonging to Italy.
Its chief town, off which the steamer anchors for some hours, is on the
N.W. side. This volcanic island, 32 sq. M. in area, culminates in an
extinct crater 2743 ft. in height, while numerous ‘fumaroli’, or smoking
and steaming fissures, and hot mineral springs testify to a continuous
volcanic activity. This was further indicated by a submarine eruption
which occurred in 1891, within 3 M. of the island to the N.W.</p>

<p class='c022'>The steamer afterwards rounds <i>Cape Bon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_153'>153</a>) and follows the
same course to Tunis as the larger passenger steamers.</p>

N. coast of the island of <i>Capri</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>After 1¼ hr. we pass through the <i>Bocca Piccola</i>, a strait 3 M.
in breadth, between the huge cliffs of <i>Lo Capo</i>, the N.E. point of
Capri, and the <i>Punta di Campanella</i> (154 ft.; lighthouse), the

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The steamboat now proceeds to the S.S.E. towards the straits of
Messina. We have a fine view, in passing, of the <i>Punta Tragara</i>,
the S.E. headland of Capri, with the cliffs of the <i>Faraglioni</i>, and
of the precipitous <i>Monte Soláro</i> (1920 ft.), the highest hill in the
island. On our left lies the broad <i>Gulf of Salerno</i>, with the bays
of <i>Positano</i> and <i>Amalfi</i> on the S. side of the peninsula of Sorrento.
Conspicuous among the Neapolitan Apennines are the spurs of
<i>Monte Stella</i> (3708 ft.) with the <i>Punta Licosa</i>, and of <i>Monte
Bulgheria</i> (4016 ft.) with <i>Cape Palinuro</i> (lighthouse).</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, far off the coast of <i>Calabria</i>, we sight to the S. the
volcanic <i>Lipari</i> or <i>Æolian Islands</i>, the ancient <i>Liparaeae</i> or
<i>Æoliae</i>. We pass close to <i>Strómboli</i>, the <i>Strongyle</i> of the Greeks,
which the ancients regarded as the seat of Æolus, god of the winds.
This island culminates in a peak (3038 ft.) with a crater on its N.
side, often shrouded in smoke, which is one of the few constantly
active volcanoes in Europe. To the S.W. we descry in clear weather
<i>Panária</i> (1381 ft.), with its archipelago of smaller islands; <i>Lípari</i>,
the largest of the group with <i>Monte Sant’Angelo</i> (1955 ft.); and
<i>Vulcano</i> with its ever smoking crater (1638 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Off <i>Cape Vaticano</i> (lighthouse), a spur of the Calabrian coast-hills
between the bays of <i>Sant’Eufemia</i> and <i>Gioia</i>, we sight the N.
coast of Sicily, with the <i>Monti Peloritani</i>, the <i>Myconius Mons</i> or
<i>Mons Neptuni</i> of the Romans, overtopped by <i>Mt. Ætna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>).
On the Calabrian coast, near the strait which was the chief scene
of the earthquake of 1908 (p. <a href='#Page_156'>156</a>), appear the ruins of the little
town of <i>Palmi</i>, halfway up <i>Monte Elia</i> (1900 ft.; a famous point of
view), and those of <i>Bagnara</i> and of <i>Scilla</i> with its castle-rock.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *Voyage through the <i>Straits of Messina</i> (Faro or Stretto
di Messina), the <i>Fretum Siculum</i> of antiquity, is one of the most
beautiful in the Mediterranean. Both banks are luxuriantly fertile,
shaded with palms, and yielding oranges, pomegranates, and prickly
pears. The Calabrian coast, thickly studded with villages, partly
in ruins, culminates in <i>Montalto</i> (5424 ft.), the highest peak of the
wooded <i>Aspromonte</i>, the ancient <i>Sila</i>, while we survey the Sicilian
coast as far as <i>Mt. Ætna</i>. The narrowest part of the straits, 2 M.,
is between the <i>Punta del Faro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>) and the <i>Punta Pezzo</i>,
where they are entered from the <i>Tyrrhenian Sea</i>; between Messina
and Villa San Giovanni (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>) they are 4½ M., and between <i>Capo
di Scaletta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>) and the <i>Punta di Péllaro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>) in the <i>Ionian
Sea</i> 8¾ M. wide. The currents which sweep past the headland
of Scilla (see above) and cause strong eddies near the harbour of
Messina, sometimes augmented by gales, gave rise at a very early
period to the legend of Scylla and Charybdis, and Homer has described
Scylla as a roaring, all-devouring sea-monster.</p>

<p class='c011'>We pass the lighthouses of the Punta del Faro and the Punta
di Pezzo. Nearing the <i>Harbour of Messina</i>, in a bay formed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a sickle-shaped peninsula, we survey the ruins of the city on the
green slopes of the Monti Peloritani (p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>), whose fissured peaks
tower above the sea of houses, once so picturesque.</p>

<p class='c011'>The central point of the earthquake of Messina (28th Dec., 1908),
caused by dislocation or subsidence, was the strait and the W. slope
of Aspromonte (p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>). The first terrific shock at 5 a.m. was followed
almost immediately by a great tidal wave caused by a submarine
earthquake, and aggravating the calamity in the lower parts
of the coast towns and villages. The effects of the earthquake were
disastrous also in Calabria as far to the N. as Cosenza, and in Sicily
as far to the S. as Pachino (near Cape Passero; p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>). At Messina
the sea-wave rose to a height of 8–9 ft., at Reggio 11½ ft., and at
Giardini and Riposto 19½–20 ft. The area of the seismic disturbance
extended to the N.E. to Pizzo on the bay of Sant’Eufemia
(p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>), to the E. to the mouth of the Amendolea, near Cape
Spartivento and the small town of Ferruzzano, the scene of the
earthquake of 1907, and to the S. to Riposto (p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>). It was estimated
that 96,000 persons lost their lives. The value of the
buildings destroyed amounted to about 6,500,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The town of <i>Messina</i> was like Reggio completely destroyed
by the earthquake of 1908 (comp. above) and has now only 80,000
inhab. as against 110,000 in 1908. Notwithstanding this catastrophe
it was finally decided in autumn 1909 to rebuild the town
on its former site. Its harbour, one of the best in the Mediterranean,
the third in importance in Sicily, sustained no damage and
has even now a very brisk trade (1908: 3589 vessels of 2,598,647
tons burden; 1910: 3148 vessels of 2,050,733 tons burden). The
great charm of Messina consists in the beauty of its environs and
the views they afford, particularly of the Calabrian coast by
evening light.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Originally named <i>Zancle</i> (<i>i.e.</i> sickle), Messina was one of the earliest
of the Greek colonies in Sicily, having been founded about 730 B.C. Early
in the 5th cent. it was occupied by new colonists from the Messenian Reggio
(p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>) and called <i>Messana</i>. From the earliest times the Messenians took
a leading part in almost all the political agitations in the island. In 228
the Mamertines, disbanded mercenaries of Agathocles (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>), treacherously
seized the town and soon afterwards invoked the aid of the Romans
against Hannibal, thus directly giving rise to the first Punic war. For a
time Messina enjoyed the special favour of the Romans, and even of
Verres, the notorious proconsul, but when it became the naval base of
Pompey, in 36 B.C., it was plundered by the soldiers of Octavian. From
the period of the Crusades, by which Sicily was partly affected, date the
privileges which made Messina a kind of free city and the seat of the Sicilian
opposition to foreign domination. The failure of its war against Spain
(1672–8), notwithstanding the help of French troops sent by Louis XIV.
and two naval victories won by Admiral Duquesne over the Spanish-Dutch
fleet under De Ruyter (1676), caused the downfall of the city.
Terrible pestilences (the plague in 1740 and cholera in 1854), severe earthquakes
(in 1783 and 1894), and the bombardment of the town by the
Neapolitan fleet (in 1818) had already seriously injured Messina prior to
its recent appalling calamity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ruins extend along the shore to the N., from the ‘sickle’
of the harbour and the citadel, to the <i>Giardino a Mare</i>, under
whose plane-trees is a <i>Camp</i> for the destitute. The <i>Citadel</i> itself,
with its broad moats and its bastions, is still standing.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Marina or Corso Vittorio Emanuele (formerly called
also <i>La Palazzata</i>) are still seen several palatial façades, interrupted
by archways and passages leading to the parallel Via Garibaldi.
These are mostly relics of a uniform row of palaces, erected
after the earthquake of 1783. Opposite the ruined Palazzo Municipale
rises the <i>Neptune Fountain</i>, by Montorsoli, a pupil of
Michael Angelo (1557), with a colossal statue of Neptune between
Scylla and Charybdis.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the Via Garibaldi lies the Piazza del Duomo, with
the almost intact <i>Orion Fountain</i> by Montorsoli (1547–51), a point
which may be reached direct from the Dogana by the Via Primo
Settembre. The <i>Cathedral</i> (la Matrice), founded by the Normans
in 1098, is now, with the exception of the choir niche, a mass of
ruins. The short Via Università degli Studi led to the S.E. from
this piazza to the <i>University</i>, now also destroyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the S. of the University, in the coast-plain called
the <i>Mosella</i>, between the <i>Torrente Portalegni</i> and the <i>Torrente
Zaera</i>, and beyond the ruins of the new quarters of the town, lies
the main <i>Camp</i> of wooden barracks for the homeless, flanking the
Viale San Martino.</p>

<p class='c016'>A good survey of the ruins, as well as a superb view of the straits, is
obtained from the old <b>Forte Castellaccio</b>, which, along with the modern
forts, the barracks of the mountain-artillery, and the powder-magazine,
has escaped destruction. The way to it (35–40 min.) is up the Torrente
Portalegni close to ruined houses; we then skirt the Botanic Garden,
cross the Piazza Venti Settembre occupied by barracks, and ascend straight
on the steep Via Castellaccio.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The beautiful <span class='sc'>Excursion to the Punta del Faro</span> (cab, see
p. <a href='#Page_156'>156</a>; bargain advisable) affords a good survey of the devastated
environs. The road leads from the Giardino a Mare (p. <a href='#Page_157'>157</a>) and the
camp called <i>Villaggio Regina Elena</i>, along the foot of the hills, past
luxuriant orchards, and through the ruined fishing-villages of <i>Salvatore
dei Greci</i>, <i>Paradiso</i>, and <i>Pace</i>; it then skirts two lagoons,
the <i>Pantano Grande</i>, or <i>Lago di Ganzirri</i>, below the ruins of
<i>Faro Superiore</i>, a village famed for its wine, and the <i>Pantano
Piccolo</i>. On the <i>Punta del Faro</i> or <i>Capo Peloro</i> (once <i>Promontorium
Pelorum</i>), the N.E. point of Sicily, are the ruins of the
fishing-village of <i>Faro</i> or <i>Torre del Faro</i>, and near it the quite
intact <b>Lighthouse</b> (200 steps; keeper 50 c.), which commands
a splendid *View of the Lipari Islands and the Calabrian coast as
far as Cape Vaticano (comp. p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>).</p>

(comp. p. <a href='#Page_156'>156</a>); the morning train, which runs to Syracuse harbour, has a
dining-car (déj. 2½ fr.). The train skirts the coast, affording fine views;
it crosses the stony channels of several <i>torrenti</i> or <i>flumare</i>, which are
generally dry, and pierces a number of headlands by means of tunnels.</p>

crowded from 15th Jan. to April and closed in summer; plainer, San Giorgio,
Victoria, Naumachia, etc.; Brit. vice-cons., Dr. S. Cacciola-Cartella; pop.
4000), the ancient <i>Tauromenium</i>, a highly picturesque little town, lies
on the S.E. spurs of <i>Monte Venere</i> (2900 ft.), and is overlooked by a
ruined <i>Castle</i> (1300 ft.) and by the village of <i>Mola</i> (2083 ft.). Its chief
attraction is the *<i>Ancient Theatre</i>, at the E. end of the town, which is
open daily till dusk. Originally Greek it was entirely remodelled in the
Roman period. The spectators’ area (<i>cavea</i>), almost wholly hewn in the
rock, is 357 ft. in diameter, and the <i>orchestra</i> (seats for persons of distinction)
115 ft.; the stage (<i>pulpitum</i>) is particularly well preserved. The
*View from the site of the theatre is one of the most beautiful in Italy,
especially in the morning, when the sun rises above Calabria or, in winter,
from the sea, imparting a rosy hue to the snowy peak of Mt. Ætna
(p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>), and gilding the rocky heights beyond the theatre.</p>

<p class='c022'>Between Taormina and Catania the train crosses a number of the lava-streams
descending from Mt. Ætna. On the northmost of these, near
<i>Schisò</i>, between the bay of Giardini and the mouth of the <i>Alcántara</i>
(Arabic al-kántara, the bridge), lay Naxos, founded in 735 B. C., the
oldest Greek colony in Sicily.</p>

<p class='c022'>41 M. <i>Giarre-Riposto</i>, the station for the country-town of <i>Giarre</i>
and for the seaport of <i>Riposto</i> which has a brisk trade in wine. It is

(‘Ferrovia Circumetnéa’; 68½ M. in length).</p>

<p class='c022'>51 M. <i>Acireale</i> (525 ft.; Sicil. <i>Iaci</i>), a wealthy country-town built on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>several lava-streams and much frequented as a bathing-place on account
of its mineral springs (sulphur, salt, and iodine).—Near (55½ M.) <i>Aci
Castello</i> we perceive on the left in the sea seven cliffs of columnar basalt,
the <i>Scogli de’ Ciclopi</i> or Islands of Cyclops, the rocks which according
to Greek myth the blinded Polyphemus hurled after the crafty Ulysses.</p>

<p class='c022'>59½ M. <b>Catania</b>, see p. <a href='#Page_160'>160</a>.</p>

<p class='c022'>Running inland the train enters the <i>Piana di Catania</i>, the plain of
the rivers <i>Simeto</i> and <i>Gornalunga</i>, which is often flooded in winter. This
was the region of the <i>Laestrygonian Fields</i> of antiquity, extolled by Cicero
as the ‘uberrima Siciliæ pars’, and still the granary of the island. To the
right, beyond the <i>Monti Cartina</i>, in a malarious district lies the <i>Lago
di Lentini</i>, the largest lake in Sicily. On the left, beyond (77½ M.)
<i>Lentini</i>, Greek <i>Leontinoi</i>, is the swampy lagoon <i>Pantano di Carlentini</i>.
We pass numerous salt-works and snow-white pyramids of sea-salt.</p>

<p class='c022'>94 M. <i>Augusta</i> (the ancient <i>Xiphonia</i>), a seaport with 16,000 inhab.,
lies in a site similar to that of Syracuse, on the N. margin of the <i>Bay
of Megara</i>, which is bounded by the headlands of <i>Santa Croce</i> and <i>Santa
Panagia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_162'>162</a>). 98½ M. <i>Mégara Iblea</i>, not far from the site of the Greek
colony of <i>Megara Hyblea</i>. On the left is the <i>Penisola Magnisi</i>, the
ancient <i>Thapsos</i>, on the N. side of which lay the fleet of the Athenians
during their expedition against Syracuse (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>The train passes the small bay of <i>Trogilos</i>, where the fleet of Marcellus
once anchored (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>), and a tunny-fishery (tonnara), runs through
a cutting, and skirts the limestone plateau near Cape Santa Panagia. To
the left we have a fine view of the sea and the modern town, and at length
reach the (115 M.) harbour-station of <i>Syracuse</i> (p. <a href='#Page_162'>162</a>).</p>

by morning light, either by one of the steamers mentioned at
p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a> or by one of the ferry-boats (comp. p. <a href='#Page_156'>156</a>). To the left,
nearly opposite Messina, is the little town of <i>Villa San Giovanni</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>), now in ruins, as are also the villages of <i>Catona</i>, <i>Gallico</i>,
<i>Archi</i>, and others farther to the S.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Reggio</b> (Alb. Veneto-Trentino, a temporary hotel-restaurant),
before the earthquake of 1908 a town of 35,000 inhab., called
<i>Reggio Calabria</i> to distinguish it from Reggio in the Emilia, lies
at the W. base of the <i>Aspromonte</i> (p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>). The ancient <i>Rhegium</i>,
originally a Eubœan colony, but occupied by new Messenian settlers
in 723 B.C., has been destroyed eight times in war and twice by
earthquakes (1783 and 1908). Its last disaster was most appalling
in the upper quarters. Along the shore and in the piazzas the
survivors are now living in huts. The <i>Strada Reggio Campi</i>
above the town offers a beautiful view especially towards evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the <span class='sc'>Voyage to Catania</span> we enjoy a splendid view of the
whole of the straits as far as the <i>Punta del Faro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>), and later
of the coast of Calabria from the <i>Punta di Pellaro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>) to the
<i>Capo dell’ Armi</i>. On the Sicilian coast rise the <i>Monti Peloritani</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>) and the majestic <i>Mt. Ætna</i> (10,958 ft.; Ital. <i>Etna</i>), the
highest volcano in Europe, with its countless minor craters and the
great <i>Valle del Bove</i>, the remains of the enormous oldest crater,
3 M. broad, bounded by rocky slopes of 1900–3900 ft. in height.
The view is specially striking beyond <i>Taormina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>), and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>obtain also a good idea of the volume and the direction of the old
lava-streams. After sixteen years’ quiescence fresh flows of lava
were emitted in the Valle del Bove in 1908 and from the volcano’s
S. slope in 1910.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Acireale</i> (p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>) and <i>Cape Molini</i>, the N. limit of the

<p class='c009'><i>Catania</i>, a wealthy town of 162,000 inhab., the largest in
Sicily after Palermo, the seat of a university, a bishop, and a natural
science academy, has lately become the chief outlet for the
products of the island, especially those of the extremely fertile environs.
<i>Katana</i>, founded like Naxos by Eubœans, about 729 B. C.,
became famous as the home of <i>Charondas</i>, the framer of the earliest
Greek code of law (about 640). In the Athenian and Syracusan
war (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>) it formed the Athenian base of attack. Katana
was one of the first places in Sicily occupied by the Romans, and
under their sway became one of the most populous towns in the
island. In the middle ages it vied for a time with Palermo and
Messina as a favourite residence of the Aragon sovereigns. It has
repeatedly suffered severely from the eruptions of Mt. Ætna (especially
in 122 B. C. and in 1669) and from earthquakes (1169 and
1693), and the present town has been built almost entirely since 1693.</p>

(p. <a href='#Page_152'>152</a>), was one of the most famous saints of Sicily, and
whose veil is said to have diverted the lava-stream of 1669 (Pl. B,

<p class='c011'><i>San Nicolò</i> (Pl. C, D, 4), or <i>San Benedetto</i>, dating in its present

the <i>University</i>, and the <i>Prefettura</i> (Pl. E, 4).</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther to the N. is the Piazza Stesicoro; on its left side is
the church of <i>San Cárcere</i> (Pl. E, 3), with an interesting Norman
portal brought from the cathedral. Close by the N. part of a <i>Roman
Amphitheatre</i> has been laid bare (greater diameter 138, smaller
116 yds.); the unusually large arena (77 by 55 yds.) is second
only to that of the Colosseum (94 by 59 yds.).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span><span class='sc'>One Day.</span> The chief sights in the modern town are the Cathedral,
the Museum, and the Arethusa Fountain (p. <a href='#Page_164'>164</a>). The greater part of the

<p class='c009'><i>Syracuse</i>, Ital. <i>Siracusa</i>, the most populous town in Sicily in
ancient times, and indeed the most important of all the Hellenic
cities, now a mere shadow of its glorious past, with 27,000 inhab.
only, lies on an island separated from the mainland by a narrow
strait. It was founded under the name of <i>Syracusae</i> by Corinthians,
in 734 B. C., on the island then called <i>Ortygia</i>, where a Phœnician
settlement had perhaps already existed. Endless party conflicts
between the nobles and the townspeople led in 485 to the intervention
of the tyrant <i>Gelon</i> of Gela, who made Syracuse his residence.
In alliance with <i>Theron</i> of Acragas (Girgenti) he defeated
the Carthaginians at the battle of Himera in 480, the same
year in which the victory of Salamis (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>) saved the mother-country
from destruction. The Syracusans thereafter gradually
extended their sway over the greater part of Sicily till the year 415
when to their dismay the Athenians, instigated by Alcibiades, intervened
in Sicilian politics, and with the aid of the neighbouring
towns of Catana and Leontinoi (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>) proceeded to besiege the
city. In 413 the might of Athens was for ever shattered before the
walls of Syracuse, but the dread of being attacked anew by the
Carthaginians induced the Syracusans to entrust their government
to the tyrant <i>Dionysius I.</i> (406–367), next to the Persian monarchs
the most powerful prince of his age, who refortified and embellished
the city. The tyrant <i>Agathocles</i> (317–289) conducted a brilliant
expedition against Carthage, but without permanent success. The
last phase of the glory of Syracuse was witnessed in the long reign
of <i>Hiero II.</i> (275–216). As the Syracusans, after his death, allied
themselves with Hannibal, their city was besieged by <i>Marcellus</i>
in 214–212, and after its capture was sacked and destroyed. Since
then it has never again taken any part in political life, but in spite
of its downfall it is still one of the most interesting places in the
whole of Sicily, while the beauty of its environs is hardly less
fascinating than the monuments of its glorious past.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. The Modern Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>From the harbour-station (p. <a href='#Page_162'>162</a>) the broad Corso Umberto
Primo (p. <a href='#Page_165'>165</a>) crosses the strait to the island on which lies the
<span class='sc'>Modern Town</span>, whose narrow winding streets are still of mediæval
type. A pleasant walk, with a view of Mt. Ætna, is by the <i>Foro
Vittorio Emanuele Secondo</i> and <i>Passeggio Aretusa</i>, leading from
the Piazza Mazzini and the landing-place (p. <a href='#Page_162'>162</a>) along the harbour.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>In the grounds at the S. end of the promenade is a statue of the
famous mathematician <i>Archimedes</i>, who defended his native city
against Marcellus. Near it is the <i>Fontana Aretusa</i>, enclosed by
papyrus-shrubs. From this point the Via Maniace leads to the S.E.
to the <i>Castello Maniace</i>, a Hohenstaufen castle at the S. end of
the island, completed under Emp. Frederick II. in 1239, but now
modernized. To the N. of the Fontana lies the Piazza del Duomo.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Cathedral</b> is built into a Doric temple, probably of
<i>Minerva</i>, the beauty of which was extolled by Cicero in his oration
against Verres (p. <a href='#Page_157'>157</a>). It stood on a basement of three steps,
about 61 yds. long and 24 yds. broad. The ancient columns with
their entablature still project on the N. side, and in the interior
nineteen columns also are visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Archæological Museum</b>, opposite the cathedral, to the
N.W., contains valuable antiquities, mostly Sicilian, from the earliest
ages down to the Christian period. Adm. on week-days, Oct.–June
9–3, July-Sept. 8–2, 1 fr.; Sun. (not all rooms accessible)
10–2, free.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Ground Floor.</span> In Room I, Early-Christian inscriptions and the
sarcophagus of Adelfia (5th cent.) from the catacombs of San Giovanni
(p. <a href='#Page_165'>165</a>). In Rooms III-V, Greek inscriptions, sarcophagi, cinerary urns,
and architectural fragments. Room VI. Earthenware sarcophagi from Gela
(6–5th cent. B. C.), Hellenistic and Roman sculptures. Room VII. Chiefly
Greek sculptures. In Room VIII, a fine Venus Anadyomene (Hellenistic).</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Staircase</span> and <span class='sc'>First Floor</span> (Rooms XI and XVII-XIX) contain
the ancient historical collection, showing the progress of Sicilian culture
from the pre-Greek period (from the 15th cent.) down to the 5th cent. B. C.—Rooms
XII, XIII. Greek vases from Sicily and Lower Italy, archaic
bronzes and coins from ancient Sicily. Rooms XIV-XVI. Terracottas.</p>

<p class='c022'>The mediæval and modern collections of the Museum are to be transferred
to the <i>Palazzo Bellomo</i>, a building of the 15th cent., in the Via
Capodieci running to the E. from the Fontana Aretusa.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Via Cavour leads to the N. from the Piazza del Duomo
to the Via Diana, where on the left are the ruins of the so-called
<i>Temple of Diana</i> (keys at the barber’s opposite; fee 30 c.), but
now believed to have been dedicated to <i>Apollo</i>. This is one of
the most curious of Greek temples. In front stood two rows of six
columns each. The side-walls were of unusual length and were
each probably flanked by nineteen columns.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The Ancient City.</h4>

<p class='c021'>Long before the Athenian campaign (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>) <span class='sc'>Ancient Syracuse</span>
had extended her boundaries far beyond her island of <i>Ortygia</i> and
across the high plateau to the N. to the bay of Trogilos and the
present tonnara near Cape Santa Panagia (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>). The earliest
extension consisted in the <i>Achradina</i>, the smaller half of which
lay between the great harbour and the plateau, while the larger
half occupied the E. margin of the latter, and was enclosed by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>wall whose ruins still exist. Adjoining the Achradina on the W.
were the <i>Neapolis</i>, or new city, on a terrace above the great harbour,
and the quarter named <i>Tyche</i> after a temple of the goddess
of Fortune. The <i>Epipolae</i>, the fifth and highest quarter, on the W.
side of the plateau, was the chief base of the Athenian besiegers;
but it was only completed after Dionysius I. had (about 402–385)
enclosed the entire half of the plateau stretching from the Achradina
wall westwards, with a huge city-wall, and had built the
fortress of <i>Euryelus</i> at its W. end. The circumference of the city,
which however embraced a good deal of unoccupied land, was thus
no less than 17 M. Of the enclosing wall 10½ M. still exist.</p>

<p class='c011'>We begin with the <span class='sc'>Achradina</span>. The Corso Umberto Primo
(p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>), the main street of the new suburb on the mainland, leads
in 10 min. to a round piazza whence radiate the Floridia road, passing
the central station, and the Catania and Noto roads. The remains of
columns on the drilling-ground between this piazza and the small
harbour probably belonged to a superb <i>Agora</i> or market-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this point we follow the Catania road to the N., whence
an avenue soon diverges to the right to the Porto Piccolo (ferry,
see p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>), now choked with sand, and leads along the shore, below
the suburb of <i>Santa Lucia</i>, and across a railway cutting, to (25 min.)
the <i>Capuchin Monastery</i> (now a poor-house). Close by, on the
right, is the entrance to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Latomía dei Cappuccino</b> (adm. 30 c.), one of the wildest
and grandest of the old quarries of Syracuse, now clothed with rich
vegetation. It was here probably that the 7000 Athenian prisoners
of war languished in 413 B. C.</p>

<p class='c011'>Following the road to the W. we skirt the plateau and pass the
<i>Cimitero</i> to (10 min.) the road coming from the upper Achradina,
and go on by a cart-road, whence, by the <i>Latomia del Casale</i>, we
see the Catania road before us and the church of San Giovanni
below, on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>San Giovanni</i> occupies the W. part of an old Norman basilica;
steps in the N.E. corner lead to the crypt of St. Marcian (4th cent.).
A monk, who shows the church also if desired (fee ½–l fr.; ring,
on the S. side, door to the E. of the vestibule), conducts us to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Catacombs of San Giovanni</b>, which like most of the catacombs
of Syracuse and its environs, far surpass those of Rome in
extent. The main passage of this great burial-place (4–7th cent.
A. D.), 10 ft. high and 6 ft. wide, runs through the rock from W.
to E. for 116 yds., and from it diverge short lateral passages ending
in circular chambers. Of the mural decoration little is now left.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little farther to the W. we cross the Catania road to the
region of <span class='sc'>Neapolis</span>, and follow the road leading to the Greek
theatre. To the left, in 5 min., we reach the house of the custodian
(½ fr.) of the Roman—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><b>Amphitheatre</b>, constructed in the time of Augustus, 153 by
130 yds. in area. In the arena lie many blocks of the marble parapet
belonging to a restoration of the 3rd century.</p>

<p class='c011'>About 120 yds. farther to the W. is the entrance, also on the
left, to the great <i>Altar of Hiero II.</i> (30–50 c.). On this vast altar,
219 yds. long and 25 yds. broad and originally rising in two huge
steps to a height of 34½ ft., were probably sacrificed the annual
hecatombs of 450 bulls in memory of the expulsion of the tyrant
Thrasybulus (466).</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite we see the <b>Latomia del Paradiso</b>, an ancient
quarry 95–130 ft. deep, so-named from the most luxuriant vegetation
which now clothes it (entrance through the gateway on the
left). In its W. slope is the so-called <i>Ear of Dionysius</i> (entrance
below, on the left), an S-shaped cavern, 71 yds. deep, 6–12 yds.
wide, and 76 ft. high, tapering at the top, with remarkable acoustic
properties. As the tyrant is said to have had prisons where from
a certain spot he could hear every whisper, the tradition has been
arbitrarily associated with this cavern.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road next passes under the modern arches of the aqueduct
and reaches, on the right, the *<b>Greek Theatre</b> (5th cent. B. C.),
one of the largest in the Hellenic world. It is hewn in the rock,
forming more than a semicircle. Its diameter is 147 yds.; 46 tiers
of seats are still preserved; the eleven lower rows were covered
with marble. Towards sunset we have a delightful *<span class='sc'>View</span> of the
town, the Porto Grande, the headland of Plemmyrion, and the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Above the theatre is the so-called <i>Nymphaeum</i>, a grotto into
which the aqueduct (see below) was led. On its left side the <i>Via
delle Tombe</i>, hewn in the rock, ascends in a curve for 165 yds., with
many lateral cuttings and tomb-chambers of the late-Roman age.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Catania road, ¼ M. to the N. of the branch-road to the
Greek theatre, diverges to the left the <span class='sc'>New Euryelus Road</span>, 3 M. long.
It leads to the W., soon passing the <i>Casa dei Gesuiti</i>, to which walkers
may ascend direct from the Nymphæum. It runs parallel with an <i>Ancient
Aqueduct</i> (‘Acquedotto Galermi’), crosses the desolate plateau, very hot
in summer, once the site of the Greek Neapolis and of <i>Epipolae</i> (p. <a href='#Page_165'>165</a>),
and joins the old Euryelus road beyond the S. wall of Dionysius I. A
little farther, where the road diverges to the left to the village of <i>Belvedere</i>
and the <i>Posto Semafórico</i> or <i>Telégrafo</i> (617 ft.; fine view), is the
<i>Casa dei Viaggiatori</i> (rfmts.; open from 15th Jan. to 15th May). Our road
ends on the W. side of Euryelus, 130 yds. from the custodian’s house.</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<b>Euryelus</b> (adm. 50 c.), the ‘outer fort’ of the Epipolæ, built
about 400 B.C., at the junction of the N. and S. walls of Dionysius, is
one of the best-preserved of ancient Greek fortifications. The five massive
towers on the W. side, whence we survey the whole site of ancient
Syracuse and enjoy a fine view ranging from Mt. Ætna to Calabria, are
flanked with two deep moats hewn in the rock. In the first of these are
subterranean apertures for sallying purposes.</p>

<p class='c022'>We may return to Syracuse by the <span class='sc'>Old Euryelus Road</span>. On the
S. side of the plateau it joins the Floridia road, 1¼ M. from the station.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Algeria</i>, the central part of Barbary (Arab. <i>Jezirat el-Maghreb</i>) and since 1830 a French colony, covers an area of about 77,500
sq. M., or, including the S. territories (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>), about 342,500 sq.
M., and contains 5,232,000 inhab. (4½ million Mohammedans and
730,000 Europeans, mostly of French, Spanish, and Italian origin).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>It extends from <i>Oued Kiss</i>, which was substituted for the <i>Mulûya</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>) by the Morocco treaty of 1845, to <i>Cape Roux</i> (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>),
the boundary of Tunisia, and from the Mediterranean to the
<i>Highlands of Ahaggar</i> in the interior of the Sahara. The arbitrary
division of N. Algeria into the three <i>départements</i> of <i>Oran</i>, <i>Alger</i>,
and <i>Constantine</i> is a survival of the Turkish administration. The
orographical regions, sharply defined except towards the E., are
the <i>Tell Atlas</i> (p. xxx), the E. prolongation of the Rîf Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>),
the <i>Great Steppe</i>, and the <i>Sahara Atlas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Tell Atlas</span> (<i>Atlas Tellien</i>), the most important part of
this vast territory, consists of two parallel ranges of folded hills
of recent origin, which intersect a great basin stretching from the
Atlantic to the bay of Tunis. The highest points of the range next
the coast are the <i>Traras</i> (3727 ft.), the <i>Dahra</i> (5181 ft.), the <i>Atlas
of Blida</i> (5345 ft.), the <i>Jurjura Chain</i> (7572 ft.) in Great Kabylia,
and the <i>Babor Range</i> (6575 ft.) in Little Kabylia. In the interior
rise the <i>Tlemcen Group</i> (6047 ft.), the <i>Ouarsenis</i> (6512 ft.), the
<i>Jebel Dira</i> (5938 ft.), and the <i>Hodna Mts.</i> (6112 ft.), which last
form the only considerable link between the Tell and the Sahara
Atlas. The <i>Littoral</i>, 842 M. in length, with long, precipitous, and
almost inaccessible stretches, has ever been dreaded on account
of its storms; it is broken by the bays of <i>Oran</i>, <i>Arzew</i>, <i>Algiers</i>,
<i>Bougie</i>, <i>Philippeville</i>, and <i>Bona</i>, but does not possess a single good
natural harbour. Flanking the coast, in front of the Tell Atlas,
are several ranges of lower hills (<i>Sahel</i>), as the <i>Sahel of Oran</i>,
between Lourmel and the mouth of the Chélif, the <i>Sahel of Algiers</i>,
and the <i>Sahel of Collo</i>, while the <i>Edough Group</i> (3307 ft.), composed
of crystalline rock, forms an independent mountain. The
extensive plains behind the Sahels, which at Oran are marshy
(<i>Marais de la Macta</i>) and have besides the remains of great salt
lagoons (<i>Sebkha d’Oran</i> and <i>Salines d’Arzew</i>), and especially the
<i>Mitidja</i> near Algiers, once a bay of the sea, and the <i>Plaine de
Bône</i>, are the most fertile and richly cultivated parts of Algeria.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Hauts-Plateaux</span> or <i>Great Steppe</i>, an almost unwatered
region, was originally a deep depression between the Tell and the
Sahara Atlas, which in the course of thousands of years was gradually
filled up with the alluvial deposits of mountain-torrents, and
thus converted into a great and monotonous undulating plain, 2300–3300
ft. above the sea-level. The saline and gipseous soil is very
sterile and is only at a few places adapted for the culture of grain,
but has proved suitable for sheep-grazing. In the depressions of
the steppe lie a number of extensive shotts or salt-lakes, which
in summer are dry and recognizable only by their dazzling snow-white
incrustation. Among these are the <i>Chott Gharbi</i> (<i>Rharbi</i>)
and the <i>Chott ech-Chergui</i> in Oran, the <i>Zahrès Gharbi</i> and <i>Zahrès
Chergui</i> in Algiers, and the <i>Chott el-Hodna</i> at Constantine.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The <span class='sc'>Sahara Atlas</span> (<i>Atlas Saharien</i>) forms the great barrier
between Algeria and the desert. It is ‘a region of grand and wildly
fissured gorges, partly caused by erosion in the pluvial period, of
valleys worn by torrents, of lofty plains converted into mountains,
and of marine basins now filled up’ (Theob. Fischer). The chief
heights are the <i>Montagnes des Ksour</i> (7004 ft.), a prolongation of
the much higher Morocco Atlas (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>), <i>Jebel Amour</i> (6467 ft.),
the <i>Monts des Ouled-Naïl</i> (5295 ft.), and, beyond the depression
of the <i>Monts du Zab</i> (4304 ft.), the <i>Aurès Mts.</i> (7634 ft.), which
are wooded in their N. half, and next to Great Kabylia have the
finest hill-scenery in Algeria.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Sahara</span>, which belongs to the Territoires du Sud or de
Commandement, governed by the military ‘Bureaux Arabes’, consists
of the <i>Bassin du Gourara</i> or <i>Bassin de l’Oued Saoura</i> on
the W., a plateau 330–2600 ft. above the sea, and of the <i>Bassin du
Melrir</i>, named after the <i>Chott Melrir</i>, on the E., lying partly below
the sea-level. Within this desert region, which is divided by
the limestone plateau of the <i>Mzab</i>, are distinguished the <i>Hammadas</i>,
or lofty plateaux, with rocky or hard clay-soil, entirely waterless
and sterile, and the <i>Areg</i> (sing. <i>Erg</i>), the extensive sand-hills
rising a few hundred feet above the plains. From the Sahara Atlas
and from the hills of the S. Sahara descend numerous water-courses,
mostly subterranean, towards the plains, enabling the natives by
means of irrigation to form a girdle of oases, which like the coast-plains
are apt to be malarious in summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Climatically also Algeria is a land of striking contrasts. The
rainfall in the provinces of Algiers and Constantine, on the coast,
and especially in the higher parts of the Tell Atlas, is abundant
(thus at Algiers 25 inches, at Blida 37, Bougie 41½, Fort-National
45 inches). Being partly sheltered from the rainy N.W. winds by
the Tell Atlas, the <i>Hauts-Plateaux</i> have a lower rainfall (16–20
inches), which as in the Tell often takes the form of snowstorms.
In the Sahara Atlas and the Sahara itself, where the dry
trade-winds prevail during the greater part of the year, the rainfall
diminishes considerably as we go southwards (thus at Biskra 7, at
Goléa 2¾ inches). Even in the coast-lands, however, the prolonged
drought of summer necessitates the use of artificial irrigation by
means of <i>barrages</i> across the valleys. The temperature on the coast
varies comparatively little (thus at Algiers 54½° Fahr. in winter,
74° in summer), but the moisture of the air renders it almost
unbearably hot in summer. On the Hauts-Plateaux, on the other
hand, in the Sahara Atlas, and notably in the Sahara, there are
great extremes of heat and cold, the variations not only between
summer and winter, but also between day and night (in consequence
of the great evaporation after hot, cloudless days) being very marked
(thus, minimum at Constantine 16° Fahr., at Aïn-Sefra 17½° at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Géryville 8½° Touggourt 19½°; maximum at Géryville 109°,
at Biskra 118°, at Touggourt 122°).</p>

<p class='c011'>The fauna of Algeria is comparatively poor. The Barbary lion
and the ostrich have been exterminated, and the panther is now
rare; but we occasionally see camels, hyænas, jackals, maned
sheep (p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>), one species of ape (Magot, Macacus ecaudatus), a
few poisonous snakes, and the unduly dreaded scorpion. The flora
on the other hand is strikingly rich and varied. In the coast-zone
occur all the usual Mediterranean plants. In the Tell Atlas there
still exist, in spite of the wanton destruction of trees by the natives,
remains of ancient forests of cork-trees (Quercus suber), evergreen
oaks (Quercus Ilex and Quercus cenis), Aleppo pines, and occasionally
of cedars (p. <a href='#Page_210'>210</a>). In marked contrast to this vegetation is
that of the great steppes, where the saline plants, the meagre dwarf-palms
(Chamærops humilis), and particularly the alfa (halfa) or
esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), of which immense quantities
are exported chiefly from the province of Oran, proclaim the proximity
of the sterile and dreary desert. At Bou-Saâda (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>), in
the hottest S. valleys of the Sahara Atlas, and in the oases of the
Sahara we find the home of the date-palm (Phœnix dactylifera,
Arabic <i>nakhl</i>), whose fruit is the chief food of the poorer classes
and also an important article of commerce, whose sap yields palmwine,
whose trunks afford building material, and with whose leaves
are made the mats and bedding of the natives.</p>

<p class='c011'>The majority of the native inhabitants, who in the S. regions,
away from the oases, are chiefly nomadic, are <i>Berbers</i> (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>).
These, however, since the immigration of the Beni Hilal and Beni
Soleïm (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), have mingled with Arabs much more than in Morocco,
and outside of their mountain fastnesses have completely
exchanged their own individuality for that of the Arab. The town
populations, especially in the province of Algiers, are composed of
a motley assemblage of <i>Moors</i>, descended from Spanish Moriscoes
or from pirates (largely Christian apostates), of <i>Kabyles</i> (p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>),
<i>Mozabites</i> (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>), <i>Biskris</i> (p. <a href='#Page_280'>280</a>), and lastly of <i>Kuluglis</i>,
descended from Turks and Moorish women. The <i>Jews</i>, partly
settled in Barbary since ancient times, partly immigrants from
Spain, have enjoyed, unlike the Mohammedans, the full rights of
citizenship since 1870, but, though thriving materially, they are
hardly superior in culture to the less favoured inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down to the end of the middle ages Algeria was historically
inseparable from Tunisia and Morocco (see pp. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>, 187, 188, 322).
After the whole coast as far as the Atlantic had been colonized by
the Carthaginians, and the whole of S. Algeria by the Romans, but
with diminishing energy as they proceeded from E. to W., a period
of decadence set in. Troubles began with the revolt of the Circumcelliones,
and were succeeded by the party strife between Catholics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and Donatists, by the religious persecutions under the Arian Vandal
kings (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), by the misgovernment of the Byzantines (534–698),
and by the irruption of the Arabs (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>). During the Moorish
period, as Algeria only formed an independent state for a time
under the Ibadites (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) and the Hammadites (p. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>), while in
the W. regions the kingdom of Tlemcen (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>) was afterwards
founded, it proved a constant apple of discord between the powerful
dynasties of Morocco and Tunisia. The intrusion of the Spaniards
(p. <a href='#Page_178'>178</a>) next led to the intervention of the Turks and to the establishment
of a piratical state by Horuk Barbarossa (comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>).
Under the sway of France great improvements have been introduced;
many of the most fertile regions on the coast and in the Tell Atlas
have become state property and that of French companies or of
industrious colonists (mostly Spaniards, S. French, Alsatians, and
Lorrainers), and the long neglected seaports have awoke to new
life. The whole country has been opened up by a network of excellent
roads, and railways have been carried to the confines of
the Sahara. In the towns, with the exception of Tlemcen and Constantine,
most of the old Moorish and Turkish buildings have been
superseded by French. While but few specimens of Moorish architecture
have been spared by enthusiasts for improvement, there
still survive in the Hauts-Plateaux some interesting relics of Roman
buildings, recently unearthed from the oblivion of centuries, and
now carefully preserved from further destruction.</p>

<p class='c011'>For much fatigue and privation the traveller in Algeria will
be compensated by many a glimpse of picturesque Oriental manners
and costumes and by the varied scenery of the peaceful and luxuriantly
fertile plains, the wild mountains, and the stony and sandy
wastes of steppe and desert. Most striking of all are the wonderful
effects of light and shade on land, sea, and sky, under the glorious
African sunshine. Amid the manifold green hues of the rich subtropical
vegetation, enlivened by a wealth of flowers and blossom,
gleam the dazzling white Moorish country-houses and Mohammedan
shrines (kubbas or marabouts) and the red-tiled roofs of the mountain
villages and the European settlements. Travellers penetrating
from the coast to the Sahara will marvel, especially in winter, at
the extraordinary clearness of the atmosphere and the gorgeous
sunsets, such as neither Italy nor Greece can boast of, awakening
in every beholder an enthusiastic admiration for the desert.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding the considerable rainfall (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>) and the occasional
gales to which it is exposed, the town of Algiers is a favourite winter
resort. The best months for travelling on the seaboard and the Hauts-Plateaux
are April, May, and November, and for the Sahara February
and March. The favourite goals are, in the province of Oran: Oran,
Tlemcen, and Figuig; in the province of Algiers: Teniet el-Haâd, Miliana,
Hammam Rhira, Blida, Fort-National, and Michelet; and in the province of
Constantine: Bougie, the Chabet el-Akra, Constantine, Timgad, El-Kantara,
Biskra, and Tebessa.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The <span class='sc'>Railways</span>, with the exception of the Chemins de Fer Algériens
de l’Etat, belong to three private companies, the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée
Algérien, the Ouest Algérien, and the Bône-Guelma (et prolongements).
They are all single lines. The express on the chief line, that from Algiers
to Oran, travels 26¾ M. an hour only; the speed of the ordinary trains
is 12–19 M. per hour. On all the main lines dining and sleeping cars are
provided. On the branch-lines the trains often have one first-class carriage
only. For night journeys in the Hauts-Plateaux the heating by
means of foot-warmers is inadequate. In E. Algeria the traffic is sometimes
stopped for several days in winter by snow-drifts and cloud-bursts.</p>

<p class='c022'>The time-tables are to be found in the Livret A. Jourdan (Indicateur
des Chemins de Fer, de la Navigation, etc.; 50 c.), in the Livret-Chaix
(Guide pour les Chemins de Fer de l’Algérie, de la Tunisie et de la Corse;
50 c.), or in the Indicateur Officiel (Guide-poche Algérien par L. Chappuis;
60 c.). Greenwich time (ca. 59 min. behind mid-European time), which has
been recently introduced in France, is observed everywhere. Travellers
should go to the ticket-office early, as the officials have much writing to do
and their proceedings are slow. In the larger towns tickets may usually
be taken and luggage booked beforehand at the town-office of the railway
company. As in France each passenger is allowed 30 kilos (about 66 lbs.)
of luggage. Return-tickets (billets d’aller et retour) for a distance of 50 kilomètres
(31 M.) are valid for two days, for distances over 400 kilom. (248 M.)
for at least seven days. The Indicateurs above named contain further information
as to return-tickets ‘collectifs pour families’, ‘collectifs d’excursion’,
and ‘demi-places’, which last only benefit those who make a stay
of several months in the colony.</p>

<p class='c022'>As the roads are good and the trains slow, those who can bear the expense
will often find a <span class='sc'>Motor Car</span> the swiftest and pleasantest kind of
conveyance. Among fine motoring trips may specially be noted those from
Oran to Tlemcen (comp. p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>); from Algiers to Castiglione, Tipaza, Hammam
Rhira, Affreville, and Teniet el-Haâd, returning viâ Blida and Boufarik;
from Algiers to Cape Matifou, Ménerville, Tizi-Ouzou, Fort-National,
and Michelet (Tazmalt); from Bougie through the Chabet el-Akra to Kerrata,
or viâ Djidjelli and Mila to Constantine; also from Algiers or Constantine
to Biskra. The maximum speed allowed in towns and villages is
15 kilomètres (9½ M.) an hour, on highroads 30 kilom. (19 M.) per hour.
The cars offered for hire in the larger towns are generally good machines
of 15–60 horse-power.</p>

<p class='c022'>Where neither railways nor motor-omnibuses are available persons
of limited means travel by <span class='sc'>Diligence</span> (see time-tables in Jourdan’s Indicateur,
mentioned above). Besides the ‘Courrier’, or postal diligence, there
is sometimes a ‘Concurrence’, an inferior and cheaper vehicle. Careful
inquiry as to time-table and fares should be made, and front seats secured
beforehand. The officials sometimes charge strangers more than the legitimate
fare. If the passenger prefers to walk or ride part of the way,
he may arrange with the driver as to the carriage of his luggage.</p>

<p class='c022'>Off the highroads and for mountain excursions <span class='sc'>Riding</span> is often preferable
to walking. A mule (<i>mulet</i>) or a donkey (<i>bourricot</i>) is more commonly
used than a horse. The Arabian saddle with its high cantle and
pommel gives a certain sense of security to the novice, but the experienced
rider will prefer an English saddle, which may be obtained in the
larger towns. The animals are badly kept by the natives, but are quiet
and sure-footed. Instead of a saddle, mules and donkeys often have a
kind of sack thrown over their backs, into which the rider thrusts his
feet. The attendant has to provide food for himself and his beast, and
he is always expected to walk except on very long excursions.</p>

<p class='c022'>For excursions of any length in the Sahara the traveller must have
recourse to the camel, the ‘ship of the desert’. The superior trotting
camel (<i>mehara</i>) must be distinguished from the ordinary beast of burden,
which only walks about 2½ M. per hour, but has wonderful powers of
endurance, even in the most trying weather. In the case of the trotting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>camel the rider sits on a narrow saddle and crosses his feet (with shoes
removed) on the animal’s neck. On the broad pack-saddle of the camel of
burden is a seat for men, and right and left are others for ladies, for
whom a kind of litter (<i>attatouch</i>) also is provided. While the rider
mounts the kneeling animal the attendant usually puts his foot on one
of its fore-legs to prevent it from rising too suddenly, as it is very apt
to do. As the camel rises on its hind-legs first, tilting the rider forwards,
it is advisable to lean well back at first, and then forwards, and
to keep firm hold of the saddle. Practice alone will enable the rider to
get used to the peculiar gait of the animal. The rider’s head should be
well protected by a pith-helmet or other efficient covering. Luggage is
best carried in two saddle-bags (gibera) of leather or carpet, for which
the natives ask 20 fr., or even in ordinary sacks. As to provisions,
see p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>. Intending travellers are expected to present themselves at
the Bureau Arabe before starting, where they may apply for a Saharien
or Cavalier du Maghzen (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>) to accompany them. In some cases an
escort is considered indispensable.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Money</span> for a tour in Algeria had better be taken in the form
of notes of the Banque de France or the Banque de l’Algérie (for Algeria
and Tunisia only) or in gold of the Latin monetary union. Bank of
England notes and sovereigns are always readily exchanged in the larger
towns and tourist-resorts. Circular notes are less convenient, but have
the merit of being safer. Letters of credit addressed to the Compagnie
Algérienne or the Crédit Lyonnais also form a safe vehicle for large
sums, but the branch-offices sometimes require a week’s notice before
paying. The banks and public offices are mostly open at 9–11 and 2–5 only,
but the cashier’s office usually closes at 3.</p>

<p class='c022'>Comfortable first-class <span class='sc'>Hotels</span>, owned chiefly by French, Swiss, or
German proprietors, are to be found at Algiers, Oran, Hammam Rhira,
and Biskra. Those of the second class usually make a fixed charge (5 to
12 fr. per day) for room, déjeuner, and dinner. Charges vary greatly,
however, according to the season and to the traveller’s nationality. The
beds are very good as a rule, and the rooms fairly clean, but the sanitation
is often defective and the servants inefficient. Under these circumstances
the scale of gratuities is lower than in Europe.</p>

<p class='c022'>As for food, the staple of almost every repast in Algeria is mutton.
The wheaten bread is generally excellent. Among the best wines are
the white of Médéa and Mascara, the red and the white of Tlemcen and
Staouéli, and the red of Miliana, Margueritte, and Hammam Rhira. At
the <span class='sc'>Cafés</span>, which are often beset by shoe-blacks (<i>cireurs</i>; 10 c.), we may
try a cup of ‘Nossi-Bey’ (50 c.), considered a specially good coffee. A cup
of coffee or tea at the Moorish cafés costs one sou, but strangers are often
charged two (no gratuities). A few good <span class='sc'>Restaurants</span> are to be found
in the larger towns, and food also is provided by the better <i>brasseries</i>.
Tobacco and cigars are much cheaper than in France, there being no government
monopoly here, but there is a duty of 36 fr. per kilogramme (2⅕ lbs.)
on imported cigars.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Post Office</span> arrangements are the same as in France. A favourite
way of sending small parcels is by sample-post (‘échantillons sans
valeur’; 12–15 days from Algiers to England), up to 350 grammes (about
12¼ oz.). Inland postage for letters of 20 grammes (not quite ¾ oz.) or
post-cards 10 c., foreign 25 c. (for 20 gr.) or 10 c.—Senders of registered
letters and telegrams must fill up a form giving their name and address.
Postal orders and parcel-post are not recommended.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Drawing</span> or <span class='sc'>Photographing</span> in fortified places, if not expressly forbidden,
is at least inadvisable, nor should maps or plans be too closely
studied in public places. With regard to intercourse with the natives,
see p. xxv. The police arrangements are generally as good as in Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Oran</i>, Arabic <i>Warân</i>, the capital of the province of that name,
with 110,000 inhab. (29,700 being foreigners, mostly Spaniards,
16,000 Mohammedans, and 13,200 Jews), is a strongly fortified
place, the headquarters of an army corps and a torpedo-boat station,
and has been an episcopal see since 1867. Next to Algiers it is now
the greatest seaport and commercial place in Barbary. The town
lies in 35° 44′ N. lat. and 0° 58′ W. long., on a bay of the spacious
<i>Gulf of Oran</i> (p. <a href='#Page_126'>126</a>), between <i>Jebel Santon</i> (1043 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>)
on the W. and the <i>Pointe Canastel</i> (784 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) on the E. side.
At the W. end the quiet streets of the old town, overlooked by the
bare limestone rocks of the <i>Pic d’Aidour</i> or <i>Montagne de Santa
Cruz</i> (1221 ft.), ascend the ravine of the small brook <i>Raz el-Aïn</i>
or <i>Oued Rehhi</i> to the hill of the <i>Kasba</i>, the ancient Moorish castle.
The modern industrial quarters lie to the E. of the hill of <i>Château-Neuf</i>
and beyond the ravine of the <i>Aïn Rouina</i>, extending far over
the plateau of <i>Karguentah</i> (about 250–390 ft.), a tableland which
descends abruptly to the sea and slopes gradually to the S. E. down
to the plain of the <i>Daya Morselli</i> and the <i>Plaine du Figuier</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). The town is defended by several old forts of the Spanish
period and by a number of modern coast-batteries, and, like most
of the Algerian towns, is enclosed by a wall for protection against
the natives. The chief suburbs outside the gates are <i>Gambetta</i>,
<i>St. Eugène</i>, <i>Lamur</i>, and <i>Eckmühl-Noiseux</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oran is essentially a modern town, which is being extended
and embellished with feverish zeal, but notwithstanding its French
veneer it derives a certain individuality from the preponderating
Spanish element in its population. The Mohammedan element is
diminishing here even more rapidly than in Algiers. Owing to the
scantiness of the rainfall the environs and their vegetation are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>quite African in character, and the neighbouring shotts, or salt-lakes,
resemble those of the Hauts-Plateaux (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>The Gulf of Oran, where the <i>Portus Divinus</i> (Mers el-Kébir, p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>)
was the only Roman settlement, was unimportant in ancient times. Native
tradition ascribes the foundation of the town of Oran to Moorish merchants
of Andalusia in 902, but it was not till the late middle ages that the town
began to thrive. After the rise of the kingdom of Tlemcen (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>) Oran
superseded the neighbouring ports of Rachgoun (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>), Honeïn (p. <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>),
and Arzew (p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>) as the chief staple of the W. Algerian coast, its trade
being chiefly carried on by Italians.</p>

<p class='c022'>Jealous of the successes of Portugal in Morocco (p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>), and eager,
after the capture of Granada (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>), to carry their crusade against Islam
into African territory, the Spaniards sent an expedition against Melilla
(p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>) in 1496, while the all-powerful <i>Card. Ximenez</i>, archbishop of
Toledo, proceeded to attack the Ziyanides (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>). In 1505 Mers el-Kébir,
which had been twice occupied by the Portuguese in the 15th cent., was
attacked and after a brave defence captured, and in 1509, on a second
expedition, Oran fell into the hands of the cardinal. Thenceforth Oran
formed the base of the further campaigns of the Spaniards, who in their
victorious career soon captured all the important towns on the seaboard
as far as Tripoli, and penetrated inland to Tlemcen. The Spanish governors
succeeded in defending Oran against all the attacks of the barbarescos
down to 1708, when the Bey <i>Bu-Chlar’em</i> bombarded the Spanish forts
from Jebel Murjajo, captured them, and slew the entire garrison. A
Spanish army under the <i>Count of Montemar</i> gained a brilliant victory over
the Moors at Aïn et-Turk (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) and recaptured the town in 1732, but
the Spaniards soon found themselves again overmatched by their enemies.
In 1790 the town was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake, and
in 1792 the Spaniards at length withdrew their garrison.</p>

<p class='c022'>Under the bey <i>Mohammed el-Kebîr</i> the town was erected into the
capital of the province of W. Algeria; but in consequence of the earthquake,
the interminable wars, and its entire separation from the inland
regions during the centuries of the Spanish occupation, Oran had declined
so lamentably that when it was occupied by French troops in 1831 it
scarcely numbered 4000 inhabitants. Its rapid recovery since that period
has been due to its favourable situation, its proximity to the Spanish
coast and to the rich inland district of Tlemcen, and particularly to the
extension of the Algerian railway system as far as the Sahara and to
the promotion of trade with Morocco by the opening of free marts at
Lalla-Marnia (p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>), Aïn-Sefra (p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>), and Beni-Ounif de Figuig (p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. The Harbour and the Old Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The <b>Harbour</b> (Pl. B-D, 1, 2), 72 acres in area, is bounded on
the E. side by the <i>Quai Ste. Thérèse</i>, 330 yds. long, and is sheltered
on the N. by the <i>Grande Jetée</i> or <i>Jetée du Large</i>, a pier 1200 yds.
in length, with a lighthouse at the end (Phare; Pl. D, 1). The
shallow <i>Vieux Port</i> (Pl. B, C, 1, 2), now the S.W. bay of the new
harbour bounded on the N. by the Quai Bougainville, was the
harbour of the Moorish and Spanish periods. The rapid increase of
the shipping trade (now exceeding 4 million tons annually) is being
met by the construction of an outer harbour (Pl. D-G, 1, 2). The
chief imports are sugar, coffee, rice, English coal, timber, petroleum,
candles, and paper; the chief exports wine, grain, flour, fruit,
early vegetables, alfa, ‘crin végétal’ (dwarf-palm fibre), tobacco,
cattle, hides, wool, marble, and onyx.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>From the <i>Douane</i> (Pl. B, 2) the <span class='sc'>Rue d’Orléans</span> (Pl. B, C, 2; tramway
No. 1, see p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>) ascends in a curve, skirting the <i>Quartier de
la Marine</i> and the <i>Quartier de la Calère</i>, the Spanish quarters,
to the upper part of the town. Halfway up, to the right, on the
parapet of the small Place d’Orléans (Pl. B, 2) are seen the <i>Spanish
Armorial Bearings</i> (1789).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the <i>Palais Consulaire</i> (Pl. 8, C 2; Chamber of Commerce
and Commercial Court) the street reaches the two chief
squares of the old French part of the town, the <span class='sc'>Place de la République</span>,
with the <i>Fontaine Aucour</i> (Pl. C, 2; concerts, see p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>),
and the <span class='sc'>Place Kléber</span> (Pl. C, 3). Adjoining the latter is the <span class='sc'>Boulevard
Malakoff</span> (Pl. C, 3), constructed over the vaulted channel of
the Raz el-Aïn (p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>), with a fine avenue of planes.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the S.W. side of the Place Kléber, between Boul. Malakoff
and Boul. Oudinot, rises the <i>Préfecture</i> (Pl. C, 3), the seat of the
provincial government.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Boul. Oudinot leads to the <i>Magasin du Campement</i>
(Pl. C, 3; military stores; adm. by leave of the military authorities),
in the garden of which we perceive the minaret of a <i>Mosque</i>
(about 1800) dedicated to <i>Sidi el-Hawâri</i>, the chief saint of Oran.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue Larrey leads past the E. side of the military stores to
a terrace above the harbour-quarter, on which rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Church of St. Louis</i> (Pl. 12; C, 2), an unimportant edifice
of 1839, whose choir-niche is a relic of the Spanish church of the
time of the Count of Montemar (p. <a href='#Page_178'>178</a>). The <i>Wall</i> of the Rue de
Berlin (Pl. C, B, 2), which leads hence to the Porte du Santon
(p. <a href='#Page_182'>182</a>), is of Spanish origin.</p>

<p class='c011'>We return to the Boul. Oudinot and glance at the <i>Quartier de
la Kasba</i>, the oldest quarter of Oran, lying on the hill-side below
the <b>Kasba</b> (Pl. B, C, 3; adm. on application at the guard-house),
the old citadel. The old Moorish castle on this site was succeeded
in the 16th cent. by the Spanish <i>Castillo Viejo</i>, the nucleus of the
Spanish fortifications, and now occupied by French barracks. Above
the <i>Porte d’Espagne</i>, a side-entrance at the end of the narrow
Rue du Vieux-Château (Pl. C, 3), are still seen the arms of Spain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de Madrid (Pl. C, 3, 2), a side-street of the Rue Larrey
(see above), and the steps in the Rue d’Orléans near the S.W. angle
of the Place de la République lead to the small public—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Musée Demaeght</b> (Pl. 7; C, 2), Rue Montebello 9, founded
in 1886 and named after its founder. Admittance, except on great
festivals, daily 1–5, free. Catalogues of the antiquities and the
ancient coins, 1¾ fr. each. Curator, Prof. A. Mouliéras.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the vestibule are Roman mosaics from a dwelling-house at Portus
Magnus (Saint-Leu, p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>), freely restored in parts; Roman stelæ, milestones,
inscriptions, etc. from the province of Oran.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>First Floor.</span> On the left, in Room C, natural history collections,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>including specimens of marble and onyx from the province of Oran.—On
the right, in Room D, prehistoric relics from Barbary and ethnographical
collections.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Second Floor.</span> On the left, in Room E, casts from the antique;
Moorish ornaments from Toledo and Granada; and a graphic collection.—On
the right, in Room F, modern paintings.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Third Floor.</span> On the left, in Room G, natural history collections.—On
the right, in Room H, a fine collection of coins, Numidian, Mauretanian,
Roman, Byzantine, Moorish, old Spanish, etc.; in the wall-cases small
relics from Portus Magnus.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The New Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The loftily situated <span class='sc'>New Town</span> is reached from the Place Kléber
(Pl. C, 3; p. <a href='#Page_179'>179</a>) by several steep lanes in steps (Rue de Gênes,
etc.), but more easily by the Boulevard Malakoff (p. <a href='#Page_179'>179</a>) and the
Rue des Jardins (Pl. C, 3; tramway No. 1, see p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>), or by the
Rue de Turin (Pl. C, 3, 2) and Rue Philippe (tramway No. 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de Turin leads in a bend past the <i>Marché Bastrana</i>
(Pl. 5; C, 3) and the <i>Promenade de Létang</i> (p. <a href='#Page_181'>181</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue Philippe, which ascends direct, passes on the right
the elegant <b>Demeure de Hassan</b> (Pl. 2; C, 3), which, apart from
the fortifications, is the sole relic of old Oran. According to the
inscription, it was built in 1700 and restored in 1900, and is named
after one of its later owners, a tobacco-merchant who became Bey
of Oran in 1812.</p>

<p class='c011'>The adjacent <b>Grande Mosquée</b>, or <i>Mosquée du Pacha</i> (Pl. 4,
C, 3; Arabic <i>Jâma el-Pasha</i>), erected by order of the Dey of Algiers
after the withdrawal of the Spaniards in 1792, is now the
only mosque in the town used for divine service.</p>

<p class='c016'>The front building, erected in the form of a kubba, or saint’s shrine,
at the sharp bend of the Rue Philippe, dates only from the French period
(1864). The pretty Sahn, or court of the mosque, enclosed by a
pinnacled wall, is planted with palms and bananas.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the mosque itself, whose vaulting rests alternately on short pillars
and clustered columns, is the Sedda or stage, under the great central
dome, where at the Friday service the Mosammi, or leader of prayer,
repeats the words of the priest (Imâm) for the benefit of worshippers
at a distance. On the right, by the plain mihrâb or prayer-niche, is the
mimbar, the pulpit for the Friday sermon.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the back of the mosque, in the Rue de la Mosquée, rises the
octagonal <i>Minaret</i> (Sauma), the tower from which the muezzin
summons the faithful to prayer five times daily.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pretty <b>Place d’Armes</b> (Pl. C, D, 3; 233 ft.), where the
Rue des Jardins and the Rue Philippe end, is the business centre
of the town and the chief tramway station (p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>). A <i>Monument</i>
here recalls the battle near the Kubba Sidi-Brahim (p. <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the S. side of the square rises the <span class='sc'>Hôtel de Ville</span>, or <i>Mairie</i>
(Pl. C, 3), a building in the French Renaissance style, approached
by a high flight of steps. On the W. side is the <i>Grand Théâtre
Municipal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>), opened in 1908. The grounds of the <i>Cercle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Militaire</i> (Pl. C, D, 3; concerts, see p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>), on the N. side of the
square, extend to the S. bastions of the Château-Neuf (p. <a href='#Page_182'>182</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the margin of the plateau, to the S.W. of the Place d’Armes
and W. of the Rue de la Révolution, lies the poor <i>Jewish Quarter</i>,
with its dirty streets, of which the chief is the Rue d’Austerlitz
(Pl. C, 3, 4). Here an interesting fruit and vegetable market takes
place daily (Sat. excepted). The best time for a glance at the
Jewish quarter is a Saturday morning, between 8.30 and 9, when
the women in all their finery go to the synagogues (in the Rue de
Ratisbonne, etc.).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N.E. angle of the Place d’Armes begins the <span class='sc'>Boulevard
Séguin</span> (Pl. D, 3, 4), now the main street, with the chief banks,
shops, and cafés, a favourite evening resort.—In a side-street, the
Boul. du Deuxième-Zouaves, rises the new <i>Cathedral</i> (Pl. D, 3, 4),
begun in 1905 and now nearly completed. To the S. of it is the
<i>Palais de Justice</i> (Pl. D, 4) in the pleasant square named after
it (music, see p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>).—From the S. end of the Boul. Séguin the
Rue de Mostaganem and Boul. Marceau (Pl. D-F, 4, 5) lead to the
new <i>Gare Centrale</i> (Pl. E, 4; p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a>), in the modern Moorish
style (1907–9).</p>

<p class='c011'>The S. quarter of the town, between the <i>Barracks</i> (Pl. C, D,
4, 5), built in the charming neo-Moorish style, and the town-walls,
is the so-called <b>Village-Nègre</b> (Pl. C, D, 5), a growth of the
French period. It consists chiefly of small one-storied houses, occupied
by the natives, the working classes, and the poorer Mohammedans,
with the <i>Marché Arabe</i> as its nucleus. A visit may
be paid to it in the morning, or better on a Friday or Sunday afternoon.
In an open site on the E. side of this quarter, near the Rue
Dutertre (tramway No. 6, see p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>), is the picturesque <i>Marabout
Sidi el-Bachir</i> (Pl. D, 5; p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Near this is the Porte du Cimetière, leading to the <i>Jewish
Burial Ground</i> (Pl. D, 5), to the Christian <i>Cimetière Tamazhouet</i>
(Pl. E, F, 5), and to the suburb of <i>Lamur</i> occupied by natives.</p>

<p class='c011'>The E. part of the new town is intersected by the Rue d’Arzew,
passing the new <i>Gallerie Audéoud</i> with its row of shops, a little
beyond which the Boul. de Tivoli diverges to the N. (left). In an
open site at the end of this street rises the <i>Vieille Mosquée</i> (Pl.
F, 3), built at the end of the 18th cent. (now being restored), with
a minaret resembling that of the El-Hawâri mosque (p. <a href='#Page_179'>179</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief boast of Oran is the *<b>Promenade de Létang</b>
(Pl. C, D, 2), the delightful grounds, shaded with palms, which
flank the N. and W. sides of the Château-Neuf. They are reached
from the Place d’Armes, either to the N.W. by the Rue Philippe,
or to the N.E. by a road beginning between the Cercle Militaire
and the Hôtel Continental. (To the E. of this road lies the <i>Lycée</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Pl. D, 3, a road to which crosses the ravine of the <i>Aïn Rouina</i>.)
The two N.E. platforms, above the Fort Ste. Thérèse (Pl. D, 2),
command a glorious view, especially towards evening, of the bold
coast as far as the Pointe Canastel (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) and of the double-peaked
Jebel Kahar (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>). The terrace on the N.W. side, near the <i>Nouvel
Aquarium</i> (music, see p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>), affords a good view of the harbour,
of Jebel Murjajo with the Plateau du Marabout and Fort Santa Cruz
(see below), and of the bay of Mers el-Kébir (p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Château-Neuf</span> (Pl. C, D, 2; now military headquarters and
barracks) was the <i>Bordj el-Ahmar</i> (red castle) of Moorish times,
the chief fort of the town next to the Kasba, the Rosalcázar of the
Spanish period, seat of the governor, and in 1792–1831 the residence
of the Bey of the province of Oran. Admittance on application
at the guard-house. The inconsiderable buildings date partly from
the Spanish occupation; on the outer walls and the entrance gateway
are an Arabic and several Spanish inscriptions.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>c. Environs.</h4>

<p class='c021'>(1). The old <b>Fort Santa Cruz</b> (Pl. A, 2; 1221 ft.; now an
observatory), on the <i>Pic d’Aidour</i>, the E. spur of the Jebel Murjajo,
is reached by the Rue de Berlin (p. <a href='#Page_179'>179</a>) and the <i>Porte de
Santa Cruz</i> or <i>du Santon</i> (1¼ hr.). A very rough, shadeless path
ascends to it, beginning on a stony slope to the right above the
drilling-ground, crossing the road to Fort St. Grégoire, and passing
the chapel of the <i>Vierge de Santa Cruz</i> (Pl. A, 1; 1024 ft.; view).
It may be reached also by a bridle-path through the <i>Ravin des
Planteurs</i> (Pl. A, B, 2, 3), the gorge at the beginning of the Bois
des Planteurs. The fort was built in 1700, nearly destroyed by the
barbarescos in 1708 and 1792, and restored in 1856. It has always
been connected with the Château-Neuf (see above) by an underground
passage, 3 M. long. The platform commands a fine view of
Oran and the bay of Mers el-Kébir (custodian 30–50 c.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Belvédère</span> is a more interesting point. We follow the road
from the Porte du Santon (see above), passing the drilling-ground,
and crossing the (8 min.) <i>Ravin des Planteurs</i>. Now called the
Chemin des Planteurs (Pl. B, A, 3), the road ascends in windings
through the <i>Bois des Planteurs</i>, a pleasant pine-grove on the S.
slope of <i>Jebel Murjajo</i>, where jackals are sometimes seen. To the
right, halfway up, a path (finger-post) diverges to the (10 min.)
*<b>Belvédère</b> (Pl. A, 3; rfmts.), a kind of temple where we enjoy
a superb view of Oran. We may now either go on to the Plateau
du Marabout, or else return to the town by the very attractive S.
branch of the Chemin des Planteurs (Pl. A, B, 4), which descends
to the valley of <i>Raz el-Aïn</i> (p. <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>) and leads along its left bank
to the Porte du Ravin (Pl. B, C, 3).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The road to the <b>Plateau du Marabout</b> (about 1360 ft.; carr.
in about 1¾ hr., 6–8 fr., according to bargain) ascends through
the <i>Bois des Planteurs</i> (p. <a href='#Page_182'>182</a>). From the end of the road a
walk of 10 min. to the N.E. along the crest of the hill, through
meagre brushwood, and offering a glimpse of the bay of Mers el-Kébir
to the left, brings us to the <i>Marabout Sidi Abd el-Kâder
el-Djilâni</i>, the chapel of a Persian saint much revered throughout
Barbary as the founder of the Kadria brotherhood (p. <a href='#Page_361'>361</a>). From
this point, especially towards evening, we obtain a splendid *View
of Oran, of Jebel Kahar and Jebel Orouze (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) to the N.E., of
the salt-lake and the bay of Arzew (p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>). To the S. we see part
of the Sebkha d’Oran (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>), backed by Jebel Tessala (p. <a href='#Page_186'>186</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the plateau we may either descend, a few minutes’ walk
beyond the Marabout, to the left to Ste. Clotilde (see below), or we
may go straight on, across the saddle between the Jebel Murjajo
and the Pic d’Aidour, to the (40 min.) <i>Chapelle de la Vierge</i> and
the <i>Fort Santa Cruz</i> (p. <a href='#Page_182'>182</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>(2). The excursion to <span class='sc'>Mers el-Kébir</span> (motor-omnibus and carr.,
see p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>; tramway to Aïn-et-Turk projected) is specially attractive
in the morning. We leave Oran near the Douane (Pl. B, 2)
and above <i>Fort Lamoune</i> (Pl. B, 1) skirt the bold E. slope of the
<i>Pic d’Aidour</i> (p. <a href='#Page_182'>182</a>). On the wooded N. slope of the hill we
reach (2 M.) the <i>Bains de la Reine</i>, which have been in use since
the time of the Ziyanides (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), but owe their name to a visit
paid them by Juana the Insane (p. <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>). The plain bath-hotel lies
on the road above; the saline spring (130° Fahr.) and the bath-house
lie behind the rocks lower down. The baths are frequented, chiefly
in spring, both by Europeans and natives.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road next passes below (2½ M. from Oran) the villa-suburb
of <i>Ste. Clotilde</i> (197 ft.; Hôt. Ste. Clotilde), with its charming
gardens in the shade of the hill (path to the <i>Plateau du Marabout</i>,
see above). Just beyond Ste. Clotilde, in the ravine of <i>Salto del
Cavallo</i>, is the spot where Tâkhfîn ben-Ali (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>) is said to have
been slain when attempting to escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>3¾ M. <i>Roseville</i> (99 ft.; not visible from the road) has a good
bathing-beach. 4½ M. <i>St. André de Mers el-Kébir</i> (55 ft.; Hôt.
National, on the shore), a poor village, inhabited almost entirely by
Spaniards and Italians, lies at the S. base of the fortified <i>Jebel
Santon</i> (1043 ft.), the N. spur of Jebel Murjajo.</p>

<p class='c011'>The open roads of <b>Mers el-Kébir</b> (Arabic <i>Mersa el-Kebîr</i>,
the great harbour), famed in Spanish military annals as <i>Mazalquivir</i>,
now the naval harbour of Oran, are admirably sheltered
from the W. and N. winds by Jebel Santon and by a rocky headland
(lighthouse). Beyond the (5 M.) little fishing-village (Hôt. de
l’Escadre, humble) rises a huge <i>Fort</i>, the outer walls of which
date partly from the Spanish period.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span><span class='sc'>To Aïn-et-Turk and Bou-Sfer</span> (a day’s excursion from Oran; omn.
and carr., see p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>; provisions should be taken), an interesting drive,
especially in spring, affording a good idea of the progress of agriculture
in this coast-region. Beyond the headland of Mers el-Kébir the road is
carried round the <i>Jebel Santon</i>, high above the sea, by means of cuttings,
and then descends to the fertile <i>Plaine des Andalouses</i>, which is now
inhabited chiefly by S. Spanish peasants. Its name recalls the landing
here of the Moors expelled from Andalusia.</p>

<p class='c022'>9½ M. (from Oran) <i>Aïn-et-Turk</i> (65 ft.; ‘Turkish well’), a little village,
to which sea-bathers resort in summer, with a church on the hill
(177 ft.), 2½ M. to the S.E. of <i>Cape Falcon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>), from which it is
separated by a chain of sand-hills rising to a height of 397 ft.</p>

<p class='c022'>The road, now perfectly straight, ascends to the S.W., through vineyards
and corn-fields, to (13 M.) the large village of <i>Bou-Sfer</i> (486 ft.),
on the well-watered N. slope of <i>Jebel Murjajo</i>, with its thriving farms
where vegetables are largely grown. To Bou-Tlélis, see p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Bou-Sfer a road, with fine views, leads along the hill-side, and
then across the saddle (768 ft.) between Jebel Murjajo and Jebel Santon,
back to (22 M.) <i>St. André de Mers el-Kébir</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>(3). A splendid walk, especially by evening light, is offered by
the *<b>Promenade des Falaises</b> (Pl. G, H, 1), to the N.E. of
Oran. Tramway No. 3 (p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>) should be taken to the station outside
the Porte d’Arzew (Pl. F, G, 3). Here we go to the left, skirting
the town-walls, then to the N.E. across the harbour goods-line
(p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a>), through the <i>Ravin Blanc</i> at a distance from the battery
of that name, and up the fields to the (20 min.) highly picturesque
margin of the plateau, whence we survey the whole coast from Mers
el-Kébir on the W. to the Pointe de l’Aiguille and Jebel Orouze
to the N.E. A little farther on we reach an avenue of palms which
leads in a curve to the (¼ hr.) tramway-terminus in the suburb of
<i>Gambetta</i> (Pl. H, 2).</p>

<p class='c016'>Good walkers, starting very early, may extend their excursion from
the Promenade des Falaises to the <i>Pointe Canastel</i> (784 ft.), near which
ends the road coming from Gambetta (4 M.), and thence along the slope
of <i>Jebel Kahar</i> or <i>Montagne des Lions</i> (2008 ft.), in 4–4½ hrs., to the
Moorish village of <b>Kristel</b> (poor cafés), finely situated amid rich orange
groves. Or, in calm weather, we may take a sailing-boat (see p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>) from
Oran to Kristel. We may now walk or ride (donkey 2½–3 fr.) up the
steep hill to the saddle between Jebel Kahar and <i>Jebel Kristel</i> (1970 ft.);
then past the <i>Ferme Tazout</i> (1105 ft.; to the left the iron and lead
mines on <i>Jebel Borosse</i>, a spur of <i>Jebel Orouze</i>; p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>) to the S.E.,
partly through underwood, and down to the (2½ hrs.) railway-station
of <i>Saint-Cloud</i> (p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>). We may there take the train viâ <i>Damesme</i> to
<i>Arzew</i> (p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>) and return to Oran in the evening.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>From Oran to Hammam Bou-Hadjar</span>, 45 M., steam-tramway twice
daily (thrice on Sun., Mon., and Tues.) in 3¾–4¾ hrs. (fares 5 fr. 40,
3 fr. 95 c.). The line starts from the N. end of the Boul. Mascara (Pl. C, 4)
and proceeds to the S.E. viâ (4 M.) <i>La Sénia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>) to (7½ M.) <i>Valmy</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>), some distance beyond which it turns to the S.W. and runs
parallel to the S. shore of the <i>Sebkha d’Oran</i> (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). 12 M. Arbal, on
the N. spurs of <i>Jebel Tessala</i> (p. <a href='#Page_186'>186</a>); 25 M. <i>St. Maur</i>; 39 M. <i>Aïn el-Arba</i>.
45 M. <i>Hammam Bou-Hadjar</i> (574 ft.), near which are the baths

(135–167° Fahr.), resembling that of Ems, rises among the calc-sinter
terraces of the <i>Fer à Cheval</i>. A cool spring (64° Fahr.), strongly impregnated
with iron, is used for drinking.</p>

interesting; good road.</p>

<p class='c009'>Between <i>Lamur</i> (p. <a href='#Page_181'>181</a>) and <i>Victor-Hugo</i>, suburbs of Oran,
the train crosses the Damesme and Perrégaux line (R. 32). Beyond
the small salt-lake <i>Daya Morselli</i>, on the left, we enter the <i>Plaine
du Figuier</i>, on the N. side of the <i>Sebkha d’Oran</i>, one of the largest
salt-lakes in the Tell Atlas, 26 M. long and 6 M. broad.</p>

<p class='c011'>3 M. <i>La Sénia</i> (325 ft.), a Spanish village, with productive
vegetable-gardens and vineyards; also a station on the steam-tramway
from Oran to Hammam Bou-Hadjar (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>To the S.W. from La Sénia diverges the <span class='sc'>Oran and Aïn-Temouchent

12½ M. <i>Misserghin</i> (360 ft.; Hôt. des Voyageurs, Hôt. de la Paix, both
poor; pop. 4400), situated 9½ M. to the S.W. of Oran by the Tlemcen
road, a spot much visited from Oran, possessing a large pépinière or
nursery, and several monastic foundations; charming walk to the (2½ M.)
<i>Ravin de la Vierge</i> through luxuriant orange, lemon, mandarin, and
banana groves.—22½ M. <i>Bou-Tlélis</i> (295 ft.), whence a road leads viâ the

its wine.—47½ M. <b>Aïn-Temouchent</b> (847 ft.; Royal Hotel; Hôt. de
Londres; Hôt. de la Poste; pop. 7500), founded in 1851 on the site of
the Roman <i>Albulae</i>, chiefly inhabited by Spaniards, lies amidst vineyards
and orchards in the narrow valley of the <i>Oued Senane</i>, into which the
<i>Oued Temouchent</i> falls here. The Thurs. market is worth seeing.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Road to Tlemcen</span>, 41 M. (diligence at 7 p.m. in 9 hrs., returning
from Tlemcen at 9 p.m.; coupé 6 fr.) leads to the S.W. from
Aïn-Temouchent through a hill-region, composed mainly of eruptive rock,
and well-watered, to the thriving village of <i>Aïn-Kial</i> (1477 ft.; noted
for its cattle), crosses the pass (1998 ft.; fine views) of <i>Jebel Sebaa-Chioukh</i>,
and then descends past the onyx-quarries of the hill-village of
<i>Tekbalet</i> to the <i>Isser Valley</i>. 20½ M. <i>Pont-de-l’Isser</i> (807 ft.; Hôt. Pomarès,
humble), a village amid orange-gardens and olive-groves, is almost
purely Mohammedan. The road, now shadeless, affording fine glimpses
of Tlemcen, ascends for a long time in the valley of the <i>Oued el-Guettara</i>,
and reaches (37½ M.) <i>Safsaf</i> (2493 ft.) and (41 M.) <i>Tlemcen</i> (2658 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_187'>187</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Another road (23 M.; omn. at 9 a.m.) leads to the W. from Aïn-Temouchent
to the little seaport of <i>Beni-Saf</i>, the outlet for the iron-ores
of the Comp. du Mokta el-Hadid (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>). From Beni-Saf a road (omn.
at 6.45 a.m., in 9 hrs.; 5 fr.) leads viâ (5½ M.) <i>Rachgoun</i> (opposite the
island mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>) into the fertile valley of the <i>Tafna</i>, the ancient
<i>Siga</i>, and to (8¾ M.) <i>Takembrit</i>, the modern name for the ruins of
the once important Roman town of <i>Siga</i>. Then, beyond the confluence
of the Isser with the Tafna, the road reaches (27½ M.) <i>Montagnac</i>
(735 ft.) and (36 M.) <i>Hennaya</i> (1346 ft.), whence it ascends to (42½ M.)
<i>Tlemcen</i> (2658 ft.).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Tlemcen Railway</span>, beyond La Sénia, crosses the Plaine

<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>on the Sebkha d’Oran (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). 16 M. <i>Ste. Barbe-du-Tlélat</i>
(492 ft.) is noted for its table grapes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our train here diverges to the S.E. from the line to Perrégaux
and Algiers (R. 33), and follows the vine-clad valley of the <i>Oued
Tlélat</i>. Beyond (20 M.) <i>St. Lucien</i> we pass a barrage or reservoir.
26 M. <i>Les Lauriers-Roses</i> lies on the N.E. spurs of <i>Jebel
Tessala</i> (3481 ft.), the mountain which separates the great and
fertile tableland of Sidi Bel-Abbès, one of the granaries of the
province, from the basin of the Sebkha d’Oran.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train crosses the <i>Col des Ouled-Ali</i> and the <i>Oued Imbert</i>
(1578 ft.) in the fertile valley of that name, and reaches the top
of the tableland. 38½ M. <i>Les Trembles</i> (1375 ft.); the village
lies on a height to the left, between the <i>Oued Mekerra</i> (Sig, p. <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>)
and its affluent <i>Oued Sarno</i>. We then ascend the Mekerra valley
to (42½ M.) <i>Prudon</i> (1477 ft.), where many of the wine-growers
are Germans, old soldiers of the French foreign legion.</p>

<p class='c011'>48½ M. <b>Sidi Bel-Abbès</b> (1542 ft.; Hôt. d’Orient &#38; Continental;
Hôt. des Voyageurs; pop. 29,080), a prosperous agricultural
town, was founded in 1849 on the plan of a Roman camp, with
streets at right angles, and is surrounded by suburbs occupied
mainly by Spanish immigrants. This is the headquarters of the
<i>Légion Etrangère</i>, composed mainly of adventurers and deserters
from Germany and other countries, the first regiment of whom is
located here and the second at Saïda (p. <a href='#Page_201'>201</a>). The legion is for the
most part stationed on the Sahara railway (p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>), in Morocco,
or in the colonies. Great market on Thursdays. Outside the S.
gate, the Porte de Tlemcen, are pleasant public grounds (concerts).</p>

<p class='c009'>62½ M. <i>Tabia</i> (2035 ft.), the next important station, is the
junction for a line to (48 M.) <i>Crampel</i> (<i>Ras el-Ma</i>), used chiefly
for the esparto traffic (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>).</p>

forth in cascades from a ravine to join the Isser. Near this, at
<i>Sidi-Hamza</i>, are considerable onyx-quarries. The train now ascends
rapidly to (97 M.) <i>Aïn-Fezza</i> (2855 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>We next enter the upper *<i>Safsaf Valley</i>, enclosed by the high
limestone slopes of <i>Jebel Hanif</i> (3928 ft.) and <i>Jebel Chouka</i>
(3786 ft.), and in a sharp bend, passing through several tunnels,
sweep round the gorge of <i>El-Ourit</i> (p. <a href='#Page_196'>196</a>), with its waterfalls.
We skirt the foot of <i>Sidi Bou-Médine</i> (p. <a href='#Page_194'>194</a>), obtaining a beautiful

<p class='c009'><i>Tlemcen</i> (2658 ft.), the old capital of the central Maghreb
(Maghreb el-Oust), was in the middle ages, along with Fez, one of
the great trading stations between the W. Sahara and the Mediterranean,
and had a factory of the Genoese and the Venetians. It is
now, after Oran, the most important town in the province, with
37,300 inhab. (including 25,500 Mohammedans, chiefly Berbers
and Moors, and 5000 Jews); it possesses the only Medersa (p. <a href='#Page_228'>228</a>)
in the province of Oran, founded in 1904, and is the chief military
post on the W. frontier of Algeria. The town is very charmingly
situated on a flat hill at the base of a ridge crowned with the <i>Kubba
Lalla-Setti</i> (3363 ft.), a spur of the <i>Jebel Terni</i> or <i>Massif de
Tlemcen</i>. Beyond the extensive hilly region to the N., sloping
steeply down to the valleys of the Isser and the Tafna (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>), we
descry the bold mountains of the Traras group (p. <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>) and of
Jebel Sebaa-Chioukh (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). The nearer environs of the town,
on the upper margin of the plateau, are exuberantly fertile. Luxuriant
fruit-bearing hedges are interspersed with groves of gigantic
olive, carob, and pistachio trees, from whose shade peep forth
the white domes of numerous tombs of saints (p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Tlemcen still contains historic memorials of its mediæval prime
and a number of Moorish works of art, mostly of the Abdelwadite
and Merinide periods (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>). These last, like the buildings of
Fez and Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), are among the most interesting in
Barbary. Their great charm consists in the fact that their native
characteristics have been preserved in a picturesque environment
where customs and dress differ but slightly from those of the ancient
East.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Pomaria</i>, the earliest settlement in this region, was once, like Altava
(p. <a href='#Page_186'>186</a>) and Numerus Syrorum (p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>), a Roman camp for the defence
of the most important military road in Mauretania Cæsariensis (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>),
but in Roman times, notwithstanding its favourable position, it was outstripped
by Siga (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). On its site, by the time of Sidi Okba (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>),
there had already sprung up the Berber settlement of <i>Agâdir</i>, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>under Idris I. (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) in 790, became the fortified capital of the E. province
of Morocco for defence against the Kharijite kingdom in Tiaret
(p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>). For seven centuries from that time onwards it was involved
in all the party struggles for the possession of Barbary. During the
conflicts of Omaiyades (p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>) and Fatimites (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), the governors of Agâdir,
descendants of Solaïmân ben-Abdallah, brother of Idris I., maintained
their position as vassals of one or other of these dynasties, but in 973
the town was sacked by Bologgîn ez-Ziri (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) in the course of a war
against the Omaiyades.</p>

<p class='c022'>In 1081 the Almoravide Yûsuf ibn Têshufîn (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) appeared before
the gates of Agâdir, and on the site of his camp (Berber ‘tagrârt’) founded
the new town of <i>Tagrârt</i>, afterwards the <i>Telensîn</i> or <i>Tlimsân</i> of the
Moors, and united W. Algeria with Morocco. In 1145 the vicinity of
Tagrârt witnessed the decisive battle between Tâkhfîn ben-Ali (p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>)
and Abd el-Mûmen (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) which sealed the fate of the Almoravide
kingdom. Since then Tagrârt appears in history as the seat of Almohade
governors of the family of Abd el-Wâd, settled near Tlemcen, a branch
of the powerful Berber tribe of the Zenata, and also as a military camp,
while the lower classes only inhabited Agâdir.</p>

<p class='c022'>The fall of the Almohades (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) gave rise to the kingdom of Tlemcen,
which was soon extended to the W. to the Mulûya (p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>) and to the E.
to Bougie (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>). The first independent monarch was Yarmorâsen ben-Zeiyân
(1239–82), of the <i>Abdelwadites</i>, who, with the aid of Moorish
artists from Andalusia, transformed Tlemcen, his capital, into a rival of
Fez as one of the most brilliant art-centres in Barbary.</p>

<p class='c022'>Embellished in legend and in poetry, and most famous among episodes
in the annals or the Maghreb were the two sieges of Tlemcen by
the Merinides (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>). The first siege by Abû Yakûb and his grandson
Abû-Tsâbit Omar (1299–1307) commenced with the foundation of the fortified
town of <i>El-Mahalla el-Mansura</i>, which, saving the mosque, was razed
to the ground by the Abdelwadites after the withdrawal of the Moroccan
army, but was rebuilt by Abû’l-Hasen Ali (1335–7) on the occasion of
the second, and this time successful, siege of Tlemcen.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the brief sway of the <i>Merinides</i> (1337–59) Tlemcen is indebted
for almost all the important buildings outside of its walls. The chief
residence of Abû’l-Hasen Ali (d. 1348), next to Fez, was Mansura, where
he erected a new ‘palace of victory’ as his kasba; but the place was
abandoned under Abû Inân Fâres (1348–58), and from that time down to
the French period it merely served as a stone-quarry.</p>

<p class='c022'>During the brilliant reign of Abû Hammu Mûsa II. (1359–89), the
first of the <i>Ziyanides</i> (1359–1517), the younger Abdelwadite dynasty, his
court vied with that of Granada as a resort of artists, poets, and scholars;
but from that time onwards Tlemcen shared the general decadence of
Barbary. It was not only the chief scene of all the conflicts between
the Merinides and Hafsides (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), but was grievously torn by internal
dissensions also, so that it soon lost all importance. After the overthrow
of the Ziyanides by Horuk Barbarossa (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), and after a short occupation
by the Spaniards (1518), Tlemcen became a poor provincial town
in the beylic of Oran. The present town-walls (1855–6) and a whole new
quarter are creations of the French régime, under which, in 1842, Tlemcen
was incorporated with their new colony of Algeria.</p>

<p class='c022'>Comp. <i>Marçais’s</i> book on Tlemcen mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a> and <i>A. Bel’s</i>
‘Tlemcen et ses Environs’ (Oran, 1909).</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Porte de Sidi Bou-Médine (Pl. D, 2, 3), the chief gate
of the town, the Rue de Sidi Bel-Abbès leads in 2 min. to the <span class='sc'>Esplanade
du Méchouar</span> (Pl. C, 3), planted with fine plane-trees. On
the left rises the—</p>
<p class='c009'><b>Méchouar</b> (Arabic <i>meshwâr</i>, the king’s castle), the residence
of the Abdelwadites and Ziyanides, erected by Yarmorâsen about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>1255, a great quadrangular pile, forming like the Alhambra a
complete quarter of the town. The building was largely destroyed
during a revolt against Hassan, Bey of Mascara, in 1670, and in
1842 was replaced by French barracks. The only relics of the
original edifice are the <i>Castle Wall</i>, built by Abû’l-Abbâs Ahmed,
the thirteenth Ziyanide, with its modern clock-tower of 1843, and
the <i>Castle Mosque</i>, founded in 1317, which was long used as a
storehouse. The latter, having been converted into a chapel for
the military hospital, has lost its original character in the interior
(adm. on application).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the E. end of the Esplanade the Rue du Théâtre leads to
the <span class='sc'>Place des Victoires</span> (Pl. C, D, 2), planted with trees, from the
parapet of which we look down on the E. Mohammedan quarter
(p. <a href='#Page_191'>191</a>) and the hills of the Safsaf valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the N.W. is the <span class='sc'>Place de la Mairie</span> (Pl. C, 2), which,
together with the Place d’Alger (p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>) on its W. side, forms the
business centre of the town. On its S. side rises the <i>Mairie</i> (Pl. C, 2),
erected in 1843. In the court are two onyx columns from Mansura,
bearing two huge stone balls which were thrown into the town
during one of the Merinide sieges.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Great Mosque</b> (Pl. C, 2; Arabic <i>Jâma el-Kebîr</i>), the
back of which bounds the N. side of the square, now the only edifice
of the Almoravide period at Tlemcen, is very important in art-history
as one of the few Moorish buildings of the 12th cent. that
have survived without alteration. The inscription on the frieze of
the drum of the mihrâb dome records the name of the founder, the
caliph Ali ibn Yûsuf, who with the aid of Andalusian artists erected
the court and the house of prayer adjacent to the <i>Kasr el-Kadîm</i>,
or royal castle, in 1135–8. The minaret was not added till the
reign of Yarmorâsen (after 1250). The kubba at the S.W. angle,
adjoining the Rue de France, once perhaps the tomb of Yarmorâsen
and several of the Ziyanides, now contains the vault of <i>Mohammed
ben-Merzûg</i>. On the E. side of the mosque, near the old vine in the
side-street, is a second saint’s tomb, the kubba of <i>Ahmed Bel-Hasen
el-Ghomari</i> (d. 1466). The library, a later addition next
to the minaret, has been removed by the French.</p>

<p class='c011'>The square court of the mosque, which we enter on the E. side,
is flanked on three sides by triple or quadruple arcades; the two
aisles of the N. arcade, which precede the minaret, are of later
date. The irregular plan of the arcades and of the main portal
leading into the nave of the mosque was probably due to the situation
of the castle. The onyx pavement of the court is preserved
in part only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span>, consisting of a central nave (15 by 10½ ft.) with
twelve narrower aisles, is entered by five portals on the S. side of
the court, whose arches are of round or pointed horseshoe form or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>multifoil, and also by two E. portals. The arcades, whose arches are
mostly horseshoe-shaped, but in a few cases pointed, rest on short
pillars. The open roof is well preserved. The nave is crowned with
two domes, the nearer rising behind the sedda (p. <a href='#Page_180'>180</a>), while the
second, over the mihrâb chapel, shows beginnings of stalactite vaulting.
The great candelabrum under the central dome is modern and
is for the most part an imitation of the old one said to have been
presented by Yarmorâsen and now in the Museum (see below). The
mimbar and kursi (p. <a href='#Page_451'>451</a>) are of no artistic value, and the maksûra
(p. <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>) has disappeared. The elegant stucco ornamentation of the
*Mihrâb, which even extends to the exterior, where the stone
slabs are framed with multifoil arches, recalls the mosque of Cordova.
The prayer-niche is lighted by three perforated windows
of plaster. Behind the mihrâb is the sacristy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Minaret</span>, 115 ft. high, resembling the tower of Agâdir
(p. <a href='#Page_196'>196</a>), affords a beautiful view of the town and environs.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the W. side of the <span class='sc'>Place d’Alger</span> (Pl. C, 2), where the ruins
of the famous <i>Medersa Jadîda</i> or <i>Tâkhfînîya</i>, a school for the
learned erected by the Abdelwadite Abû Tâkhfîn (1322–37), existed
down to 1876, rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Sidi Bel-Hassen Mosque</b>, now the <i>Museum</i> (Pl. 2, B, C, 2;
custodian in the court of the Mairie; fee ½ fr.), erected in 1296
by the Abdelwadite Abû Saïd Otsmân. It consists of nave and two
aisles, with a low minaret. Used by the French successively as a
storehouse and a school, it was carefully restored in 1900, and is
now a perfect gem in the interior. The stucco *Decoration of the
walls, preserved in part only, with its rich and graceful arabesques
(p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>), and the geometrical ornamentation of the round-arched
plaster windows, recall the sumptuous rooms of the Alcázar at
Seville and the Alhambra of Granada. The half-dome of the
**Mihrâb, whose horseshoe mural arch rests on two small columns
of onyx, is borne by stalactite or honeycomb vaulting. The ancient
roof of cedar is well preserved in the left aisle only.</p>

<p class='c016'>Below the two friezes with Cufic inscriptions adjoining the Mihrâb
are fragments, built into the wall, of fayence tiles from the old Medersa
Tâkhfînîya and the Méchouar. The beautiful onyx basin once belonged to
the latrine-court of the Great Mosque. Along the walls are several Roman
and numerous Mohammedan tombstones, some of them belonging to kings
of Tlemcen. Near the entrance is the so-called Coudée Royale, a marble
slab from the Kessaria (comp. p. <a href='#Page_191'>191</a>), bearing an ell-measure and regulations
for the trade of Christian merchants with the natives (1328). In the
second room are the old candelabrum and remains of the old maksûra of
the Great Mosque (comp. above), Moorish and Turkish tiles, etc. On the
first floor is the <i>Geological Museum</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dirty streets to the S. of the Place de la Mairie and the
Place d’Alger, which have been laid out in straight lines under the
French régime, belong to the <i>Jewish Quarter</i>, where, however, a few
of the old one-storied houses with a kind of sunken flat, still survive.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>A pleasanter walk may be taken through the <b>Mohammedan
Quarters</b>, especially that to the E. of the Place de la Mairie,
where we may witness, especially on market-day (Mon.), the most
lively and picturesque scenes of native life. The busiest points are
the <i>Marché Couvert</i> (Pl. C, 2) in the Place du Kessaria, where the
Italian merchants had their offices in the middle ages, and also the
Rue de Mascara (Pl. C, D, 2, 1) and the Rue Kaldoun (Pl. C, D, 1).
Adjoining the Rue de Mascara, once the Sûk el-Berada’in (saddlers’
market), is an impasse called the Derb el-Msoufa, in which is situated
the little <i>Mosque of Sidi Senoussi</i> (Pl. D, 2; his tomb is
near Sidi Bou-Médine, p. <a href='#Page_194'>194</a>), with a graceful minaret inlaid with
tiles and a small house of prayer on the first floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the street between the Rue de Mascara and the Rue Kaldoun
are the so-called <span class='sc'>Bains des Teinturiers</span> (Pl. D, 1; <i>Hammâm es-Sebbâghîn</i>),
an ancient Moorish bath-house (12th cent.?), the plan
of which seems to have been an exact copy of the Roman bath.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ante-room, now much altered, was apparently the tepidarium.
Straight on we come to the apodyterium, a domed room on twelve short
mediæval columns, with a gallery running round it. To the left of this
room is the caldarium in three sections, with the heating apparatus on
the E. side. The S. side-room is the frigidarium.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the Rue Kaldoun we leave the town by the Porte
de l’Abattoir (Pl. D, 1; road to Agâdir, see p. <a href='#Page_196'>196</a>), and turn to the
left, skirting the town-walls, above the dilapidated <i>Sidi Lahsen
Mosque</i>, built by Abû’l-Abbâs Ahmed (p. <a href='#Page_189'>189</a>), which has an elegant
minaret and an interior restored in the Turkish period.</p>

<p class='c011'>On a slope near the N.E. angle of the town-walls, below the
railway, and formerly below the Bâb Sidi’l-Haloui, is the tomb of
the saint of that name (d. 1307), adjoined by the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Sidi el-Haloui Mosque</b>, a creation of the Merinide Abû
Inân Fâres (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>). The pinnacled outer gateway leads to the now
freely restored chief portal, with its fine inlaid mosaic tiles, two
friezes with inscriptions, and a projecting timber roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ground-plan of this mosque is similar to that of the slightly
earlier mosque of Sidi Bou-Médine (p. <a href='#Page_194'>194</a>). From the court, enclosed
by a single arcade, we enter the house of prayer with its nave
(11 ft. broad), double aisles (10 ft.), and transept. The square mihrâb
chapel is covered by a slightly elevated tiled roof instead of a
dome. The old timber ceiling of the interior has recently been
much restored, and remains of the superb stucco decoration have
lately been brought to light from under the whitewash. The mihrâb
has lost all its rich ornamentation save the stalactite vaulting. The
eight onyx *Columns, brought from Mansura, which support the
pointed horseshoe arches of the arcades, are remarkable for their
beautiful capitals in the Moorish style.</p>

<p class='c011'>The minaret added at the W. angle of the court, with its multifoil
arched niches in the two lower stories and reticulated work on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the upper, resembles that of the mosque of Sidi Bou-Médine. A
portal opposite with a projecting roof leads to the domed <i>Latrines</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now follow the path to the W., skirting the town-walls, and
affording fine views, to the Porte du Nord (Pl. B, 1), through which
we enter the Rue de France. From this street the Boulevard National
soon diverges to the right to the large <span class='sc'>Place Cavaignac</span> (Pl. B,
1, 2), the chief square in the uniformly built French quarter. The
font in the church of <i>St. Michel</i> (Pl. B, 2) came from the mosque
of Mansura.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the E. side of the church runs the Rue Ximénès, intersecting
the whole town. This street, or the Rue de la Victoire (Pl. C, B, 2),
which begins at the Place d’Algier, forms the chief approach to the
<i>S. W. Mohammedan Quarter</i>, which was inhabited in the Turkish
period mainly by Kuluglis (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>). At the S. end of the Rue Ximénès,
on the left, is the interesting <i>Ecole Professionnelle Indigène
de Tapis</i> (Pl. C, 4; adm. daily 8–11 and 2–5, except on Sun., Frid.,
and great festivals).</p>

<p class='c011'>The busy Rue Haëdo, prolonging the Rue de la Victoire, leads
to the S.W. to the Porte de Fez (Pl. A, 4). In the Rue Sidi-Brahim,
the first side-street on the left, is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sidi Brahim Mosque</span> (Pl. B, 3), formerly belonging to the <i>Medersa
Yakûbîya</i>. The Medersa was built in 1362 by Abû Hammu Mûsa II.
(p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), and named after his father, but the last vestiges of it were
removed in 1846. This small mosque, with nave and double aisles,
received its present decoration in the Turkish period. The mihrâb,
adorned with the Turkish crescent, has mural tiles with gold lustre
in the Gubbio style. The present pulpit, from which the Friday
prayer was recited for the Kuluglis, was executed by the Turkish
artist Mohammed Ben-Hasen Ben-Ferfara (1831–2), and the door
of the old sacristy was carved by Sâlim Bu-Jenân Ben-Ferfara.
The <i>Kubba of Sidi Brahim</i> (d. 1401), adjoining the mosque, still
contains its old geometric stucco decoration and mosaic tiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Oulâd el-Imâm Mosque</i> (Pl. B, 3), to the N. of the Rue
Haëdo, was built about 1310 by the Abdelwadite Abû Hammu I.
as a chapel for the Medersa el-Kadîma, the oldest school of the
learned at Tlemcen, but is now in a sad state of ruin. The minaret
still shows traces of fayence mosaics. The fine mihrâb was probably
redecorated under the Ziyanides.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Rue d’Hennaya, near the Fez Gate, rises the modern
<i>Medersa</i> (Pl. A, B, 3), a tasteful new-Moorish edifice (visitors
admitted).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. of the modern town-walls, between the Porte de Fez
and the Porte d’Oran, lies the <b>Grand Bassin</b> (Pl. A, 3; Arabic
<i>Sahrîj el-Kebîr</i> or <i>ben-Bedda</i>), a large reservoir, similar to the
reservoirs of Kairwan and Marakesh, constructed of concrete,
220 yds. long, 110 yds. broad, and 10 ft. deep, now used as a drill-ground.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>It is said to have been made by Abû Tâkhfîn (p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>).
According to a tradition the last of the Ziyanide dynasty were
drowned here by Horuk Barbarossa (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) in 1517.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N.W. of the French town-walls, between the Porte d’Oran
and the Porte du Nord (p. <a href='#Page_192'>192</a>), rises the *<b>Bâb el-Kermâdîn</b>
(Pl. A, 1; potters’ gate), which already existed in the time of Yarmorâsen
(p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), so named from the potsherds contained in its concrete
masonry. The gateway, with its four towers and quadrangle,
resembles the propugnaculum of late-Roman town fortifications.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Ruins of Mansura</b>, the old entrenched town of the
Merinides (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), are reached from the Porte de Fez (p. <a href='#Page_192'>192</a>) by
the road to Lalla-Marnia (p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>), to the S.W., in 20–25 min. (carr.
there and back 2½–3 fr.), The road passes (¼ hr.) the so-called
<i>Bâb el-Khemîs</i>, a brick structure of unknown use, now much restored.
A little above it are the ruins of a second building of
uncertain origin (possibly the ancient <i>Mosalla</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In 6 min. more we reach the old *<i>Town Wall</i> of Mansura,
near the former E. gate of the town, within the precincts of which,
to the left, above the road, is ensconced the modern agricultural
village of Mansura amid luxuriant vegetation. The walls, 40 ft. high,
constructed of concrete, enclose a great irregular quadrilateral
space of about 4400 yds. in length, and are still largely preserved
on the N.W. and S.W. sides. Of the towers, about 80 in number, connected
by a crenellated passage, most are rectangular in form, but
the four far-projecting corner-towers, like the eight gate-towers,
are quadrangular.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the old E. gate, above the road, are a <i>Bridge</i> and remains
of a rudely paved <i>Street</i> of the Merinide period. Of the old <i>Palace
of Victory</i>, the Kasba of Abû’l-Hasen Ali (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), once sumptuously
fitted up, there are now, on the highest ground in the town
precincts, at the S.E. angle of the present village, a few scanty relics
only, the chief of which is the inner court, resembling the
myrtle court of the Alhambra (p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Close to the old W. gate, on a plateau above the road, rises the
**<i>Mansura Tower</i> (130 ft.), the minaret of the chief mosque,
founded by Abû Yakûb (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>). The back-wall, the staircase, the
upper platform, and the muezzin’s turret have fallen in, but the
ruin, with its golden-toned masonry glowing in the sunshine, its
peaceful surroundings, and the superb view from its base, has an
indescribable charm. The ruin was restored in 1877.</p>

<p class='c016'>The portal of the minaret formed the central entrance to the court
of the mosque. Of the three concentric gateway arches the inmost horseshoe
arch, resting on two onyx columns, has been entirely renewed.
The first story here, as in no other Moorish minaret, is adorned with a
balcony, borne by corner brackets and stalactite pendentives, now without
columns. The second story, relieved by narrow window openings, has
the usual reticulated ornamentation, while the upper story is adorned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>with multifoil arched niches. Remains of the fayence mosaics are still
visible at places.</p>

<p class='c022'>The custodian, who has generally to be asked for in the village,
shows the ruins of the court and of the mosque itself, which once had
thirteen arcades.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>The hill-village of <b>Sidi Bou-Médine</b> (2841 ft.), picturesquely
situated amid olive-groves on the slopes of <i>Jebel Mefroûch</i>,
20 min. to the E. of Tlemcen, contains, like Mansura, some of the
finest existing memorials of the Merinide period. It was once named
<i>Eubbâd el-Fûki</i> (‘upper Eubbâd’), and at a very early period belonged
to a monastery, the <i>Ribât el-Eubbâd</i>, but it derives its
present name from <i>Sidi Abû-Median</i>, a scholar from Seville (about
1126–97), who was buried here by order of the Almohade Mohammed
en-Nâsir (1198–1213). Around the kubba of that great scholar and
saint, which for centuries attracted countless pilgrims, are grouped
the buildings of the Merinide sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road to Sidi Bou-Médine, only the lower half of which is
fit for driving, branches to the right from the Sidi Bel-Abbès and
Aïn-Temouchent road, 2 min. from the Porte de Sidi Bou-Médine,
and passes below the <i>Mohammedan Cemetery</i> (makbara), with its
wealth of cypresses. By the wayside are a number of saints’ tombs,
mostly in ruins, among which is the kubba of <i>Sidi Senoussi</i>
(d. 1490), with its green-tiled roof. We pass also the remains of
mosque walls and a ruined minaret, which belonged to the village
of <i>Eubbâd es-Sefli</i> (‘lower Eubbâd’) once situated here.</p>

<p class='c011'>We ascend through a defile shaded with fine old fig and cherry
trees, and soon reach the lower entrance of the village, whence we
go straight on to the mosque, with its conspicuous minaret, and
the kubba of the saint (guide quite needless). The outer gateway,
decorated anew in the later Turkish period, with its clumsy wooden
penthouse in front, is the entrance to a forecourt, within which are
the two sacred edifices and the <i>Maison de l’Oukil</i> (now the works-office),
a building of the time of Mohammed el-Kebîr (p. <a href='#Page_178'>178</a>), on
the site of the ancient Zaouïa or pilgrims’ hospice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Kubba of Sidi Bou-Médine</i>, to which steps descend to the
left under the penthouse, was restored by the Merinide Abû’l-Hasen
Ali (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), and towards the end of the 18th cent. was injured by
a fire. It owes its present decoration, save the four onyx columns
from Mansura and the sacred fountain in the vestibule, to Mohammed
el-Kebîr, whose artist, named in the inscription on the
frieze of the gateway, was El-Hâshmi ben-Sarmashîk (1793). The
vault, richly garnished with flags, ostrich-eggs, votive offerings, etc.,
contains the coffins of Sidi Abû-Median and the Tunisian saint
Sidi Abd es-Selâm side by side (custodian 20–30 c.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Mosque</b>, erected in 1339 by Abû’l-Hasen Ali, about the
same date as the myrtle-court palace of the Alhambra (comp. p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>is one of the most brilliant creations of the exuberant Moorish art
of the 14th cent.; and, thanks to the sanctity of its site, it has
survived the wars of the Ziyanide age and resisted the decadence of
the Turkish period without serious damage. The custodian is usually
to be found in the vestibule of the gateway.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<i>Chief Portal</i>, now skilfully restored, is a masterpiece
of artistic decoration. The superb outer gateway, whose lofty
horseshoe arch opens into the vestibule, is lavishly enriched with
fayence mosaics, which show beautiful arabesque patterns in the
rectangular stonework of the doorway, and geometrical designs
above the frieze with the inscriptions. The gateway is crowned by
a tiled roof resting on narrow brackets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eleven steps ascend to the vestibule, where the stucco decoration
of the upper wall-surfaces vies in beauty with the stalactites
of the dome. At the inner gateway the lower part of the doors of
cedar-wood has been skilfully encrusted anew with bronze. The
door-knockers resemble those of the present Puerta del Perdón at
Cordova (p. <a href='#Page_70'>70</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now cross the simple <i>Court of the Mosque</i>, flanked with
single arcades, to the <i>Mosque</i> itself, with its nave and double aisles.
The somewhat broader nave and the transept by the wall of the
mihrâb recall the ground-plan of Sidi Okba’s Mosque at Kairwan
(p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>). The arcades, whose horseshoe arches, like those in the
court, rest on pillars of masonry, and all the wall-surfaces are encrusted
with stucco. The richly coffered stucco ceiling of the aisles
is well preserved, but the perforated dome of the mihrâb chapel
was tastelessly restored in the later Turkish period. The *Mihrâb,
with its stalactite half-dome, its friezes with Cufic inscriptions,
and the three perforated plaster windows, deserves special attention.
The capitals of the two onyx columns which support the horseshoe
arch of the niche are the finest at Tlemcen. The pulpit is modern.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Minaret</i>, like the Kutubia at Marakesh, which it resembles
in its lowest story, still shows the three copper balls on its
muezzin-turret. The rosette ornamentation under the platform is
peculiar. The ascent is recommended for the sake of the fine survey
we obtain of the village and the beautiful view of the hilly plain
of Tlemcen with the minarets of Agâdir (p. <a href='#Page_196'>196</a>) and Mansura.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few paces above the outer gateway of the mosque court a
flight of steps on the right ascends to the old <b>Medersa</b>, now a
national school. This edifice, erected by Abû’l-Hasen Ali in 1347,
is the only learned school of the kind still preserved in Barbary,
besides that of Marakesh; but it has been almost entirely restored,
first by Mohammed el-Kebîr about 1793, and lately by the French
government. The building is usually shown by the teacher (50 c.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The portal, ornamented with fayence mosaics and surmounted by a
projecting roof like the chief door of the neighbouring mosque, opens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>into a court, adorned with a fountain and flanked with an arcade.
On each side are six cells for the students (tholba, sing. thaleb);
and there are four others in the small court adjoining the S.E. angle.
The niches in the walls for the books and lamps of the students
should be noticed. In the centre of the S. wall of the court is the
entrance to the old room for study and prayer, with a mihrâb and
a wooden dome which was probably restored in the time of Mohammed
el-Kebîr. The stucco enrichment of the walls is best preserved
on the entrance side. The old court of ablutions adjoins the
N.W. angle of the main quadrangle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The platform of the upper floor of the court, where there are
twelve more cells, affords the best view of the minaret of the mosque.</p>

<p class='c016'>At a small house near the Medersa we obtain the key (fee 30 c.) of
the so-called <i>Petit Palais d’el-Eubbâd</i>, a ruin popularly called <i>Dâr es-Soltân</i>
(palace of the sultan), situated below the Kubba of Sidi Bou-Médine.
The building, which also dates from the Merinide period, was
more probably a hospice for the richer pilgrims. It comprises three courts
with small side-rooms or alcoves, like those of the Alhambra, and remains
of baths and latrines. A visit to it hardly repays if time is limited.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the way to the ‘Dâr es-Soltân’ we pass the <i>Latrine Court</i> of the
mosque and the so-called <i>Kubba of Sidi el-Eubbâd</i>. From (2 min. farther)
the E. end of the village we may descend, and cross the railway, to
(6 min.) the Sidi Bel-Abbès road.</p>

<p class='c022'>This road leads to the E. through olive-groves, and then, turning
to the S., through the <i>Safsaf Valley</i> to (¾ hr., or from Tlemcen 1 hr.)
the gorge of *<b>El-Ourit</b> (p. <a href='#Page_186'>186</a>; carr. there and back 4–5 fr.). The bridge
across it affords a fine view of the valley and the lower waterfalls. (Rfmts.)</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>The road to Aïn-Temouchent (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>) diverges to the left from
the Sidi Bel-Abbès road, at a point 10 min. from the Porte de Sidi
Bou-Médine (p. <a href='#Page_188'>188</a>), and about ½ M. farther passes near the gorge
of the <i>Oued Metchkâna</i>, which lies a little to the left. Here, beneath
superb old terebinths (p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>), on the site of the old <i>Cemetery
of Agadîr</i> (‘Cimetière de Sidi Yacoub’), are situated the pretty
kubba of <i>Sidi Wahhâb</i>, the oldest saint of this region, said to
have been a companion of the prophet, and the so-called <i>Tombeau
de la Sultane</i>, a dilapidated octagonal domed building (12th cent.?),
which served in 1412 as a tomb for a Ziyanide princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ruins of <b>Agâdir</b> (p. <a href='#Page_187'>187</a>) may be reached in about 10 min.
from the Porte de l’Abattoir (Pl. D, 1; p. <a href='#Page_191'>191</a>) by the old Safsaf
road to the N.E. (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>). Of the chief mosque founded here by
Idris I. (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) the only relic is the elegant *<i>Minaret</i>, 105 ft. in
height, erected by Yarmorâsen at the same time as the tower of the
Great Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>). The substructures, 19 ft. high, composed
of Roman blocks of stone from the ancient Pomaria, and with Roman
inscriptions built into them outside and in the staircase, probably
belonged to an earlier minaret.—A little to the E., beyond
the ravine, are preserved a few fragments of the <i>E. Wall</i> of Agâdir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>built by the Berbers. A few paces to the N. of the road rises the
handsome <i>Kubba of Sidi’d-Dâoudi</i> (d. 1011); the present building
is probably of the Merinide period.</p>

of the campaign against Morocco, and named after the tomb of a
female saint. It is now the most important frontier-town of the
province of Oran; it was made a free mart in 1895, and holds a
great Sunday *Market, much frequented by Moroccans. Lalla-Marnia
forms the portal of the <i>Plaine des Angad</i> or <i>Plaine
d’Oudjda</i>. This great plateau is bounded on the N. by the <i>Traras
Group</i> (p. <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>) and the fertile <i>Jebel Beni Snassen</i> (4659 ft.), both
inhabited by Berber tribes only, and on the S. by the main chain of
the Tell Atlas. The old caravan route to Fez by Tâza, the key to
N. Morocco, has been the scene of all the expeditions of the Arabs
against Morocco ever since that of Sidi Okba in the 7th century.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Lalla-Marnia a new road (motor-omnibus twice daily) leads to
the S.W., crossing the frontier of Morocco halfway, to (ca. 15 M.) <b>Oudjda</b>
or <i>Ujda</i> (2241 ft.; Hôt. Figari, good, quarters should be engaged by telegraph;
pop. ca. 8000), the chief town of E. Morocco, which is said to have
been founded by the governors of Tlemcen in the 10th cent., and was
occupied by the French in 1814, 1859, and 1907. The picturesque town,
the most fertile oasis in the Angad steppe, lies amidst orchards and olive-groves,
not far from the <i>Oued Isly</i>, the battle-field of 1844 (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>). We
enter the town, passing the kubba of Oudjda, by the N. gate (Bâb el-Khemis).
Straight on is the French Consulate in a pretty garden, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to the left are the Custom House and Post Office. In the S. quarter of
the town rises the <i>Kasba</i> or <i>Dâr el-Makhzen</i>, the seat of the Moroccan
Amel or governor. At the N. angle of the Kasba is the <i>Chief Mosque</i>,
dedicated to Sidi Okba, to the N.E. of which lies the <i>Sûk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>). Behind
the mosque is the new <i>Ecole Franco-Arabe</i>. Outside the E. gate, the
Bâb Sidi Abd el-Wahhâb, is the camping-ground of the caravans; and outside
the S. gate (Bâb Oulad Amran), on a slight eminence 10 min. from
the town, are the quarters of the French troops of occupation. The Thursday
market is important. Famous horse-races in October, in connection
with those of Lalla-Marnia.</p>

<p class='c022'>For a visit to Oudjda travellers may use also the railway as far as
<i>Zoudj-el-Beghal</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>) on the Moroccan frontier, whence Oudjda
is about 8 M. distant.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Road to Nemours</span> (diligence) leads to the N. from Lalla-Marnia
through a hilly region, crosses the <i>Oued Mouïlah</i>, a tributary
of the Tafna, near the <i>Hammam Sidi-Cheikh</i>, a small bath
with saline springs (91° Fahr.), and then winds up, past the <i>Kubba
Sidi-Abdallah</i> (on the left), towards the <i>Traras Mts.</i>, which are
famed for the beauty of their outlines. In the <i>Jebel Masser</i>, near
the top of the pass, the <i>Col de Bab-Taza</i> (2664 ft.), is a cadmium
mine, worked like the neighbouring mines of <i>Jebel Maaziz</i> by a
Belgian company.—We now descend to the N.E. in many windings,
passing not far from the onyx-quarries near the <i>Kubba Sidi-Brahim</i>,
into the valley of the <i>Oued Zebaïr</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>53½ M. (from Tlemcen) <b>Nédroma</b> (1312 ft.; inn; pop. 4900),
superbly situated in a fertile basin, is an antiquated little Berber
town, with fine mediæval mosques. The *Market (Mon. and Thurs.)
is worth seeing for the sake of the picturesque costumes of the
peasants who flock to it from the mountains around. Home-industries
are much in vogue in the environs.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Jebel Fillaoussen</i> (3727 ft.), the highest of the Traras group, to
the E. of Nédroma, commands an extensive view, embracing in very
clear weather the Sierra Nevada in the far N.</p>

<p class='c009'>The road soon leaves the Oued Zebaïr and turns to the N.W.
to the lower course of the brook, which takes the name of <i>Oued
Tléta</i> farther on, and from the influx of the <i>Oued Taïma</i> to the
sea that of <i>Oued el-Mersa</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the upper valley of the Taïma, on the slope of <i>Jebel Kerkour</i>
(1884 ft.), are the <i>Kubba Sidi-Brahim</i>, where a small French force under
Col. de Montagnac was almost entirely cut to pieces in 1845, and the
<i>Kubba Sidi-Tahar</i>, where Abd el-Kâder (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) surrendered in 1847.
The former event is recalled by a monument in the <i>Vallée des Jardins</i>,
¾M. to the S. of Nemours.</p>

<p class='c009'>64 M. (from Tlemcen) <b>Nemours</b> (Hôt. de France; pop. 3900),
a pleasant little town, noted for its mild and healthy climate, was
founded in 1844 on the site of the Roman <i>Ad Fratres</i>, a name derived
from two rocks near the beach. The banana culture thrives
in the environs. On the <i>Plateau de Taount</i> (407 ft.), to the N.E.
of the town, are the ruins of <i>Djemâa el-Ghazaouât</i> (‘marauders’
community’), once a Berber village, but afterwards a notorious den
of pirates (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>).—Nemours is a steamboat station (comp. R. 18).</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>396 M. <span class='sc'>State Railway.</span> Direct communication with dining-car (déj. 3,
D. 3½ fr.) and sleeping-car (12 fr. extra) three times a week only (Tues.,
Thurs., and Sat.; returning Sun., Wed., and Frid.); express viâ (129½ M.)
<i>Saïda</i> to (305½ M.) <i>Aïn-Sefra</i> in 16 hrs.; thence by ordinary train to
<i>Beni-Ounif</i> in 5¼ hrs.; trains start from the Gare d’Arzew at Oran (p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a>).
As far as (55½ M.) <i>Perrégaux</i> we may travel by the Oran and Algiers
train on the main-line (R. 33), noting that the stations there are 550 yds.
apart (omn. 25 c.). Fares to Aïn-Sefra 39 fr. 35, 29 fr. 50 c. (sleeping-car,
1st cl. only, 12 fr. extra; 2nd cl. similar to Engl. 3rd); to Beni-Ounif
50 fr. 95, 38 fr. 20 c. (return-ticket, valid 16 days, 71 fr. 30 or 53 fr. 50 c.).—A
good supply of copper coins will be found very useful.</p>

<p class='c022'>The journey from Oran to the Sahara is most interesting, as it carries
the traveller from the seaboard through a cultivated region, across
the Tell Atlas to the Hauts-Plateaux, and then over the Sahara Atlas to
the margin of the desert. The only good intermediate resting-place is
<i>Aïn-Sefra</i>. A stay of several days at <i>Beni-Ounif</i> will be found pleasant,
especially in spring. The oasis of Tiout is now eclipsed by that of
Figuig, one of the most beautiful in the Sahara. The line goes on from
Beni-Ounif to <i>Colomb-Béchar</i>, its present terminus.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Oran</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a>. Our train crosses the Algiers main-line (R. 33),
passes the suburb of <i>Victor-Hugo</i> and the <i>Daya Morselli</i> (p. <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>),
and runs to the E. through vineyards, fields, and dwarf-palm underwood
in succession, and then past the S. base of <i>Jebel Kahar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>)
to (12½ M.) <i>Fleurus</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>17½ M. <i>St. Cloud</i> (502 ft.; hotel) lies pleasantly on the spurs
of <i>Jebel Kristel</i>, 6¼ M. to the S.E. of Kristel (p. <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>). 21 M.
<i>Renan-Kléber</i> (433 ft.). The village of <i>Kléber</i> (505 ft.; Hôt.
Voinson) lies 2 M. to the N.W., at the foot of <i>Jebel Orouze</i> (2070 ft.;
semaphore), with its large quarries of white, yellow, and red marble
(‘rosso antico’).</p>

<p class='c011'>26 M. <i>Damesme</i>, on the <i>Bay of Arzew</i>, the ancient <i>Laturus
Sinus</i>. The village lies above the station, to the S.</p>

<p class='c016'>A <span class='sc'>Branch Line</span> (3 M., in 12–15 min.) connects Damesme with <b>Arzew</b>
or <i>Arzeu</i> (7 ft.; Hôt. de la Nièvre; Hôt. des Bains; Brit. vice-consul, A.
Gautray; pop. 6000), a small seaport at the foot of <i>Jebel Sicioun</i> (532 ft.),
whence a goods-line runs to the S. to the (9 M.) salt-works on the <i>Lac
Salin d’Arzew</i>, or <i>El-Mellaha</i>. The harbour, naturally one of the best and
most sheltered in Algeria, but as yet little used, has been improved since
1906. From here chiefly alfa (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>) is exported to Great Britain and
Germany.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Damesme the train runs to the S.E., close to the shore.
28 M. <i>St. Leu</i> (177 ft.; Hôt. de l’Europe). To the S.E. of the
village of St. Leu, and 1 M. from the station, is the Berber village
of <i>Bettioua</i>, near which are the scanty ruins of <i>Portus Magnus</i>,
the only Roman settlement on the bay of Arzew.</p>

<p class='c011'>34½ M. <i>Port-aux-Poules</i> (Etablissement Thermal), with sulphur-baths,
a sea-bathing place in summer. The train skirts the
narrow strip of sand-hills and passes the mouth of the <i>Macta</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>37 M. <b>La Macta</b>, a village at the N. end of the <i>Marais de la
Macta</i>, or swamps of the river-plain of the <i>Sig</i> (p. <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>) and the
<i>Habra</i>, very malarious in summer, is connected by a branch-line
with (7½ M.) <i>La Stidia</i>, a village founded by German peasants
in 1844, and with (18½ M.) <i>Mostaganem</i> (p. <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The train now runs inland, past the E. margin of the morasses,
to (48½ M.) <i>Debrousseville</i>, in the broad <i>Plaine de l’Habra</i>. The
village belongs to the <i>Domaine de l’Habra et de la Macta</i>, the
largest estate in Algeria, watered by a network of cuttings (276 M.
in length) from the reservoir of the Oued Fergoug (see below).
Since the failure of two private companies the estate has been
owned by the Crédit Foncier de France. Of its 70,000 acres
44,000 are pasture-land, and the rest is devoted to grain and fruit.
Its headquarters are at <i>La Ferme-Blanche</i>, near the railway.</p>

<p class='c011'>At (55½ M.) <b>Perrégaux</b> we cross the Oran-Algiers line (p. <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Ascending the valley of the Habra, here called <i>Oued el-Hammam</i>
(‘bath-river’), we now penetrate the <i>Beni Chougrane Mts.</i>,
the N. marginal chain of the Tell Atlas. On the left, just before
(61½ M.) <i>Barrage</i>, lies the *<i>Barrage de Perrégaux or de l’Oued
Fergoug</i>, the largest reservoir in Algeria, which irrigates some
90,000 acres of land. The embankment, is 550 yds. long, 130 ft.
high, and from 130 ft. thick at the bottom to 12½ ft. at the top.
The reservoir once contained 33 million tons of water, but the
quantity is constantly being diminished by the deposits of the stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>67½ M. <i>Dublineau</i> (443 ft.). 78 M. <i>Bou-Hanifia</i> is the station
for the small baths of <i>Hammam Bou-Hanifia</i>, on the right bank
of the Habra, 2½ M. to the S.W. (Bath Hotel). The eight saline
springs (136° Fahr.) are the <i>Aquae Sirenses</i> of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>86 M. <i>Tizi</i> or <i>Thizi</i> (1490 ft.; Rail. Restaur.) in the <i>Plaine
d’Eghris</i>, a lofty and fertile tract between the N. lateral chain and
the main range of the Tell Atlas.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Branch Line</span> (7½ M., in ca. ½ hr.) from Tizi to <b>Mascara</b> (1903 ft.;
Hôt. Bourelly, Rue de Dalmatie, R. 2½, B. 1, déj. 2½ omn. ½ fr., quite
good; Hôt. du Luxembourg, Rue Victor-Hugo; Café de la Brasserie,
Place Gambetta; pop. 22,930), beautifully situated on a chain of hills on
the N. margin of the Eghris plain. This was the capital of the beylic
of Oran in 1701–92, and in 1832–41 was the residence and chief stronghold
of Abd el-Kâder (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>). The chief quarter of the town, with the Place
Gambetta as its centre, has a <i>Mosque</i> (18th cent.) in the Place Nationale,
and a <i>Beylic</i> (now military offices), built by Mohammed el-Kebîr (p. <a href='#Page_178'>178</a>),
in the street of that name. This quarter is separated by the ravine of
the <i>Oued Toudman</i>, now a public park, from the spacious Place de
l’Argoub (market on Thurs. and Frid.) and from the barracks quarter.
Outside the Porte d’Oran, the W. gate, we have a delightful view. Outside
the <i>Bâb-Ali</i>, the N. gate, lies the Mohammedan quarter of that
name (where burnouses are woven). Mascara is famed for its wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>At (93½ M.) <i>Thiersville</i> (1601 ft.) the train crosses a range
of hills to the stony tableland of <i>Guerdjoum</i> (much overgrown
with dwarf-palms). Beyond (102½ M.) <i>Oued-Taria</i> (1618 ft.) it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>crosses the brook of that name, the chief feeder of the Habra, and
at (110½ M.) <i>Charrier</i> (1792 ft.), in the fertile valley of the <i>Oued
Saïda</i>, reaches the main chain of the Tell Atlas. 122 M. <i>Les Eaux-Chaudes</i>,
Arabic <i>Hammâm Ouled-Khaled</i>, with saline springs
(113° Fahr.); 126½ M. <i>Nazereg</i> (2625 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>129½ M. <b>Saïda</b> (2746 ft.; Hôt. Lugan or Riu, in the market-place,
10 min. from the station, R. 2, D. 3, pens. 7, omn. ½ fr.;
Hôt. Vergnon; Hôt. de la Paix; pop. 8100), the southmost town in
the Tell Atlas of Oran, founded in 1854, lies in an uninteresting
region. In front of the Mairie rises an imposing <i>Monument</i> (1910)
to the soldiers of the Foreign Legion who fell in S. Oran. From
the Place du Marché Arabe (market on Mon.), where the <i>Mosque</i> is
situated, the Rue Thiers and the Rue Nationale lead to the S.W. to
the high-lying barracks of the <i>Foreign Legion</i> (p. <a href='#Page_186'>186</a>). Above the
market-place lies the <i>Native Quarter</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train next passes (on the left) the scanty ruins of the last
<i>Fortress</i> built by Abd el-Kâder affording a view of Saïda as we look
back, and ascends between barren hills to the tableland on the S.
margin of the Tell Atlas. 136½ M. <i>Aïn-el-Hadjar</i> (3360 ft.; ‘rock-spring’),
a village of 1500 inhab. in a fertile well-watered district,
with a military prison.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the bleak tableland, between the region of the <i>Hassasna</i>
on the N.E. and the <i>Maalif Plain</i> on the S.W., we pass several
small stations. 157 M. <i>Kralfallah</i> (3638 ft.), with great stacks
of esparto grass, was the scene of the massacre of the Spaniards at
the hands of Bou-Amama (p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>) in 1881.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train now descends to the <i>Hauts-Plateaux</i> (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), where
an occasional caravan or a few grazing camels only are seen, while
the vegetation is limited to saline plants and patches of esparto
grass (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>). 166 M. <i>El-Beïda</i> (3497 ft.), the first fortified
station. 171 M. <i>Modzbah</i> (3471 ft.), with its great stacks of esparto
grass and the goods-station of a branch-line to (22 M.) <i>Marhoum</i>,
used solely for the esparto traffic.</p>

<p class='c011'>192 M. <b>Le Kreider</b> (3241 ft.; Hôt. de Paris, R. 2, déj. 1½,
D. 2 fr.), on the N. bank of the <i>Chott ech-Chergui</i> (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>). commanded
by a small fort on the hill above it, was founded in 1881
as a military base of defence against the partisans of Bou-Amama.
The barracks, in the neo-Moorish style, are surrounded with plantations
which are watered by means of a wind-pump.</p>

<p class='c011'>We at length reach the salt-marshes, pass between low sand-hills,
and are carried through the masses of mud by means of a short
embankment to (201 M.) <i>Bou-Ktoub</i> or <i>Bou-Guetoub</i> (3264 ft.),
the starting-point of a road to <i>Géryville</i> (66 M.; diligence). We
then mount gradually to the N. spurs of the <i>Sahara Atlas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>).
Stations uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>242 M. <i>Méchéria</i> (3806 ft.; Hôt. des Voyageurs; pop. 700),
at the foot of the <i>Jebel Antar</i> range, contains barracks for convicts
of the foreign legion and a small mosque.—The train again traverses
the Hauts-Plateaux. To the left rises the distant <i>Jebel el-Malha</i>.
Near (262½ M.) <i>Naâma</i> (3825 ft.) is the salt-lake of that name,
not visible from the train.</p>

<p class='c011'>384 M. <i>Mékalis</i> (4311 ft.), the highest point on the line, with
a few fruit-trees. The train now crosses the watershed between the
Hauts-Plateaux and the Sahara, and descends into the <i>Faïdjet el-Betoum</i>,
a broad valley so named after its terebinths (Pistacia
Terebinthus L.; Arabic b’tom or betoum). The valley is flanked
on the E. by <i>Jebel Aïssa</i> (7336 ft.), and on the W. by <i>Jebel Morghad</i>
(7008 ft.), the two highest of the <i>Montagnes des Ksour</i>, as
the Sahara Atlas is usually called here. Beyond (299 M.) <i>Tirkount</i>
appear in the foreground <i>Jebel Mekter</i> (6762 ft.), with a Poste
Optique or signal-station, used at the time of the conflicts with
Bou-Amama, and the long chain of sand-hills near Aïn-Sefra.</p>

<p class='c009'>305½ M. <b>Aïn-Sefra</b> (3577 ft.; Hôt. de France or Plasse, R. 3,
déj. 3, D. 3½ fr.; 5 Hôt. des Voyageurs, both in the chief square,
very plain; Café Bienvenu), not founded until 1881, with a strong
garrison and about 1400 inhab., is grandly situated in a broad
valley between Jebel Aïssa and Jebel Mekter. The village, lying on
the left bank of the <i>Oued Aïn-Sefra</i> (‘yellow spring’), was devastated
by an inundation in 1904. A market (Mon.) is held here for
the Berbers of the environs, who still speak Tamâzirt (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>). An
iron bridge crosses to the <i>Barracks</i>, a neo-Moorish building.
Through the <i>Berber Village</i> (ksar, p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>) behind the barracks we
may climb in ¾ hr. to the top of the reddish-brown *<i>Sand Hills</i>,
formed by disintegration of the rock, which give the landscape its
very peculiar character, and whose shifting sands threaten to overwhelm
Aïn-Sefra in spite of the sheltering plantations.</p>

<p class='c016'>The famous oasis of <b>Tiout</b>, 10½ M. to the E. of Aïn-Sefra and 3 M.
to the N. of the railway-station of <i>Tiout</i> (p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>), is a favourite goal of tourists.
A horse or mule should be ordered in good time, cheapest at the ‘Subdivision’
(2 fr.; attendant 1½–2 fr.); the traveller may shorten the long ride
by returning from Tiout by train. The track leads through the broad,
shadeless valley, some way from the brook Aïn-Sefra; we have a fine
retrospect of Aïn-Sefra and its sand-hills. We pass several red-sandstone
rocks. About halfway the rail. station of Tiout and the oasis
beyond it come in sight.</p>

<p class='c022'>In this little oasis (3445 ft.), one of the highest palm-oases in the
Atlas, lies an interesting <i>Berber Village</i> (pop. 400). The low-lying gardens,
protected by high mud-walls, yield fruit and vegetables under the shade
of the well-kept date-palms. Their irrigation is provided by a small
<i>Reservoir</i> to the N. of the village, a charming spot, where we may rest
under the palms on the bank of the brook. A few minutes’ walk from
this point, to the N.E. of the village, rises a reddish rock, on which,
about 65 ft. above the valley, protected by a grating, are traced figures
of animals and hunters (archers), a prehistoric curiosity, called the <i>Hadjra
Mektouba</i>, with later Libyan-Berber and Arabic inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>About 8 M. to the W. of Aïn-Sefra, on the road to <i>Aïn-Sfissifa</i> (4176 ft.)
and the Moroccan oasis of <i>Ich</i> (3724 ft.), is the copper-mine of <i>Hasi-ben-Hedjir</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Aïn-Sefra the train (with the engine now at the other
end) follows the valley of that name and rounds the Jebel Mekter
group in a long curve to the E. Beyond (312½ M.) <i>Tiout</i> (oasis,
p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>, visible on the left) it descends to the S., lastly through masses
of débris and rock-cuttings, to (321 M.) <i>Aïn-el-Hadjadj</i>. We then
pass through a defile between Jebel Mekter and <i>Jebel Djara</i>. To
the left, framed by rocks, lies a low reddish-brown sand-hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on, to the left, between Jebel Djara and <i>Jebel BouLeghfad</i>
(5545 ft.), opens the broad mountain-valley of the <i>Rouïba</i>,
which at (328 M.) <i>Rouïba</i> joins the Aïn-Sefra to form the <i>Oued
en-Namous</i>. The train turns to the S.W., at the S. base of Jebel
Mekter, a little to the right of the palm-oasis of <i>Moghrar-Tahtâni</i>
(2710 ft.; ‘lower Moghrar’), famed for its prehistoric rock-drawings.
340 M. <i>Moghrar-Foukâni</i> (‘upper Moghrar’), beyond which
we pass its *Palm Oasis, overlooked by a kubba on a low hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next pass through the <i>Gorges de Moghrar</i>, a sandstone
ravine full of rocky débris, into <i>El-Faïdja</i>, a valley at the S. base
of the <i>Mir el-Jebel</i> (6790 ft.) and <i>Jebel Mezi</i> (6988 ft.). 359 M
<i>Djenien-bou-Resg</i> (3254 ft.) has a <i>Redoute</i>, or fortified camp (on
the left), in the style of a Roman camp, a small palm-oasis, and a
pretty military club in the Moorish style, shaded with palms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train enters the valley of the <i>Oued Dermel</i>, one of the
sources of the Oued Zousfana. In the distance we sight <i>Jebel Beni
Smir</i> and <i>Jebel el-Maïz</i> (p. <a href='#Page_204'>204</a>). An iron bridge carries the train
across the Dermel, usually dry, to the ruins of (379 M.) <i>Duveyrier</i>,
at the mouth of the <i>Oued Douis</i>, which has been deserted since an
inundation in 1904. We then descend between low ranges of hills,
<i>Jebel Tamednaïa</i> (2953 ft.) on the left, on the margin of the desert,
and <i>Djermân-Tahtâni</i> and <i>Jebel el-Haïmer</i> on the right, to the
<i>Zousfana</i> (beyond rises the old fort of <i>Campo</i>), where the palms
of Beni-Ounif become visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>396 M. <b>Beni-Ounif de Figuig</b> (2707 ft.; Hôt. du Sahara,
B. 1½, déj. 3, D. 3½, pens. 12 fr., plain but good; advisable to
secure rooms beforehand by telegraph; 1300 inhab.), founded in
1903, as being then the terminus of the railway, adjacent to a ksar,
or Berber village (<i>ât ouinîfi</i>), and a <i>Camp Militaire</i>, is now a free
mart, rapidly growing in importance. Its total trade with Morocco
and the Tuat oases amounts to about 4 million francs. The few and
quiet streets, planted with palms, present a marked contrast to those
of Biskra, which is now overrun with tourists. The white domed
building near the railway-station serves at once as a church, a
town-hall, and a law-court. Behind it is a fondouk (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The only sights are the <i>Zaouïa Sidi Slîmân ben-Bou-Smaha</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the chief sanctuary of the Ouled Sidi-Cheikh, a Berber tribe of S.
Oran, and the <i>Ksar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>), a poor village inhabited by Harrâtin
(p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>), at the back of the barracks quarter, where the mode of
irrigating a palm-oasis may be observed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beni-Ounif, situated in a rocky wilderness, commanded on the
N. and W. by jagged and fissured mountains, <i>Jebel Beni Smir</i>
(6857 ft.), <i>Jebel el-Maïz</i> (6037 ft.), and <i>Jebel Grouz</i> (5328 ft.), and
separated from Figuig by a chain of low barren hills, possesses to
the full the fascination of a Sahara landscape (p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>). The most
striking view, especially towards evening, of Beni-Ounif, the palm-oasis,
and the village of Figuig, as well as of the spurs of the
Sahara Atlas, is obtained from <i>Jebel Melias</i> (3986 ft.), a spur of
Jebel Grouz, 2 hrs. to the N. of the little town. For this ascent, and
for all the longer excursions, travellers must procure an escort
of Cavaliers du Maghzen (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>), who usually provide horses for
the journey (horse for half-a-day 2½–3, whole day 5 fr.; fee to each
‘cavalier’ 2 fr.). Application for the escort has to be made at the
Bureau Arabe (p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>) in the Camp Militaire.</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Figuig</b>, to the N. of Beni-Ounif, first visited by a European,
Gerh. Rohlfs, in 1862, is the largest and most fertile oasis in the
Sahara Atlas of Oran (containing about 400,000 date-palms).
According to the treaty of 1845 it belongs to Morocco, but only
nominally since its bombardment by French troops in 1903. From
the earliest times the oasis has been in high repute. It embraces
seven villages (ksûr), in three groups, the <i>Feghiha castra tria</i> of
antiquity. In the early 16th cent. Leo Africanus extols the artistic
skill of the inhabitants; their industries, however, are now limited
to the weaving of burnouses and carpets (similar to the knot-worked
carpets of Fez) and to the manufacture of small articles in leather.
The place is inhabited by Berbers, besides a large number of Jews,
the Harrâtin, and a few negro slaves. Tamâzirt (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>) is their chief
language, but Arabic also is spoken at places.</p>

<p class='c011'>The S. margin of the oasis, and its boundary towards Beni-Ounif,
is formed by a range of hills running from <i>Jebel Melias</i> (see above),
W. to E., to <i>Jebel el-Haïmer</i> (p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>), and crossed by four passes,
the <i>Col des Moudjâhdine</i>, the <i>Col de la Juive</i> (Arabic <i>Teniet el-Ihûdia</i>),
the <i>Col de Zenâga</i>, and the <i>Col de Taghla</i> or <i>Tarla</i>.
The shortest route is viâ the Col de Zenâga, commonly called <i>El-Kheneg</i>
(‘the pass’). By this route the whole excursion, there and
back, takes 5–6 hrs.; but, time permitting, it is preferable to go
by the Col de Taghla, watered by the Zousfana, and bounded on the
E. by the sombre rocks of <i>Jebel Sidi-Youssef</i> (3484 ft.), and to
return by the Col de Zenâga or the Col de la Juive, a full day’s
expedition. The ascent of one of the hills adjoining these passes
(stout boots advisable) in the company of an escort is to be recommended
on account of the fine view.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>The route over a stony plain to the (½ hr.) <i>Zenâga Pass</i>
crosses the <i>Oued Melias</i>, the bed of which is generally dry, near
the frontier of Morocco, indicated by heaps of stones. The vegetation
here is limited to a few thorn-bushes—jujubes (Zizyphus
vulgaris; Arabic sedra; French jujubier) and the prickly Anabasis
arietoïdes (Arabic ajerem), the ‘chou-fleur du Sahara’ of the soldiers,
which is much used in this part of the Sahara as fuel. At
the entrance to the pass, about 200 yds. in breadth, we may observe
to the left, on the stony slope of <i>Jebel Zenâga</i> (3435 ft.), several
graffiti, or rudely engraved sketches on the rock (comp. p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>),
but not very distinguishable under the black patina. Beyond the
first palms of the oasis, at the exit of the pass, rise the <i>Kubba
Sidi-Fedel</i>, surrounded with numerous votive stones (kerkours,
rĕ-yems), and the <i>Haouïta Sidi-Tifour</i>, an open walled rectangle.
We have here a good survey of the lower part of the oasis, with
the village of Zenâga (p. <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>) and numerous bordjs (round watch-towers),
backed by the Jebel Grouz range, while on the edge of the
plateau of the six upper villages gleams the conspicuous <i>Kubba
Sidi ben-Aïssa l’Aredj</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our route now leads to the N.E. across the barren, dazzling
white <i>Plaine de Bagdbâd</i> (2818 ft.). We may first visit <i>El-Hammâmin</i>,
the two E. villages, <i>Hammâm-Tahtâni</i>, on the slope of
the high plateau, and <i>Hammâm-Foukâni</i> (2950 ft.), where Bou-Amama
was encamped in 1900–2 (p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>); but it is more usual to
go direct to the four W. villages, at first through small fields of
barley and vegetable-gardens, and then between the high mud-walls
of the palm-gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>We ascend through a picturesque defile on the rocky and fissured
slope of the upper plateau, whence the water flows down in open
cuttings (see p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>) to the village of <i>El-Maïz</i>. We note here the
quaint architecture and the lanes arched over with palm-wood
beams, under which the natives take their siesta on stone benches
in the hot season. Some of the little houses of the Mellah, or
Jewish quarter, are owned by Morocco leather-workers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the contiguous village of <i>Ouled-Slîmân</i> we pass to
<span class='sc'>El-Oûdâghîr</span> (Berber <i>ât a’addi</i>), the largest village in Figuig next
to Zenâga. Since 1902 this has been the seat of a Moroccan Amel,
or governor, who with his few soldiers occupies the dilapidated
<i>Dâr el-Beïda</i> (‘white house’) on the barren <i>H’sen</i>, as the upper
plateau is called (2940–3000 ft.). The mud-built houses of the
village, mostly consisting of two or more stories, are overlooked by
the new square minaret of the <i>Chief Mosque</i>, where the governor
attends the Friday prayers. A second mosque has a very old and
graceful octagonal minaret. The <i>Prison</i> (visitors admitted), the
tents of the Amouriât, the girls of the nomad tribe of the Amour,
whose habits resemble those of the Ouled Naïl (p. <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>), and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Mellah, where the escort prepare tea in their own peculiar manner,
also may be visited with interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. of El-Oûdâghîr is the basin of the <i>Aïn-Tzadert</i>, a
spring which supplies Zenâga also and has often given rise to bitter
quarrels between the two villages. From the massive <i>Bordj</i> belonging
to the villagers of El-Oûdâghîr, adjoining the basin, we
obtain a splendid *Panorama of the oasis and the girdle of mountains
around it. At our feet lies <i>El-Abîd</i> (<i>ât enneï</i>), with its many
towers, the westmost village, now dilapidated and partly deserted.</p>

<p class='c011'>On our way back, passing the underground <i>Aïn-Meslout</i>, with
two vaulted baths (hammâm), we come suddenly to the precipitous
brink of the plateau (here about 100 ft. high), where we enjoy a
beautiful view of the forest of palms around Zenâga.</p>

<p class='c011'>The village of <span class='sc'>Zenâga</span> (Berber <i>iznâïn</i>), 1¼ M. to the S. of El-Oûdâghîr,
and 4¼ M. to the N. of Beni-Ounif, with its one-storied
mud-built houses, its massive towers, its mellah, and many vaulted
lanes, has for its centre the chief mosque and the square in front
of it. A smaller mosque lies outside the village. The large basin
is fed by underground conduits (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>) from the Aïn-Tzadert.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to the Cedar Forest of Teniet el-Haâd</span> takes a
day-and-a-half (motor-omnibus, 5 or 6 fr., in ca. 3 hrs.; diligence, leaving
at 11 a.m., returning at 9.40 a.m., in 8 hrs.; carriage 50 fr. or more,
hardly recommended). To the E. of Affreville, beyond the market (Thurs.)
and the <i>Oued Souffay</i>, our rather featureless road diverges to the S.
from the Dolfusville road; it leads among eucalyptus trees to the (2¾ M.)
Chélif, and then, beyond (7½ M.) <i>Le Puits</i> (971 ft.), ascends by the <i>Oued

of caravan-routes to Tiaret (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>) and to Chellala and Laghouat
(p. <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>), situated on one of the most important passes of the Tell Atlas,
owes its name (‘Sunday Pass’) to its Sunday market, attended chiefly by
the inhabitants of the Plateaux du Sersou (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>). On the E. side of
the little town lies the poor ‘Village-Nègre’ (comp. p. <a href='#Page_181'>181</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<i>Cedar Forest of Teniet el-Haâd</i>, on the slopes of <i>Jebel el-Meddad</i>
(5863 ft.; ‘cedar-mountain’), to the W. of the town, is still the finest in
Algeria, although largely cut down of late and bereft of its primæval
character. The Atlas cedar (Cedrus Atlantica Manetti), with its silvery
and very short needles, and of gnarled and often fan-like growth, is
smaller and less showy than the Himalaya cedar (Cedrus Deodora Roxburg)
and the cedar of Lebanon (Cedrus Libani), but in a few cases
attains a circumference of 30 ft. The cedars are mingled, particularly
in the lower parts of the forest, with evergreen or holm oaks and cork-trees
(Quercus ilex, cenis, and suber). The excursion to the forest, as
far as the Rond-Point and back, takes 4½–5 hrs., or including Kef Siga
6–7 hrs. (Mule, obtained from the natives, or horse, from the Bureau des
Messageries, 5 fr.; carr. from the latter, 20–25 fr., hardly advisable as the
road is bad.) The road to the (8¾ M.) Rond-Point leaves the highroad
to the S. of the town, but riders and walkers take a short-cut from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>W. side of the town, thus saving about 1¼ M. In about 40 min. we
come to the <i>Parapluie</i>, on the right side of the carriage-road, an umbrella-shaped
cedar on a rocky height on the N. slope of the <i>Kef Sachi</i>
(5134 ft.), and in 25 min. more to the forester’s hut (gourbi forestier) of
<i>Pré-Maigrat</i>. The finest parts of the forest are near the forester’s house
at the <i>Rond-Point des Cèdres</i> (4889 ft.; rfmts. if required), on the N.
margin of the Jebel el-Meddad, where the <i>Sultane</i>, one of the grandest
of the cedars is pointed out. From the Rond-Point a steep zigzag path
ascends to a saddle with a pasture in a clearing (on the right), where
we dismount, and whence we climb over the rocks to the top of the
<i>Kef Siga</i> (5624 ft.), the N.W. peak of the ‘cedar-mountain’. The *View
embraces the whole of the Ouarsenis group (p. <a href='#Page_209'>209</a>); to the E. rise the
mountains of Boghar; to the N. the Zaccar range with Miliana. To the
S. we survey the Hauts-Plateaux, with the bare hills of Chellala, as far
as the distant Jebel Amour (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>) in the Sahara Atlas.</p>

fertile valley of the <i>Oued Souffay</i>, between the Zaccar range
and <i>Jebel Gontas</i> (2858 ft.), to (193½ M.) <i>Miliana-Margueritte</i> or

to the left, a few minutes to the N.E. of the Porte du Zaccar, from the
Adélia road, and soon passes close below the iron and copper mines
of the <i>Société des Mines du Zaccar</i>, which are connected by a line of
rails with the road tramway. Farther on, ascending gradually through
orchards, a perfect sea of blossom in spring, we reach the gorge of the

<p class='c009'><i>Blida</i> (886 ft.; pop. 18,400, incl. 10,700 Mohammedans), one
of the pleasantest provincial towns in Algeria, with a strong garrison,
is charmingly situated at the N. base of the Tell Atlas, on
the right bank of the <i>Oued el-Kébir</i>. To this so-called ‘great river’,
as well as to the considerable rainfall in winter, the town is indebted
for the splendid timber in its public grounds and the luxuriant
vegetation of its orchards, notably the orange-groves between the
N. suburbs of <i>Joinville</i> and <i>Montpensier</i>. The town is said to
have been founded by Andalusian Moors in 1535; in 1825 it was
destroyed by an earthquake; it has been rebuilt since 1838, but in
1867 was again much damaged by an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>From the station we proceed viâ the Avenue de la Gare to the

also Boulevard Trumelet, to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Place d’Armes</span> (Pl. C, 3), which, with the adjoining Rue d’Alger
(Pl. C, 3, 2), is the centre of traffic. This pleasant square is planted
with plane-trees and has a fountain in the centre shaded by a great
date-palm (a band plays here in winter). Adjacent is the Place
Lavigerie with the Catholic church of <i>St. Charles</i> (Pl. C, 4).</p>

<p class='c011'>The streets to the N. of the Place d’Armes, with the two small
<i>Mosques</i> (Pl. 3 &#38; 4; C, 3, 2), and the lanes near the Place du
Marché-Indigène (Pl. C, D, 3; interesting Friday market) are inhabited
mainly by Mohammedans and Jews. From the Place d’Alger,
at the end of the Rue d’Alger, the Rue Zaouïa leads to the left
to the large <i>Stud Farm</i> (Dépôt de Remonte; Pl. C, 1), where fine
horses of the Arab and Barb breeds may be seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Place d’Armes the Rue and Porte Bizot lead to the
S.W. to the *<i>Jardin Bizot</i> (Pl. B, 4), containing fine araucarias,
palms, and magnolias. On the N. side of the Avenue du Champ-de-Manœuvres,
5 min. to the W. of the Porte Bizot, lies the famous
<i>Bois Sacré</i> (Pl. A, 3, 4), where two picturesque tombs of saints are
shaded by superb groups of Aleppo pines, araucarias, and olive-trees.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Avenue du Champ-de-Manœuvres joins, near the drill-ground,
the highroad to Boukirka (and Affreville; comp. p. <a href='#Page_212'>212</a>), from which, just

(p. <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>) is uninteresting and in summer extremely dusty (cabs, see p. <a href='#Page_213'>213</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>From Porte Bizot we may turn to the E. and walk round the
town-walls through an avenue of carob-trees to the Bab el-Rabah
(Pl. D, 4), the S.E. town-gate, which is reached also from the Place
d’Armes by the busy Rue Tirman. To the S. of this gate the
Avenue des Moulins, a broad avenue of planes, leads along a conduit
with several mills into the pretty valley of the <i>Oued el-Kébir</i>.
After 10 min. we diverge to the right by a shadeless road, passing
pleasant orange-groves and crossing the stream twice, and then,
just beyond (½ hr.) a mill, ascend a path to the left to the poor
village of <i>Sid-el-Kébir</i>. Above the village are the <i>Zaouïa</i> and the
picturesque <i>Cemetery of Sid-el-Kébir</i>, with the tombs of Ahmed
el-Kebîr (d. 1560), the founder of Blida, and his two sons, to which
on great Mohammedan festivals pilgrims flock from far and near.
A second footpath to the N. descends hence into the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>The highest mountains of Blida, the <i>Jebel Mouzaïa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_213'>213</a>) and
the *<i>Pic des Beni-Salah</i> or <i>Jebel Sidi Abd el-Kâder</i> (5345 ft.),
are famed for their cedar-forests, where the natives, however, have
made sad havoc, and for the grand panorama they command. The
distant view embraces the Tell Atlas from the Ouarsenis (p. <a href='#Page_209'>209</a>)
to Jebel Dira (p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>), the Dahra (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>), and the whole of the

less repaying is the ascent of the <i>Kef Chrea</i> (5085 ft.), to
the S.E. of Blida, to which a bridle-path (mule 4–5 fr.) leads from
the Avenue des Moulins (p. <a href='#Page_214'>214</a>), viâ the village of <i>Les Glacières</i>

defile, flanked with the slopes of the Pic des Beni-Salah and Jebel Mouzaïa,
here over 3000 ft. high. At (7½ M.) <i>Sidi-Madani</i> (597 ft.) begins
the finest part of the ravine; the grandest scenery is around the <i>Hôt.
du Ruisseau-des-Singes</i> (738 ft.; déj. 1¾–3, D. 3 fr.), at the mouth of the
side-valley of the <i>Oued Tamesguida</i>, and at the waterfalls beyond the
inn. The numerous apes (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>) that dwell in the rocks here sometimes
descend to the bottom of the valley.—12 M. <i>Camp-des-Chênes</i> (1253 ft.;
inn), beyond the lateral valley of the <i>Oued Merdja</i>. Following the
valley of the <i>Oued Mouzaïa</i> the train leads round the S. slope of Jebel
Mouzaïa to (19½ M.) <i>Mouzaïa-les-Mines</i> (1640 ft.), with its deserted copper
and iron mines, and then, in numerous windings, ascends the W. slope
of <i>Jebel Nador</i> (3675 ft.; fine views) to (28 M.) <i>Lodi</i> (3042 ft.).—31 M.
<b>Médéa</b> (3019 ft.; Hôt. d’Orient; Hôt. du Commerce; pop. 3800, incl.
1900 Mohammedans and 1200 Jews), a small town, perhaps on the site
of the Roman <i>Lambdia</i> (<i>Tirinadis?</i>), was founded by Bologgîn ez-Ziri
(comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), and was the capital of a beylic in the Turkish period under
the name of <i>Titteri</i>. Great native markets (Thurs. and Frid.). The environs
yield excellent white wine, but it is often adulterated.—The train
next ascends to the S.E., in numerous windings, to (44½ M.) <i>Ben-Chicao</i>
(3790 ft.), the highest station on the line.—52½ M. <i>Berrouaghia</i> (2953 ft.;
Hôt. de France; Hôt. des Voyageurs), a small town of 2300 inhab., is the
present terminus of the line, which is being continued to Djelfa.</p>

<p class='c022'>A diligence runs daily in 5½ hrs. (at 1 p.m., returning at 9.35 a.m.)
to (27½ M.) <b>Boghari</b> (2077 ft.; Hôt. Célestin, R. 2, déj. or D. 2½ fr.),
a small trading town of some importance on the upper <i>Chélif</i> (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>),
with a Monday market and a picturesque Ksar on a hill (evening dances
by girls of the Ouled Naïl tribe; see below).</p>

<p class='c022'>Boghari is the starting-point of the important caravan-route to the
Sahara oases of <i>Laghouat</i> and <i>Ghardaïa</i>. Diligence every other day at
3 a.m. vîa Aïn-Oussara and Djelfa (night-station) to Laghouat in 58 hrs.
(also motor-omnibus sometimes); most of the stopping-places have
very fair inns or caravanserais (R. usually 2, déj. or D. 2½ fr.). 13 M.
<i>Boughzoul</i> or <i>Bou-Guezoul</i> (2100 ft.); 32½ M. <b>Aïn-Oussara</b> (2330 ft.);
57 M. <i>Guelt es-Stel</i> (all three in the Hauts-Plateaux, p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>); 85 M. <i>Zmila</i>
(good drinking-water); 96 M. <b>Djelfa</b> (3803 ft.; Hôt. de France, quite
good; Hôt. du Roulage; pop. 2200), in the midst of the Sahara Atlas.
This little town, situated in the valley of the <i>Oued Djelfa</i> or <i>Melah</i>,
where dolmens abound, and at the junction of our road with the caravan-route
to Bou-Saâda (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>), is the capital of the nomad tribe of the <i>Ouled
Naïl</i>, whose daughters usually lead an evil life in the S. Algerian towns
before marriage. (Their valuable trinkets are noticeable.) 118 M. <i>Aïn-el-Ibel</i>
(3412 ft.); 137 M. <i>Sidi-Maklouf</i> (3019 ft.).—177½ M. <b>Laghouat</b>
(2461 ft.; Hôt. Storace, good; Hôt. Mendane; pop. 5700, incl 5000 Mohammedans
and 400 Jews). This picturesque little town, on the S. slope of
the Sahara Atlas, with its military headquarters and brisk trade, lies on
the <i>Oued Mzi</i> (called Oued Djedi lower down; p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>), amidst the fruit-trees
of a palm-oasis. It has a pretty Jardin Public. The native quarters
present a curious and lively scene.</p>

<p class='c022'>The journey from Laghouat to (130½ M.) Ghardaïa by the rough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Sahara road is very fatiguing. (Diligence every second day, in winter at
4 a.m., in summer at 5 p.m., in 30 hrs.; fare 30 or 25 fr.; motor-omnibus
projected.) The chief stages are: 220½ M. (from Boghari) <i>Tilghemt</i>
or <i>Tilrempt</i> (quarters), in an oasis of terebinths (p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>); 265 M. <i>Berrian</i>
(1936 ft.), a little town of 3800 inhab., the northmost settlement of the
Mozabites (17th cent.), lying on the chalky limestone plateau of the <i>Chebka</i>,
with a palm-oasis on the <i>Oued Bir</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>308 M. (from Boghari; 130½ from Laghouat) <b>Ghardaïa</b> (1805 ft.;
Hôt. du Sud; pop. 8200, incl. 5400 Mozabites), a free market, is one of
the most picturesque and interesting places in the Sahara. Situated on
the <i>Oued Mzab</i>, in a beautiful oasis, with 64,000 palms, the town is enclosed
by a lofty wall defended with towers, and is dominated by the
great minaret of the chief mosque. It holds high market on Fridays, and
has two places of amusement (for Arabian music and dances). Ghardaïa
is the headquarters of the <i>Mzab</i>, a small republic of towns which was
founded in the 11th cent. by fugitive Berber Ibadites (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>) after the
destruction of Tiaret, was presided over by a priestly caste (tholbas), and
in 1852 became a protectorate of the French who annexed it in 1882. The
<i>Mozabites</i> or <i>Mzabites</i>, who hold aloof from the other Mohammedans, are
often met with as artisans and small traders in the towns of the Tell Atlas
and in the oases of the E. Sahara, but in their old age they always return
to their original home. Their manners and customs are still somewhat
mediæval; their mosques with minarets in the form of blunted pyramids,
their curious cemeteries and tombs with votive offerings, and their schools
will be found interesting. Their language is a Berber dialect akin to
those of the Kabyles (p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>) and the Tuâreg, but Arabic and French also
are generally spoken.</p>

<p class='c022'>Among places worth seeing near Ghardaïa are (¾ M.) <i>Mélika</i>, with
its black inhabitants and large cemeteries, and (1¼ M.) <i>Beni-Isguen</i>, a
wealthy place of 5400 inhab., the sacred town of the Mozabite league,
from which Arabs and Jews are excluded, with a massive town-wall,
clean streets (smoking forbidden), and a loftily situated castle. The oldest
town of the league is <i>El-Ateuf</i>, founded in 1012, with 2000 inhab., 5½ M.
to the E. of Ghardaïa, on the caravan-route to (55½ M.) the Mozabite
colony of <i>Guerrara</i>. Other caravan-routes lead from Ghardaïa to the
S.W. viâ (166 M.) <i>El-Goléa</i> (1280 ft.), with its small oasis, to <i>In Salah</i>
and the <i>Tuat Oases</i>, and to the S.E. to (112 M.) <i>Ouargla</i> (p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Blida the train, running to the N.E., through orange-groves
and fields of vegetables, again descends to the Mitidja.
234 M. <i>Beni-Mered</i> (459 ft.), with fertile gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>239 M. <b>Boufarik</b> (164 ft.; Hôt. Benoît, Boul. National; Hôt.
Nemoz, Place Mazagran, D. 2 fr., quite good; Hôt. de la Gare,
humble; omn. to the Place Mazagran; pop. 6000), once a fever-stricken
village of peasants, is now the centre of trade for the produce
of the Mitidja. Around it are admirably irrigated vineyards and
orchards (oranges, mandarins, etc.), sheltered from the prevailing
winds by planes, thujas (arbor vitæ), or cypresses. Near it are factories
of perfume and immense wine-cellars. To the W. of the town
is the large <i>Marché Arabe</i> (cattle-market; Monday), 12 min. from
the Place Mazagran, or reached by a road direct from the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the right, farther on, we observe the hill-ranges of <i>Rovigo</i>
and <i>L’Arba</i> (pp. <a href='#Page_248'>248</a>, 247) and the <i>Jebel Bou-Zegza</i> (p. <a href='#Page_249'>249</a>).

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span><i>Algiers</i>, French <i>Alger</i>, Ital. <i>Algéri</i>, the capital of the French
colony of Algeria, with 154,000 inhab. (incl. 35,200 foreigners,
mostly Italians and Spaniards, 33,200 Mohammedans, and 12,500
Jews), seat of the archbishop of Algeria, a fortress, and a naval
harbour, lies in 36°47′ N. lat. and 3°2′ E. long., on the W. side
of the nearly semicircular *<i>Baie d’Alger</i>, which is bounded on
the W. by the <i>Pointe Pescade</i> (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), and on the E. by <i>Cape
Matifou</i> (p. <a href='#Page_248'>248</a>). It is the most important coaling-station on the
whole coast, and shares with Oran the chief trade of Algeria. The
town extends along the slopes of the <i>Sahel of Algiers</i>, a range of
hills about 44 M. long, culminating in <i>Mt. Bouzaréah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), continued
beyond the mouth of the <i>Oued el-Harrach</i> by low sand-hills,
and separated from the Tell Atlas by the <i>Mitidja</i> (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>). With
regard to climate, see pp. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>, 172.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the site of the Roman <i>Icosium</i>, an unimportant place on the road
to Tipasa and Cæsarea (Cherchell, p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>), <i>Bologgîn ez-Ziri</i> (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>),
about 940 (about the same date as the foundation of Miliana and Médéa)
founded the new colony of <i>Al-Jezaïr Beni Mezghanna</i>, so called from
the adjacent coast-islands (jezîra, pl. jezaïr) and from the Berber tribe
of the Beni Mezghanna who dwelt in this region. It is recorded that in
the 11th cent. the inhabitants of the new settlement used the old Roman
baths, of which there is now no trace, for their amusements and an old
Christian basilica for their worship. From that time the history of Al-Jezaïr
is a blank down to the end of the 15th cent., when it began
to serve the Moorish exiles from Spain (afterwards called Tagarins here)
as a base of their retaliatory expeditions against Spain. In 1509 or 1510
the Spaniards, in the course of their victorious career, occupied the
largest of the coast-islands, where they erected the fortress of <i>El-Peñón</i>,
and conquered the Mitidja which had recently been colonized by the
Arabian tribe of the Tsaliba. The little town, called <i>Argel</i> by the
Spaniards, was inhabited by Mohammedans, who in 1516 summoned to
their aid, from Djidjelli, <i>Horuk (Arudj) Barbarossa</i>, a Turkish pirate
of Christian descent. Horuk complied with the request and established
himself at Al-Jezaïr, where, after repelling a Spanish expedition under
Diego de Vera (1516), he erected the Jenina as his residence and the Kasba
as his citadel.</p>

<p class='c022'>Having fallen in a battle with the Spaniards near Tlemcen (p. <a href='#Page_187'>187</a>),
Horuk was succeeded by his brother <i>Kheireddin Barbarossa</i> (1518–36), who
became the real founder of the new barbaresco or piratical state. As a
vassal of the sultan of Turkey he extended his sway over the greater
part of Algeria. He defeated Hugo de Moncada, the Spanish viceroy, in
1519, and in 1530, after having stormed the fortress of Peñón, he constructed
the Jetée de Kheireddin with its materials and with others from
Rusguniæ (p. <a href='#Page_248'>248</a>) and Tipasa, thus creating the first harbour of Algiers.
Thenceforwards for three centuries the ‘Algerian pirates’ were the terror
of the seas, to whom, for protection of their trade, England, Holland,
the Hanseatic towns, and other maritime countries ignominiously consented
to pay tribute. Fourteen times the European powers, from the time of
the fruitless campaign of Charles V. in 1541 to the British expedition of
1824, had besieged and bombarded Algiers in vain. The beys (or, after
1600, deys) had succeeded in maintaining their position, and in 1627 had
even carried their piratical expeditions as far as Iceland. It was not
till 1830 that these barbarous piracies were put a stop to by the French,
and that the way was thus paved for conquest of the whole of Algeria.</p>

<p class='c022'>The most stirring events in the recent history of Algeria were the
conquest of Constantine (1837), the protracted struggles against <i>Abd el-Kâder</i>
(1839–47), the defeat of his Moroccan allies on the Oued Isly (1844),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the subjection of Great Kabylia (1856–7), the revolts of the natives in
1871–2, the rising of <i>Bou-Amama</i> in S. Oran (1881), the occupation of the
Sahara as far as Tidikelt and the Tuat oases (1892–1901), and lastly the
French advance towards Morocco (comp. p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The Algiers of the Turkish period consisted solely of the triangular
quarter on the slope of the <i>Kasba Hill</i>, between the old
landward gates, <i>Bab Azoun</i> on the S. and <i>Bab el-Oued</i> on the N.,
with the <i>Sûk</i> or Market Street (now Rue Bab-Azoun and Rue Bab
el-Oued) as its nucleus. Between these two gates ran the old Turkish
wall, on whose site lie the Boul. Gambetta (Pl. B, C, 3), on the S.,
and the Boul. Valée (Pl. C, 2), on the N. The French ramparts
constructed in 1845 extended the town as far as the present Boul.
Laferrière (Pl. C, 4, 5) to the S., and to the Boul. du Général Farre
to the N. (Pl. C, 1). Since the demolition of these fortifications in
1904 the industrial suburbs on the coast and the lofty villa-suburbs,
<i>Quartier d’Isly</i> (Pl. B, 4, 5), <i>Télemly</i> (Pl. A, 5, 6), and <i>Mustapha-Supérieur</i>
(Pl. A, 7, 8), which last is little frequented except in
winter, have all been brought within the precincts of the town.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. Lower Quarter of the Old Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The chief business parts of the town are the arcades, with their
numerous shops, in the Rue Bab-Azoun (Pl. C, 2, 3) and Rue Bab
el-Oued (Pl. C, 2; p. <a href='#Page_224'>224</a>), the Place du Gouvernement (Pl. C, 2;
p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>), the focus of all the tramways, and above all the spacious
<span class='sc'>Place de la République</span> (Pl. C, 3), with the gardens of <i>Square
Bresson</i> (band, see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), adorned with bamboos and magnolias, the
<i>Théâtre Municipal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), and the most showy cafés. Between
these two places and the sea, at a height of 65 ft. above the quay and
its warehouses, run the uniform rows of houses of the <span class='sc'>Boulevard
de France</span> (Pl. D, 2; p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>), the <span class='sc'>Boulevard de la République</span>,
completed in 1866, and the <span class='sc'>Boulevard Carnot</span> (Pl. C, 3, 4), with the
new <i>Préfecture</i> (Pl. 23; C, 4) in the Moorish style (1910). These
streets, together 1 M. long, form a coast-promenade, whence in clear
weather we enjoy a splendid *View of the blue bay, the Atlas Mts.
of Blida, and the distant Jurjura chain (p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>). In stormy weather,
however, the Rampe de l’Amirauté (Pl. D, 2; p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>) and the Boul.
Amiral Pierre (Pl. C, D, 1, 2; p. <a href='#Page_224'>224</a>) attract many walkers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sole <b>Harbour</b>, prior to the French period, was the <i>Ancien
Port</i>, or <i>Darse de l’Amirauté</i> (Pl. D, 2), constructed by Kheireddin
Barbarossa, once a nest of piratical vessels, and now a torpedo-boat
station and anchorage for yachts and fishing-boats. The new
<i>Port de Commerce</i> and <i>Port Militaire</i>, 213 acres in area, with the
<i>Quai de la Marine</i>, which was extended in 1908, have been formed
since 1848 at a cost of 46 million francs. They are protected by
the wave-beaten <i>Jetée du Nord</i>, 984 yds. long, the prolongation
of the old Jetée of Kheireddin (comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), and by the Jetée du
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Sud, 1350 yds. in length. The entrance is 268 yds. in breadth. A
second commercial harbour, the <i>Arrière-Port</i> (Pl. C, D, 5, 6), was
begun in 1898, but is still uncompleted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The harbour is approached by the <i>Rampes Magenta</i>, descending
from Boul. Carnot to the principal railway-station (p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>),
by the <i>Rampes Chasseloup-Laubat</i>, connecting the Boul. de la
République with the Douane (Pl. D, 3) and with the warehouses
and offices of the French steamboat-companies, and by the <i>Rampe
de l’Amirauté</i> (Pl. D, 2), on the old Jetée of Kheireddin. This jetty
or quay, the oldest of all, connects the old Porte de France on the
mainland (once the Turkish sea-gate) with what was once the island
of Peñón (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), now the <i>Presqu’île de l’Amirauté.</i> Walkers
may descend also by the <i>Escaliers du Bastion Central</i>, opposite
the Square Bresson (p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>), or from the Place du Gouvernement
by the <i>Escaliers de la Pêcherie</i>, past the mosque of that name
and the <i>Fish Market</i>, which is worth seeing in the early morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Quai du Nord, between the approach to the fish-market
and the old Porte de France, a pretty <i>Turkish Fountain</i> has been
preserved. Adjoining the neo-Moorish <i>Palais de l’Amirauté</i> (Pl. D, 2)
is the Turkish <i>Gate</i>, with two heraldic animals (panthers?), an
interesting relic of the Bordj Ras el-Moul which was burned down
in 1816. We notice also several muzzle-loading guns built into
the wall, now serving as bulkheads or as posts for mooring vessels.
Visitors are not admitted to the <i>Phare</i> (Pl. D, 2; lighthouse), a
relic of the Turkish fort erected in 1544 on the site of the Spanish
castle of Peñón, nor to the small <i>Station Zoologique</i> (Pl. D, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now follow the Boul. de France, past the handsome <i>Palais
Consulaire</i> (Pl. 19, D 2; chamber of commerce, exchange, etc.),
to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Place du Gouvernement</span>, the noisiest place in the town, crowded
with natives at all hours (concerts, see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>). The equestrian
statue, in bronze, of the <i>Duke of Orleans</i> (1810–42), a distinguished
general in the Algerian campaigns, is by the Piedmontese Carlo
Marocchetti (1845). Behind the statue, and half concealed by the
Boul. de France, is the curiously incongruous—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Mosquée de la Pêcherie</b> (Pl. 16, D 2; Arabic <i>Jâma el-Jedid</i>,
new mosque), erected by Turkish architects in 1660 for
adherents of the Hanefite ritual (p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>). It is a cruciform building
with nave and aisles, a huge central dome tastelessly painted inside,
a rich marble pulpit of Italian workmanship, and a square
minaret (now clock-tower). Entrance in the Rampe de la Pêcherie
(adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the E. of the Place du Gouvernement, adjoining
the Rue de la Marine (Pl. D, 2), the harbour-street of the Turkish
and early French period, is the small Place de la Pêcherie, the
site of the pirates’ <i>Slave Market</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Close by is the <b>Great Mosque</b> (Pl. 15, D 2; Arabic <i>Jâma el-Kebîr</i>),
the oldest and largest mosque in the town, founded in 1018
for believers in the Malekite ritual, but often altered since then.
Both the mosque and its minaret, originally built by the Abdelwadite
Abû Tâkhfîn (p. <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>) in 1322–3, have now been modernized.
The entrance is by a portico in the Rue de la Marine, erected in
1837 with materials from a mosque of the Jenina (p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>), leading
into a court, embellished with a Turkish fountain, and to the
unadorned sacred building itself, with its eleven aisles or arcades
and horseshoe arches resting on low pillars.</p>

<p class='c011'>The quarter to the N.W. of the Rue de la Marine, between
Boul. Amiral-Pierre (Pl. C, D, 1, 2) and Rue Bab el-Oued (see below),
is inhabited mainly by Italians and natives and still contains many
mediæval features in its sombre lanes and passages. Soon after
entering it, we come to a pleasing <i>Turkish House</i>, Rue Duquesne,
No. 15, in the small square of that name, with a marble portal
and a two-storied court.</p>

<p class='c011'>The building of the <b>Conseil Général</b> (Pl. 5a, D 2; adm., see
p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), close by, Rue de la Charte No. 5, a good example of Moorish-Turkish
architecture, with its Renaissance portal, was the British
consulate in the Turkish period. No. 29, in the adjoining Rue
d’Orléans, has a remarkably rich Italian Renaissance portal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The short Rue du Quatorze-Juin, the last houses in the Rue
des Consuls (Pl. D, 2), occupied by the other European consuls in
the Turkish period, and the adjacent narrow Rue Navarin and Rue
Jean-Bart, all have the character of the Kasba quarter (p. <a href='#Page_227'>227</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The narrow passage called Rue des Postes leads here to the
Rue Volland (Pl. C, 1), the cross-street between Boul. Amiral-Pierre
and the <span class='sc'>Avenue Bab el-Oued</span> (Pl. C, 1). Here, on the right, are
the barracks and the <i>Kursaal Theatre</i> (p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), and on the left
the <i>Lycée National</i>, on the site of the Turkish janissaries’ barracks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rampe Valée ascending hence to the Kasba quarter skirts
the *<b>Jardin Marengo</b> (Pl. C, 1), a public park, laid out in
1834–47 on the site of the Mohammedan cemetery; the grounds,
with their wealth of palms, yuccas, and bamboos, climb the hill-side
as far as the mosque of Sidi Abderrahmân (p. <a href='#Page_228'>228</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return by the <span class='sc'>Rue Bab el-Oued</span> (Pl. C, 2; p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>) to
the Place du Gouvernement. Halfway, in the Rue de la Kasba
(p. <a href='#Page_227'>227</a>), rises on the right the church of <i>Notre-Dame des Victoires</i>
(Pl. 8; C, 2), formerly a mosque (<i>Jâma Bitchnîn</i>, of 1622).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the W. side of the Place du Gouvernement (p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>) the
Rue du Divan and Rue du Soudan lead to the small <span class='sc'>Place Malakoff</span>,
on the E. side of which, between these streets, rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Archevêché</b> (Pl. 1, C 2; archbishop’s palace), the finest and
but little modernized relic of the <i>Jenina</i> founded by Horuk Barbarossa
(p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) in 1516. In the course of centuries this residence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the beys was gradually extended to the Rue Jenina and the Rue
Socgémah, and in 1816 was at length superseded by the Kasba
(p. <a href='#Page_227'>227</a>). The entrance is by the Renaissance portal (adm., see
p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>; apply to the concierge).</p>

<p class='c016'>The fine court, with its two stories and horseshoe arches resting on
slender winding columns, is remarkable for its harmonious proportions.
The walls are adorned with tiles of little value, but the rich wrought-iron
gratings of the windows deserve notice. The upper story, whose
galleries have small domed chambers at the four corners, is adjoined by
rooms sumptuously decorated like those of the Alcázar at Seville (p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>).
We note in particular the lavish ornamentation in stucco, the elegant
window-shutters, restored in part, and the beautiful ceilings in cedar
and oak panelling. The room converted into a chapel has been materially
altered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. 3, C 2; <i>St. Philippe</i>), on the W. side of
the same Place, built since 1843 in a strangely mingled Moorish
and Romanesque style, occupies the site of the <i>Ketshâwa Mosque</i>
erected by Hassan Pasha in 1791 (see below). The façade is adorned
with two towers resembling minarets. The first chapel contains
the bones of the so-called Gerónimo, a Christian Arab (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>), who is said to have been immured alive in 1569.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Palais d’Hiver du Gouverneur</i> (Pl. 21, C 2; adm., see
p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), built by Hassan Pasha (1791–9), like the National Library
(see below), is one of the latest specimens of Moorish-Turkish
architecture in Algeria; but it has been entirely remodelled to
suit its present purpose and has been provided with a new façade.
Above the old portal, Rue du Soudan No. 5 (now Bureau Arabe; see
p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>), is a pretty carved projecting roof. No. 7, next door, has
a rich marble portal. The roof affords a good survey of the whole
of the Jenina buildings.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of the Place Malakoff, in the Rue de l’Etat-Major,
No. 12, on the left, is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>National Library</b> (Pl. 2; C, 2), in the old palace of Mustapha
Pasha (1799–1805), containing about 40,000 vols. and 2000 MSS.
Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>. Librarian, M. E. Maupas.</p>

<p class='c016'>Adjoining the vestibule (skiffa), adorned with clustered columns and
Delft fayence, on the left, is the two-storied *Quadrangle, similar to
that of the archiepiscopal palace. In the gallery of the first floor are
views of Old Algiers (including the bombardment by the British fleet in
1824). Adjacent are two small reading-rooms containing a valuable collection
of Arabic, Berber, and Turkish MSS. (shown only on application
to the curator M. Abdeltif). The charters of the Turkish period also are
important.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Bureaux du Gouvernement</i>, Rue Bruce 10, which once
belonged to the Jenina buildings, also are worth seeing (apply
to the governor’s secretary). So, too, is the pleasing <i>Dwelling
House</i>, Rue Socgémah 12 (now owned by M. Ratto, goldsmith;
p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>).—The old <i>Dâr Soof</i> (wool-exchange), Rue de l’Intendance 1,
one of the most ornate Mauro-Turkish buildings in the town, is
now a private house and can be seen only by special introduction.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>We now turn to the E. to visit the Rue de Chartres or the Rue
de la Lyre (Pl. C, 2, 3), which, like the neighbouring Rue Randon
in the Kasba quarter (p. <a href='#Page_227'>227</a>), contain countless little shops kept
by Jews and Mozabites (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>). The <i>Marché de Chartres</i> and
the <i>Marché de la Lyre</i> (Pl. 14; C, 3) are the chief provision
markets. In the afternoon the former is devoted to the sale of
second-hand goods. The Rue de Chartres and the two flights of
steps in the Place de la Lyre, next to the theatre, lead back to the
Place de la République (p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>To the S. of the Place de la République are the new quarters
of the town. At the beginning of the <span class='sc'>Rue de Constantine</span> (Pl. C,
3, 4), on the left, is the new <i>Palais de Justice</i> (Pl. 20; C, 3), in
the pseudo-classical style. On the right is the new-Romanesque
church of <i>St. Augustin</i> (Pl. 9; C, 3).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the back of this church runs the Rue Dumont-d’Urville
(Pl. C, 3), passing almost immediately on the left the Rue de Tanger,
in which rises the small <i>Mosque of the Mozabites</i> (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>),
and leading to the long and monotonous <span class='sc'>Rue d’Isly</span> (Pl. C, 4).
The latter crosses the Place d’Isly. (Pl. C, 4), where a monument
has been erected to <i>Marshal Bugeaud</i> (1784–1849), the conqueror
of Abd el-Kâder (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on in the Rue de Constantine, on the left, at No. 32 is
the <i>Musée Municipal des Beaux-Arts</i> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), containing
a small collection of pictures mostly by French painters.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de Constantine and Rue d’Isly reach the boundary of
the old town at the new <i>Post Office</i> (Pl. 22, C, 4; p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>), a neo-Moorish
building (1910), on the N. side of the <span class='sc'>Boulevard Laferrière</span>
(Pl. C, 4, 5; p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>), or Boul. Militaire Sud. To the right,
above, are the handsome offices of the <i>Dépêche Algérienne</i> (p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>),
in the neo-Moorish style. The open space on the left, down by
the sea, is destined for the future <i>Central Station</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Boul. Laferrière to <i>Mustapha-Supérieur</i>, see pp. <a href='#Page_231'>231</a>,
230; to <i>Belcourt</i> and <i>Le Hamma</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The Kasba.</h4>

<p class='c016'>To avoid the steep ascents in the Kasba Quarter we take the tramway
(No. 6, p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>) to the Prison Civile, glance at the Mohammedan Cemetery
and the Kasba Barracks, and then descend from the Boul. de la
Victoire by one or other of the streets (very slippery in wet weather)
between the Rue de la Kasba (Pl. C, 2) and Boul. Gambetta (Pl. B, C, 3).
It should be noted that all the ascending streets lead to the Boulevard
de la Victoire, and the descending streets to Rue Randon or Rue Marengo.
Ladies in particular may sometimes gain admission to one of the better
Moorish houses (comp. p. xxvi), where they should not omit to see the
view from the roof. A walk through the Kasba quarter by moonlight is
delightful, but safe only for a considerable party.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The *<b>Kasba Quarter</b> (Pl. B, C, 2, 3), the almost unaltered
main portion of old Algiers, bounded by the Rue Randon, Rue
Marengo, and Boul. de la Victoire, lies on the hill-side below the
<i>Kasba</i>, the old castle and afterwards the residence of the Turkish
rulers, and still presents a highly attractive picture of Oriental life,
though partly inhabited by Maltese and Spaniards as well as by
Mohammedans of various races and creeds (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>). A few streets
only, with small mosques, coffee-houses, and shops, show signs of
life in the daytime, and that chiefly on Fridays and Sundays. Most
of the streets, however, often only 6–7 ft. wide, with their jutting
upper stories and balconies supported by brackets of beams, and
the numerous blind alleys and sombre vaulted passages are shrouded
in silence, while their bare, almost windowless walls and their closed
doors, marked with the sign of the warning hand (p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>), enhance
their impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief business street of the Kasba is the <span class='sc'>Rue Randon</span>
(Pl. C, 2, 3; comp. p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>), especially the S. part of it with its
shops, between the Marché de la Lyre (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>) and the <span class='sc'>Synagogue</span>
(Pl. 24, C 2; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), a building with a huge dome and
three women’s galleries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de la Girafe and Rue Caton, the last two side-streets
before the Synagogue, ascend to the <span class='sc'>Rue Kléber</span> (Pl. C, 2), where,
at the crossing of the Rue d’Anfreville and Rue du Palmier, opposite
an Arabian coffee-house, rises the small <i>Mosque of Sidi Mohammed
ech-Chériff</i> (Pl. 17; C, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue d’Anfreville leads to the left to the long <span class='sc'>Rue de la
Porte-Neuve</span> (Pl. C, 2, 3), a street starting from the Rue de la Lyre
(p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>). A little way down we may visit its side-streets, Rue des
Dattes and Rue Médée, and then return by the Rue de la Mer Rouge
to the upper part of the Rue Kléber. We may next follow the Rue
du Palmier (see above) and the Rue Annibal, or its side-street Rue
Tombouctou, to the long and steep <span class='sc'>Rue de la Kasba</span> (Pl. C, 2),
which ascends in steps from the Rue Bab el-Oued (p. <a href='#Page_224'>224</a>) to the
Kasba barracks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small square at the top of the Rue de la Kasba, adjoining
the <span class='sc'>Boulevard de la Victoire</span> (Pl. B, C, 2), is a resort of jugglers
and story-tellers, with their admiring audience.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the <i>Prison Civile</i> (Pl. B, C, 2; on the right), and
crossing the moat, we may now visit the Mohammedan <i>Cimetière
d’el-Kettar</i> (Pl. B, 2), prettily situated on the slope above the
<i>Frais-Vallon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Kasba</b> (Pl. B, 2; 427 ft.), originally an octagonal pile of
buildings, surrounded by large gardens, was erected by Horuk
Barbarossa in 1516, but was afterwards much altered. In 1816–30
it was the residence of the deys (comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), and now serves as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Zouave barracks. The large two-storied quadrangle in the Mauro-Turkish
style is a relic of the original building. The old mosque is
now used as a storehouse. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The road to El-Biar (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>) leads through the Kasba and then traverses
the old <i>Quartier des Tagarins</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), which extended to
the Porte du Sahel (Pl. B, 3).</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Prison Civile the steep <span class='sc'>Boulevard Valée</span> (Pl. C, 2;
p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>) leads back to the town, the lower part commanding a superb
*View of Algiers and its bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>This boulevard joins the <span class='sc'>Rue Marengo</span>, opposite the <span class='sc'>Medersa</span>
(Pl. C, 2; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), opened in 1904, one of the three recently
founded Mohammedan colleges of Algeria, a building in an appropriate
neo-Moorish style. No. 46, nearly opposite, is the pretty
little Medersa of the Turkish period.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Mosque of Sidi Abderrahmân</b> (Pl. 18, C 2; adm., see
p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), built in 1696 and dedicated to the learned marabout Sidi
Abderrahmân et-Tsalbi (1387–1468), the chief saint of the Tsaliba
(p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), has no attraction beyond its elegant minaret, adorned with
coloured tiles; but its situation near the Jardin Marengo (p. <a href='#Page_224'>224</a>),
and the charming view it commands, are most impressive. The
kubba of the saint is bedecked, as is usual in the case of such tombs,
with flags, ostrich-eggs, and other offerings. The small burial-grounds
attached are relics of the chief Mohammedan cemetery
(p. <a href='#Page_224'>224</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>c. Mustapha-Supérieur and Environs.</h4>

<p class='c016'>The narrow coast-plain, here called <i>Plaine de Mustapha</i>, is the somewhat
abrupt margin of the <i>Sahel</i>, to the S. of the old town, on which lie
the <i>Quartier d’Isly</i>, <i>Télemly</i>, and <i>Mustapha-Supérieur</i>, where the white
villas dating from the Turkish period, with their superb gardens and
luxuriant orchards, are occupied chiefly by English and American residents.
This is the favourite promenade of foreign visitors. Tramways Nos. 1, 2,
and 3, see pp. <a href='#Page_218'>218</a>, 219. To avoid ascents the traveller had better begin
his walk at the terminus of line No. 2 or No. 3.</p>

<p class='c009'>The main street of *<b>Mustapha-Supérieur</b> is the <span class='sc'>Rue Michelet</span>
(Pl. B, A, 5–8), a street nearly 2½ M. long, in line with the Rue
d’Isly. The first third of it is uninteresting. It passes the former
<i>Académie</i> (Pl. B, 5), situated on a high terrace below the Quartier
d’Isly, which was converted into a university in 1909 (1442 students).
Farther on the road leads through the suburb of <i>Agha-Supérieur</i>
to the (½ M.) so-called <i>Plateau Saulière</i> (Pl. B, 6, 7;
tramway-terminus, Station Sanitaire; p. <a href='#Page_218'>218</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The upper Rue Michelet, which, in spite of its steep hills, is
the most fashionable drive in Algiers, ascends, partly in windings,
past the hotels (p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>), a number of handsome villas, and several
charming points of view, to the top of the Sahel. Beyond the
<i>Scottish Church</i> (p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>) at the first sharp bend in the road, rises,
behind the view-terrace of the <i>Museum Garden</i>, the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>*<b>Museum</b> (<i>Musée National des Antiquités Algériennes</i>; Pl.
A, 6, 7), opened in 1897, containing the finest collection of the kind
in Algeria. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>. Catalogue rather old (1899). Director,
M. Stéphane Gsell.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Garden</span> contains a dolmen (of the Beni-Messous) from Guyotville
(p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), Roman tombstones, vases, etc.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the <span class='sc'>Vestibule</span> are views of Old Algiers, from the 17th cent. onwards.
Over the inner door is an early-Christian mosaic from Rusguniæ (p. <a href='#Page_248'>248</a>)
representing Christ as the Good Shepherd.—The <span class='sc'>Court</span> contains modern
views of Algiers and Arabic, Jewish, and Turkish inscriptions. In the
centre is a Roman mosaic from Sila, representing Scylla (p. <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>) and marine
deities.—On the right is—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room I.</span> The cases in the middle and most of the wall-presses
contain prehistoric antiquities from the provinces of Algeria and Oran
and from the Sahara, including the Flamand collection (1889–90). Along
the walls are ranged casts and copies of the graffiti or rock-drawings of
Tiout (p. <a href='#Page_202'>202</a>), Moghrar-Tahtàni (p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>), etc.; Libyan (early Berber) tomb-stelæ;
on the end-wall to the right, a warrior on horseback, from Abizar
in Great Kabylia; two cases with relics from Phœnician tombs at Gouraya
(some of them imported from Greece); also Punic tomb-stelæ, etc.—In
the centre are a fine mosaic from Aïn-Babouch and models of the mausoleum
of Le Khroub (p. <a href='#Page_273'>273</a>), of the so-called Tombeau de la Chrétienne
(p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>), and of the Medracen (p. <a href='#Page_274'>274</a>).—We now pass through R. IV
into—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room II.</span> In the centre are antique marbles: *Torso of a Venus (in
the style of the Capitoline Venus), draped female *Statue (replica of a
work of the age of Phidias; the head added later), colossal statue of Poseidon
(after a Greek original of the 4th cent.), torso of Bacchus, Satyr
and Hermaphrodite (after a group of the Hellenistic period; a torso), two
elegant decorative pillars, all of these coming from the so-called museum
of king Juba at Cherchell (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>); then a colossal bust of Minerva from
Khamissa; bronze *Figure of a boy with an eagle, from Lambèse. By the
wall next the court is a fragment of a sarcophagus-relief, Warrior with
wounded Amazon (Achilles and Penthesilea?). By the back-wall are casts
of the chief antiques of Cherchell, marble busts, including Jupiter Serapis
and a god of the lower regions, both from Carthage. The wall-cabinets
contain Greek and Etruscan vases and fragments of Roman sculptures
and inscriptions. Around are mosaics: Boar and panther hunt from
Orléansville; fragment of a representation of the Four Seasons, from
Lambèse; Europa with the bull, Jupiter and Antiope, Oceanus and Nereids.
In the centre is a relief-plan of Timgad (p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>).—We next pass
through R. V into—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room III.</span> Among the bronzes in the first case are a mask (3rd cent.
B. C.) from El-Grimidi; a statuette of Venus untying her sandal, from
Cherchell; adjacent, an early-Christian bronze lamp (5th cent.). Then
come cases with Greek, Roman, and Mauretanian coins, lamps, etc. The
case by the wall next the court contains early-Christian reliquaries (in
terracotta). Along the walls are ranged Roman and early-Christian inscriptions,
reliefs, and architectural fragments; by the entrance-wall is
the tombstone of a bishop from Mouzaïaville (5th cent.); by the end-wall
Roman busts (incl. Hadrian); a slab bearing regulations as to rights
of using water, from Lamasba (Mérouana); early-Christian sarcophagus
from Dellys (4th cent.).</p>

<p class='c022'>The corner-rooms (IV and V) contain the <span class='sc'>Oriental Section</span> (Art of
Islam), which has received considerable additions and for which five
new rooms are being prepared.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room IV.</span> Berber and early Moorish works of art. In the ante-room
Berber vases, tissues, and wood-carving from Great Kabylia, etc., incl.
an ancient Kabylian cradle. In the central case are Berber trinkets,
chiefly from Great Kabylia (Dra el-Mizan; work of the Beni-Yenni), and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Tunisian vases. Cases with Algerian bronzes and curiosities from Kalâa
des Beni-Hammad (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>; stucco-work, fragments of vases). Cases and
two wall-presses containing superb Moroccan embroidery (some showing
Spanish-Moorish influence), mostly from the region of Fez. A large
majolica vase from Palma (Majorca). Also, on the walls, *Carpets from
the district of Jebel Amour, from Kalâa (p. <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>), Kairwan, Rabât, and
of the tribe of the Rirha (near Sétif).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room V</span>, devoted mainly to the Mauro-Turkish art of the barbaresques.
At the entrance is a marble portal of Italian workmanship. Stands
with weapons (some of them in the Louis XVI. style), trinkets, richly embroidered
slippers, pistol-cases, cartridge-belts, etc., and also gorgeous
feminine apparel. On a stand, with gold embroidery from mosques and
saints’ tombs, is placed the cast of the so-called Gerónimo (p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>). By
the walls are two superb saddles, copper vessels, furniture inlaid with
mother-of-pearl, etc.; presses with Algerian *Embroidery (curtains of
ladies’ chambers, bath-veils, etc.). By the back-wall, Jewesses’ costumes
from Constantine. In the gallery are Smyrna carpets.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Rue Michelet, a few paces farther, beyond the Chemin
du Télemly (see below), is a small round space with a marble
<i>Statue of Mac Mahon</i> (1808–93; governor of Algeria in 1864–70).
Opposite, to the left, is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Palais d’Eté du Gouverneur</i> (Pl. A, 7), a fine neo-Moorish
building with beautiful grounds. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on we cross the Chemin de Gascogne or Chemin Romain,
the shortest route from Mustapha-Inférieur (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>) to the
Colonne Voirol (see below). Near the lower half of that road is the
<i>Orphelinat St. Vincent-de-Paul</i> (Pl. A, 7), on the site of a villa
of Mustapha Pasha (p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>), to whom this quarter owes its name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Following the Rue Michelet farther to the S. we pass, on the
right, the new <i>English Church</i> (p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), in the Moorish style. The
cost of building, which amounted to 7000<i>l.</i>, was defrayed by the
French Government in compensation for the site of the former
English church which was required for the new post-office (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the bifurcation of Boul. Bru (p. <a href='#Page_231'>231</a>) the Rue Michelet
takes a sharp turn to the N.W. and leads along the margin of the
so-called <i>Bois de Boulogne</i> (Pl. A, 8, 9), a sparse pine-wood, to
the <i>Colonne Voirol</i> (689 ft.; tramway-terminus, see pp. <a href='#Page_218'>218</a>, 219),
a monument in memory of General Voirol.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the finest and easiest walks at Mustapha-Supérieur is the
*<b>Chemin du Télemly</b> (Pl. A, B, 6–4), which diverges to the
right from the Rue Michelet just beyond the Museum garden (p. <a href='#Page_228'>228</a>)
and leads along the slope of the Sahel, halfway up, passing through
several verdant ravines (<i>Ravin des Sept-Sources</i>, etc.), to the
(1¾ M.) <i>Quartier d’Isly</i> (Pl. B, 4, 5), a charming, loftily-situated
villa-quarter. This road affords several splendid views of the bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Quartier d’Isly we may either descend by the Rue
Edouard-Cat and Avenue Pasteur to the lower Rue Michelet and the
Rue d’Isly (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>), or we may follow the main road as far as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>town-wall, between the Boul. Laferrière (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>) and the Porte du
Sahel (p. <a href='#Page_233'>233</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Side-roads connect the Chemin du Télemly with the <i>Campagne
Bellevue</i> (see below) on one side, and with <i>St. Raphaël</i> (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>) on the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the road, mostly bordered with hedges, which leads from
the Colonne Voirol (p. <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>) to (1¼ M.) <i>El-Biar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>), passing
the <i>Campagne Bellevue</i> (794 ft.) halfway, is monotonous, the
<b>Chemin de Maclay</b>, leading from the Colonne Voirol to (1¾ M.)
<i>Château-Neuf</i> (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>), is far preferable. It passes through the
upper valley of the <i>Oued Knis</i> (see below), verdant with fruit-trees,
eucalypti, and pines, runs to the N.W. to the (½ M.) <i>Café d’Hydra</i>,
and at the (½ M.) <i>Café-Restaurant du Retour de la Chasse</i> joins
the highroad coming from Blida.</p>

<p class='c016'>A little way to the S.W. of the Colonne Voirol, on the road from
Algiers to Douéra and Boufarik (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>), is the beautiful <i>Château d’Hydra</i>,
once a country-seat of the Deys, but now private property.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Colonne Voirol we may now walk through the <i>Bois de
Boulogne</i> (p. <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>), or follow the road to the S.E. in the valley of the
<i>Oued Knis</i>, past the sanatorium of Dr. Verhaeren and the <i>Villa
des Grottes</i> (curious rock sculptures, among others the expulsion of
Adam and Eve from Paradise), to (1 M.) the poor agricultural village
of <b>Birmandreis</b> (354 ft.; Café-Restaur. des Platanes). From
Birmandreis we have the choice of two routes. We may walk through
the <i>Ravin de la Femme Sauvage</i> (to the N.E. and E.), as the cool
and shady lower Oued Knis valley is popularly called, to (1¾ M.)
the village of <i>Le Ruisseau</i> (tramway No. 4, p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>), ½ M. beyond
the Jardin d’Essai (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>). Or we may take the road (to the S.E.
and E.), through orchards and market-gardens, and across a fine
open hill, to the (1¼ M.) poor village of <i>Vieux-Kouba</i> and (½ M.)
<i>Kouba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_233'>233</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Rue Michelet the <b>Boulevard Bru</b> (Pl. A-C, 8, 9;
p. <a href='#Page_230'>230</a>; tramway No. 3, see p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>) leads between villas, affording
near the farther end a beautiful view of Algiers, to (¾ M.) the <i>Cimetière
de Mustapha</i> (Pl. C, 9), incorporating the <i>English Cemetery</i>.
Here at the tramway-terminus the Boul. Bru joins the Chemin de
Fontaine-Bleue, a road coming up from Mustapha-Inférieur (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>).
We follow the latter road straight on to its junction with the
Chemin Shakespeare or des Crêtes, beyond which, in the same
direction, the Rue Laurent-Pichat brings us to the (¼ M.) <i>Villa
Sesini</i> (Pl. D, 9), superbly situated above Belcourt (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>). Straight
on we follow the Rue de Béhagle, a narrow field-road diverging
from the Rue Laurent-Pichat; this road after 5 min. leads to the
left, through a small oak-copse and past the <i>Fort des Arcades</i>
(Pl. D, 9), to the verge of the plateau (*Bench with view) and then,
taking the name of Chemin des Arcades, goes on to the hill-garden
of the <i>Jardin d’Essai</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>).</p>

  <h4 class='c023'>d. The S.E. Suburbs.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The only attractions here are the Mohammedan Cemetery at Belcourt
(near the Marabout station of tramway No. 4; p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>) and the Jardin
d’Essai. It is best to go to the latter by the inner line, just mentioned,
and to return by No. 5, the outer line.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suburbs of <i>Agha-Inférieur</i>, with its railway-station (p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>)
and the new Arrière-Port (p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>), <i>Mustapha-Inférieur</i>, <i>Belcourt</i>,
and <i>Le Hamma</i>, together with the adjacent little town of <i>Hussein-Dey</i>,
are the industrial quarters of Algiers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Along the coast, beyond Boul. Laferrière (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>), run the Rue
Baudin (Pl. C, 5), in line with the Rue de Constantine (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>), and
the <span class='sc'>Rue Sadi-Carnot</span> (Pl. B-E, 5–8), over 2½ M. long, from which,
at the N.E. angle of the <i>Champ de Manœuvres</i> (Pl. C, 7; also a
race-course), diverges the <span class='sc'>Rue de Lyon</span> (Pl. B-E, 7–9), 2 M. in
length, the route of the inner tramway-line (No. 4).</p>

<p class='c011'>The unattractive Rue de Lyon leads to (about ¾ M.) the <b>Cimetière
Musulman de Belcourt</b> (Pl. D, 9), the finest Mohammedan
burial-ground in Algiers, containing a number of handsome
monuments and the picturesque <i>Kubba</i> of Sidi Abderrahmân Bu-Kobrin
(d. 1793), a famous Algerian saint, a native of Great Kabylia.
Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>. As a rule only the side-entrance in the
Rue Colonel-Combes is open.</p>

<p class='c016'>The so-called <i>Grotte de Cervantes</i> (Pl. D, 9), with a bust and
memorial tablet of the famous Spanish author, who lived in captivity at
Algiers in 1575–80, is said to have been his hiding-place when attempting
to escape. Ascending a road from the end of the Rue Col. Combes
beyond the cemetery, we follow a (5 min.) path to the left, and turning
to the left again, somewhat downhill, we reach the (9 min.) grotto.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rue de Lyon next leads through the suburb of <i>Le Hamma</i>
to the (½ M.) *<b>Jardin d’Essai</b> (Pl. E, 9; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), or
<i>Jardin du Hamma</i>, the botanic garden of Algiers and at the same
time a nursery-garden and public promenade. Founded by government
in 1832 and frequently extended, it became the property of
the Compagnie Algérienne (p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>) in 1878. In wealth of vegetation
it vies with the botanic gardens of Palermo and Lisbon, which,
however, have been more advantageously laid out. It consists of
two sections: a hill-garden on the verge of the Sahel plateau and
the main garden in the once marshy, but now extremely fertile
coast-plain.</p>

<p class='c016'>Opposite the <span class='sc'>S. Entrance</span> of the main garden, in the Rue de Lyon,
is the dilapidated Mauro-Turkish <i>Fontaine du Hamma</i> (16th cent.). From
this point, near the small <i>Hôt.-Restaurant du Château Rouge</i>, the Chemin
des Arcades (p. <a href='#Page_231'>231</a>) ascends to the <b>Hill Garden</b>, a wooded park, with
tall araucarias, huge eucalypti, and other trees.</p>

<p class='c022'>Through the <b>Main Garden</b> a magnificent avenue of planes runs
from the chief entrance towards the sea. Halfway is a circular space
with a café. The W. half of the garden, to the left of the avenue, is
occupied by the less interesting nursery-garden.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The E. half of the garden is intersected by shady walks at right
angles to each other. Parallel with the main avenue are the narrower
dragon-tree and palm avenue and the magnolia and fig-tree avenue. The
chief cross-walks, parallel with the Rue de Lyon, are the date-palm, the
bamboo, and the dwarf-palm and rose avenues. From the S. entrance
we turn at once to the right into the date-palm avenue, where, from the
steps opposite the offices (‘administration’), we have a charming view of
the dragon-tree and palm avenue. Then, passing the magnolia and fig-tree
avenue, we go straight to the S. angle of the garden, where we are struck
with the profusion of tropical plants, outstanding among which are the
huge Ficus nitida with its exposed roots and a group of yuccas (the rare
Yucca draconis and other palm-lilies). A little lower down, near the
artificial island with its aquatic plants, are a group of *Strelitzias and
(beyond a tall Livistona australis) a beautiful little palm-grove. We next
follow the *Bamboo walk, and from it turn to the right into the *Dragon-tree
(p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>) and palm avenue, which leads towards the sea. Farther on,
to the left, beyond the dwarf-palm (Chamærops excelsa) and rose avenue,
is the small <i>Zoologie</i> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>), with a few specimens of Algerian
animals.</p>

<p class='c022'>Opposite the <span class='sc'>N. Entrance</span>, in the Rue Sadi-Carnot, at the station
of the outer tramway-line, rises a group of date-palms, where the cafés
<i>Oasis des Palmiers</i> and <i>Closerie des Palmiers</i> are much frequented by
the citizens in the afternoon (déj. 2½, D. 3 fr.). Beyond the railway line,
from the shore near the sea-baths (p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>; restaur.), we obtain a delightful
*View of Algiers. When the wind is to the N. or N.W. the breakers here
are grander than at the Rampe de l’Amirauté (p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rue Sadi-Carnot ends at the <i>Oued Knis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_231'>231</a>), on the outskirts
of the small town of <b>Hussein-Dey</b> (Hôt. de la Gare; railway
and tramway station; see pp. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>, 247), where the <i>Tobacco
Factory</i> has swallowed up the villa of the last deys of Algeria.
The inhabitants (5700) are mostly Spaniards from the Balearic
Islands (‘Mahonnais’), who grow early vegetables.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Hussein-Dey to <i>Maison-Carrée</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the village of <i>Le Ruisseau</i> (p. <a href='#Page_231'>231</a>), at the end of the Rue
de Lyon and at the mouth of the Ravin de la Femme Sauvage, a
road ascends in windings to the (1¼ M.) village of <b>Kouba</b> (427 ft.;
tramway No. 4, see p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>), in a charming, well-wooded site. At
the entrance to the village, on the site of a kubba, stands a <i>Church</i>
with a long flight of steps. The flat roof of the <i>Grand Séminaire</i>,
a training-college for priests founded by Card. Lavigerie (p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>;
adm. by leave of the Superior), commands an extensive *Panorama
of the Mitidja, the Atlas of Blida, and the Jurjura range.</p>

diligence several times daily to Chéraga and six times daily to Bouzaréah
(notices are posted in the Place du Gouvernement, at the corner
of Rue Bab-Azoun).</p>

<p class='c022'>A favourite circular trip for one day (motor-cars and carriages, see
p. <a href='#Page_218'>218</a>) embraces El-Biar, Château-Neuf, Chéraga, Staouéli-Trappe, Sidi-Ferruch
(p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), Guyotville (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), Pointe-Pescade (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), St. Eugène
(p. <a href='#Page_236'>236</a>), and Algiers. A popular drive for half-a-day includes Bouzaréah,
Forêt de Baïnem, Bains Romains (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), Pointe Pescade, and Algiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>(1). The road to <span class='sc'>El-Biar</span> leads from the old town through the
Kasba and the <i>Porte du Sahel</i> (Pl. B, 3; comp. p. <a href='#Page_228'>228</a>). Walkers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>may note two possible digressions. To the left, just outside the
gate, a path descends in 10 min. to <i>Boul. Laferrière</i> (p. <a href='#Page_226'>226</a>). To
the right, 2 min. farther, diverges the Chemin de Fontaine-Fraîche
(Pl. A, 3, 4), the road to (10 min.) the charmingly situated village
of <i>Birtraria</i>, whence one may either ascend to the S.W. in 20 min.
to <i>El-Biar</i> (see below), or walk to the N.E. through the pretty
<i>Frais-Vallon</i> and then descend the Avenue du Frais-Vallon (Pl. A,
B, 2, 1), on the right bank of the <i>Oued M’Kacel</i>, to (½ hr.) the
<i>Quartier Bab el-Oued</i> (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>The highroad passes near the foot of the <i>Fort l’Empereur</i>
(Pl. A, 4; 689 ft.), almost hidden by trees. This was the site of the
camp of Charles V. (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), and on it was built the <i>Mulaï Hassan
Fort</i> (1545), which was partly blown up by its Turkish defenders
when bombarded by the French in 1830. The road then winds up
to the tramway station of <i>St. Raphaël</i> (788 ft.), whence a charming
road branches off to (1¼ M.) <i>Mustapha-Supérieur</i> (to the left, and
after 3 min. to the left again, joining the <i>Chemin du Télemly</i> close
to the Hôt. Continental).</p>

<p class='c011'>The large village of <b>El-Biar</b> (784 ft.), 2 M. to the S.W. of the
Porte du Sahel, and the village of <i>Château-Neuf</i> (*Hôt.-Restaur.
Mallard, pens. from 6 fr.; a favourite Sunday afternoon resort),
lying on the monotonous plateau ½ M. beyond El-Biar, uninteresting
in themselves, are the starting-points of the roads to the <i>Colonne
Voirol</i> and to <i>Bouzaréah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>A road leads from Château-Neuf to (5½ M. from the Porte du Sahel)
<i>Chéraga</i> (650 ft.; Hôt. des Voyageurs, humble), a pleasant village among
fruit-trees, and (3 M.) <i>Staouéli-Trappe</i> (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), situated on a shelf-like
terrace above the coast, where the French first encountered the troops
of the dey in 1830. The old Trappist monastery founded here in 1843
was purchased in 1904 by the Swiss Consul Borgeaud, who has converted
the abbey-lands of about 3000 acres into a model farm (no admittance).
The burial-ground contains the tomb of Col. Marengo (1787–1862).</p>

<p class='c022'>From Staouéli-Trappe a road descends to the N.W. to (1 M.) <i>Staouéli</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>). The highroad joins the Castiglione road at (11 M.) <i>Sidi-Ferruch</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), a station on the steam-tramway.</p>

<p class='c009'>(2). <span class='sc'>To Bouzaréah</span> a new road (2½ M.) leads to the N.W. from
<i>El-Biar</i> (see above), through the pretty valley of the <i>Oued bel-Elzar</i>,
one of the feeders of the Oued M’Kacel (see above), while
the old road (2 M.) leads to it from <i>Château-Neuf</i> (see above),
crossing an uninteresting plateau and, about ½ M. short of Bouzaréah,
passing the <i>Ecole Normale Primaire</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>A more interesting route to (5 M.) Bouzaréah is from the <i>Quartier
Bab el-Oued</i> (Pl. B, 1), formerly the N.W. suburb of Algiers, inhabited
chiefly by Spaniards. From the Boul. du Général-Farre
or Boul. Militaire Nord (Pl. C, 1; p. <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>) we follow the Avenue
de la Bouzaréah (Pl. C, B, 1) and the Avenue Beau-Fraisier, in the
old suburb of <i>Cité Bugeaud</i>, to the Pont du Beau-Fraisier crossing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the Oued M’Kacel. We thence ascend the fine Chemin des Carrières,
passing near the blue-limestone quarries on the spurs of Mont
Bouzaréah, then through a side-valley of the Frais-Vallon (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>),
with its luxuriant vegetation, and lastly mount in windings past
the <i>Hospice des Vieillards</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The village of <b>Bouzaréah</b> (1230 ft.; Hôt. de France, humble;
pop. 2500), in an open site on the crest of <i>Mont Bouzaréah</i> (1335 ft.),
the culminating point of the Sahel, is a favourite goal for excursionists
in summer. A road leads to the N.E. from the village, past
the <i>Fort de la Bouzaréah</i>, on the left, and the <i>Christian Cemetery</i>,
on the right, to (¾ M.) the <i>Observatoire d’Alger</i> (1148 ft.). The roof
of the observatory affords a fine view of the Bay of Algiers and of
the hills of Great Kabylia as far as Cape Bengut (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Observatory we may descend either to the E. by the steep
Chemin Sidi Ben-Nour, passing the fort of that name, to the <i>Avenue des
Consulats</i> (see below), or to the N. by a steep and stony path to the <i>Vallée
des Consuls</i> (p. <a href='#Page_236'>236</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>A road leads to the N.W. from Bouzaréah in ¼ hr. to the poor
huts of the <i>Village Arabe de la Bouzaréah</i>, on the slope of a flat
hill (1178 ft.), overgrown with cacti and dwarf-palms, where we
have a splendid *View of the forest of Baïnem, Cape Caxine (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>),
the S.W. chain of the Sahel, with the ‘Tombeau de la Chrétienne’
(p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>), and Jebel Chenoua (p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), as also of the Blida Atlas
with the deep incision of the Chiffa Ravine (p. <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Arab village the road descends to the W. to the (1¼ M.)
<b>Forêt de Baïnem</b>, the largest wood (1250 acres) near Algiers. We follow
the ‘Route Forestière Wendling’, high on the slope of the Sahel, with
a fine view of the coast between Pointe Pescade (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>) and Cape Caxine,
at first through underwood, richly carpeted with flowers in spring. We
then pass through the remains of a pine-forest to the (1¾ M.) <i>Rond des
Eucalyptus</i>, a bifurcation in a small eucalyptus grove (straight on is
the Route Forestière Mignerot leading to Guyotville, 3¼ M.; p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>).
We follow, to the right, the beautiful Route Forestière Combe (2 M.),
which descends through groups of cork-trees, pines, and eucalypti, past a
ravine, to the <i>Maison Forestière</i>, whence it is continued by a eucalyptus
and mimosa avenue down to <i>Villas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), on the Castiglione road, a
station on the steam-tramway.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>f. Notre-Dame d’Afrique and St. Eugène.</h4>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Tramway</span> (No. 1, p. <a href='#Page_218'>218</a>) to the Hôpital du Dey; thence an omnibus
every ½ hr. (1–4 pers. 1 fr. 20 c.; each addit. pers. 30 c.) to the church of
Notre-Dame d’Afrique.—<span class='sc'>Tramway</span> (No. 7, p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>) to St. Eugène. The
terminus ‘Deux-Moulins’ is only a few paces from the station of the steam-tramway
to Castiglione (R. 35).</p>

<p class='c009'>The tramway through the Avenue des Consulats ends at the
<i>Hôpital Militaire du Dey</i> (Pl. A, B, 1), which, with its gardens,
occupies the site of a villa of Hassan Pasha (p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>). We follow
the Boul. de Champagne, and then diverge to the right by the Route
de Notre-Dame d’Afrique (½ hr.), a narrow road, shady towards
evening, affording splendid *Views of the Bay of Algiers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The large domed church of <b>Notre-Dame d’Afrique</b> (443 ft.),
a pilgrimage-church for sick persons and mariners, founded by
Card. Lavigerie in 1872, rises conspicuously on a spur of the N.E.
slope of <i>Mont Bouzaréah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), above the Christian and the
Jewish burial-grounds (see below). From the terrace in front of
the church, where the blessing of the sea by the clergy every Sunday
at 3.30 attracts many spectators, we survey the coast as far as the
Pointe Pescade (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>). Behind the church is the <i>Hôt. Bompard</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Vallée des Consuls</i>, which has its name from the villas of
the European consuls of the Turkish period, a shady and extremely
fertile vale above <i>St. Eugène</i> (see below), affords charming walks.
A pleasant road leads through it from Notre-Dame d’Afrique, shaded
by gnarled old olive-trees. We may thence mount to the <i>Observatory</i>
(comp. p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), or else descend in 20 min. to St. Eugène;
but the descent viâ <i>Fort Duperré</i> to <i>Deux-Moulins</i> (p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>) is
very rough and fatiguing.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the lower end of the Boul. du Général-Farre (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>),
beyond the still uncompleted <i>Quartier de l’Esplanade</i> (Pl. C, 1),
runs the <span class='sc'>Avenue Malakoff</span> (Pl. C, B, 1), close to the shore and
protected against the breakers by a high limestone wall, leading to
the <i>Fort des Anglais</i>, an old Turkish fort on a rocky headland.
Opposite, to the left, on the spurs of Mont Bouzaréah, lie the
<i>Christian Cemetery</i> and the interesting <i>Jewish Cemetery</i> of Algiers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the cemeteries we come to the little town of <b>St. Eugène</b>
(Hôt.-Restaur, du Château-Vert, déj. 2½, D. 3 fr.; Restaur. Deux-Moulins;
pop. 4800, incl. 500 Jews), with several factories and
pretty villas. The tramway-terminus, <i>Deux-Moulins</i>, at the N.W.
end of the town, is the starting-point for walks to the <i>Pointe Pescade</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>), the <i>Forêt de Baïnem</i> (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), and other places.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Algiers to (3¾ M.) <i>Deux-Moulins</i> (<i>St. Eugène</i>), see
pp. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>, 236. Here begins the finest part of the coast-road, which
will repay walkers as far as Cape Caxine or Guyotville. The spurs
of <i>Mont Bouzaréah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), furrowed by many little ravines,
come close down to the sea. The coast, undermined at places by the
surf, presents a picturesque series of small headlands, bold cliffs,
and rocky islets.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most striking spot is the (5 M.) *<b>Pointe Pescade</b> (Restaurant),
a headland crowned with the mouldering walls of a Turkish
fort (1671), overlooking the blue sea and the coast as far as
Cape Matifou and beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>By road and railway we next come to the (5½ M.) <i>Bains Romains</i>
(Hôt.-Restaur.) and the <i>Hôt. de la Fontaine Romaine</i>, both
sea-bathing places in summer, to (7 M.) <i>Villas</i>, lying below the
<i>Forêt de Baïnem</i> (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), and to (8 M.) <i>Cape Caxine</i>, on the gneiss
rocks of which rises a <i>Lighthouse</i> (210 ft.; visible 24 M. round).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the precipitous <i>Grand Rocher</i> lies (9½ M.) <i>St. Cloud-sur-Mer</i>,
a sea-bathing place. The coast now grows flatter.</p>

<p class='c011'>10 M. <b>Guyotville</b> (82 ft.; Hôt. des Touristes, humble), a village
of 3500 inhab., with a colony of Italian peasants, who cultivate
early vegetables and grapes on the sandy soil, protected from
the sea-winds by plantations of Spanish reeds (Arundo donax) and
in spring by narrow fields of rye. On the plateau to the S. of the
village, in the territory of the tribe of <i>Beni-Messous</i>, a number of
dolmens (see pp. <a href='#Page_324'>324</a>, 229) still exist.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Guyotville to the <i>Forêt de Baïnem</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Near the low headland of <i>Râs Acrata</i> the road reaches the broad
*<i>Bay of Castiglione</i>, much exposed to N.W. gales, which extends
in a slight curve to <i>Jebel Chenoua</i> (p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), a hill we sighted soon
after leaving Guyotville. We have a view also of the pretty adjoining
bay of Sidi-Ferruch. To the right, near (12½ M.) <i>Les Dunes</i>,
part of the sand-hills is cultivated.</p>

<p class='c011'>13 M. <i>La Trappe</i> and (14½ M.) <i>Staouéli</i> (Hôt. Malakoff, quite
good) are stations for <i>Staouéli-Trappe</i> (p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From Staouéli and from the (15½ M.) <i>Station Sidi-Ferruch</i>
roads lead to the N.W. (one 2¼, the other 2 M.) to the small sea-bathing
village of <b>Sidi-Ferruch</b> (49 ft.; Hôt. de la Plage, plain),
at the end of a sandy tongue of land formed by the surf and by the
deposits of the Oued Mazafran (p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>). It attracts also jackal-hunters
and anglers from Algiers in winter. An inscription at the
entrance to the <i>Fort</i> recalls the landing of French troops here in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>1830 (comp. p. <a href='#Page_234'>234</a>). A little to the N.W. are the scanty remains
of an <i>Early Christian Church</i>, with baptistery, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we proceed, the Atlas of Blida (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>) is visible for a time.
18 M. <i>Zéralda</i> (62 ft.; Hôt. de Zéralda), an agricultural village,
lies in a broad coast-plain, the lowest of four old beach-terraces
which mount to the N.E. in gigantic steps to Staouéli-Trappe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road now leads between low sand-hills, with pines and
underwood, to the <i>Oued Mazafran</i> (called in its upper course Oued
Chiffa, p. <a href='#Page_213'>213</a>), through whose valley, deeply furrowing the Sahel,
we have another glimpse of the Atlas of Blida.</p>

<p class='c011'>22 M. <i>Mazafran</i>, on the left bank of the stream, is the junction
of a branch-line to (6¼ M.) the little town of <i>Koléa</i> (460 ft.;
Hôt. de France; Hôt. du Commerce), founded by Andalusian Moors
in 1550, finely situated on the S. slope of the Sahel, and noted for
its fruit-culture. The Jardin des Zouaves deserves a visit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next stations are for the use of villages situated above the
line, on the N. margin of the Sahel plateau. 23½ M. <i>Douaouda-les-Bains</i>,
25½ M. <i>Fouka-Marine</i>, two small sea-bathing places. In
the distance, on the crest of the Sahel, appears the Tombeau de
la Chrétienne, resembling a haystack.</p>

<p class='c011'>28½ M. <b>Castiglione</b> (128 ft.; Hôt. du Tapis-Vert, good;
Hôt. de Paris; Hôt. de l’Oasis, humble) is a large village of 2000
inhab., on the vine-clad slope of the Sahel. Below are the unpretending
sea-baths, where lodgings may be procured.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>High Road to</span> (43½ M.) <span class='sc'>Tipaza</span>, affording at first a beautiful
view of the coast, of Jebel Chenoua, and the hills of the Dahra
(p. <a href='#Page_209'>209</a>) beyond Marengo, leads viâ the fishing-villages of (30 M.)
<i>Chiffalo</i> (founded by Sicilian fishermen from Cefalù) and (31 M.)
<i>Bou-Haroun</i>, whose inhabitants are engaged in the anchovy and
sardine fishery, to (33½ M.) <i>Bérard</i> (66 ft.; Café-Hôt. Bérard,
poor), a banana-growing village.</p>

<p class='c011'>36 M. <i>Ferme Seuillet</i> (102 ft.), a large farm, is the starting-point
for the <i>Tombeau de la Chrétienne</i>. The rough road to the
tomb (2½ M.) ascends in windings (partly avoided, after 10 min.,
by a short-cut to the left), at first through underwood, and then to
the S.W. through vineyards.</p>

<p class='c011'>The so-called *<b>Tombeau de la Chrétienne</b> (856 ft.; Arabic
<i>Kbûr er-Rûmia</i>), the largest tomb in the Atlas regions and one
of the most conspicuous of sailors’ landmarks on the whole coast
of Algeria, stands on one of the highest points of the S.W. range
of the Sahel. It was probably erected by Juba II. (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>), in imitation
of the Medracen (p. <a href='#Page_274'>274</a>), as a tomb for his family. The
building consists of a low square pedestal, of about 70 yds. each way,
and a circular substructure relieved by sixty Ionic half-columns
and four blind portals, crowned with a pyramid rising in steps, of
which 33 still exist. The present name is derived from the cruciform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>mouldings of the door-panels. The monument, originally
130 ft. in height, but now 108 ft. only, has suffered severely from
the vandalism of native treasure-hunters, who bored two tunnels
into it, and from bombardment by two deys of Algiers, bent on the
same quest. Further damage was done by earthquakes in 1825 and
1867, and the masonry also has been loosened by the removal of its
leaden cramps. The building is surrounded by dense underwood
and is partly overgrown by it on the N. side. Key and candles at
the keeper’s hut on the N.E. side (fee 50 c.).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Entrance</span> is under the blind portal on the E. side, where the
original vestibule has almost disappeared. A short passage leads to the
antechamber; in the wall on the right, near two rude reliefs (lion and
lioness), is a passage, once closed by stone slabs, with a flight of seven
steps. Beyond this is a winding gallery, about 165 yds. long, probably
destined for funeral processions, with small wall-niches for lamps. The
gallery leads to the two inner chambers, an ante-room, and the larger
chamber, with three wall-niches, in the centre of the monument, probably
the tomb of the kings, but now quite empty.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Ascent</span> of the monument, from the S. side, rather a toilsome
climb, conveys a still more striking idea of its grandeur than the long
groping in the inside. The *Panorama from the top embraces the coast,
from Sidi-Ferruch to Jebel Chenoua; the hills of the Dahra, with Jebel
Zaccar Chergui (p. <a href='#Page_212'>212</a>) to the S.W.; the broad Mitidja plain to the S.;
and the Atlas of Blida with the ravine of the Chiffa.</p>

<p class='c009'>We return to the Ferme Seuillet by the same route, or descend
to the N.W. by the steep road to (37½ M.) the <i>Ferme du Rocher-Plat</i>
(85 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The highroad next passes the (42 M.) <i>Ferme Demonchy</i>, intersects
a beautiful eucalyptus-grove, and passes the E. hill of Tipaza
(p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>). In approaching Tipaza we obtain a charming view of its
little bay and the lighthouse.</p>

<p class='c016'>43½ M. <b>Tipaza.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotel.</span> <i>Hôtel du Rivage</i>, prettily situated
at the S. base of the lighthouse hill, with a small garden, R. 2½, B. ½,
déj. or D. 2½–3, pens. 7 fr.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Tipaza</i>, a small seaport of 2000 inhab., mostly Mohammedans,
founded in 1854, stands on the ruins of <i>Tipasa</i>, a place with a
Berber name, but originally an ancient Phœnician settlement, and
from the time of Emp. Claudius (about 40 A. D.) a Roman colony.
Thanks to its advantageous site near the Nador valley, the main
outlet in Roman times of the densely-populated W. Mitidja, Tipasa
became in the 2nd cent. one of the most prosperous seaports of
Mauretania. The most glorious period in its history was at the
close of the 4th cent. when Tipasa, famed for its staunch adherence
to the Catholic faith, repelled the attacks of Firmus, the Berber
prince (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>); but after a century of prosperity most of the inhabitants
fled to Spain in 484 in order to escape from the persecutions
of Hunerich, king of the Vandals. Since its occupation by the
Arabs the old town, already much impoverished, has disappeared
from the page of history.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The site of Tipaza, secluded and peaceful, is strikingly picturesque.
The adjoining coast is richly varied, and close by rise the
great limestone rocks of Mt. Chenoua. At the same time there are
remains of numerous Roman and early-Christian buildings around,
all in complete ruin, and partly overgrown with luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ancient Tipasa, originally occupying only the central castle-hill,
which now bears the lighthouse (see below), gradually extended
over the coast-plain to the S. of the bay, and also along
the slopes of the W. and E. hills. The late-Roman <i>Town
Walls</i>, 2410 yds. in length, are still traceable at places. The
busy trade of the port led, probably at an early period, to the
construction of a broad <i>Landing Place</i> with substantial quays, the
space for which was obtained by the levelling of the rocky terrace
on the coast. The Roman <i>Outer Harbour</i>, behind the rock-islets
near the E. hill, probably served as a place of refuge in stormy
weather only. Since the middle ages the coast-line has been much
modified by the encroachments of the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>We begin our walk on the N. side of the village, at the present
<i>Harbour</i>, which occupies the site of the now submerged Roman
landing-place.  The huge rock (possibly used as a mausoleum),
undermined by the sea, which rises in the middle of the harbour,
was left untouched by the Roman engineers. During the construction
of the new harbour the remains of a Roman <i>Cistern</i> and underground
<i>Conduits</i> were unearthed.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the harbour we walk to the N., round a small bay, to the
<span class='sc'>Lighthouse Hill</span> (112 ft.), gorgeous with flowers in spring, where
a few vestiges of Roman streets, cisterns, and a temple are traceable
(see above). At the <i>Lighthouse</i> (phare) we obtain a delightful
view. Near it, on the N. margin of the hill, a precipice has been
formed by a landslip.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road connecting the highroad with the harbour and the
lighthouse hill leads past the Hôtel du Rivage and through the
*<b>Thermæ</b>, a grand bath-house of the 2nd or 3rd cent., rivalling
the W. baths of Cherchell (p. <a href='#Page_246'>246</a>). Among the ruins, still 30 ft.
high in places, extending into the Jardin Trémaux, the frigidarium
on the E. side is still quite recognizable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the hotel, to the left, we enter the <b>Jardin Trémaux</b>
(adm. kindly granted), the garden of a private estate, adorned with
antique and early-Christian relics. On the E. side, near the baths,
we observe, protected by a roof, a fine late-Roman sarcophagus,
bearing nuptial and sacrificial scenes. Near it is an old Christian
sarcophagus, with Christ, the Good Shepherd (beardless); on the
sides are lions tearing a gazelle to pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the middle of the grounds, to the left of the road, are a few
relics of a Roman <i>Amphitheatre</i> (3rd cent.?), which even during
the French period has served as a quarry.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>The road, farther on, passes the <b>Nymphæum</b> (on the left), a
sumptuous late-Roman fountain (3rd or 4th cent.), 26 yds. in breadth,
backed with a semicircular wall. In front of it is a platform 6½ ft.
high, once bedecked with Corinthian columns and with statues, over
which the water descended into a narrow trough or basin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately behind the fountain is a well-preserved vault, once
the <i>Reservoir</i> for the water brought to Tipasa by an underground
conduit, 5½ M. long, from the valley of the Nador. A few paces
away are the noteworthy ruins of a Roman <i>Mausoleum</i> (1st cent.?).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Roman Theatre</i>, at the exit of the gardens, to the right
of the park-road, yielded the materials for building the hospital
of Marengo. Several tiers of seats are still traceable.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the <i>W. Gate</i>, of whose round towers alone a few relics
remain, we follow the vestiges of the town-walls to the N. W. to the
(5 min.) <span class='sc'>West Hill</span> (about 100 ft.), the <i>Râs el-Knissa</i> (‘church
promontory’) of the natives.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the right of the town-walls, just above the undermined
margin of the coast-terrace, some fragments of a wall and
two arcades of an aisle mark the site of the <b>Bishop’s Church</b>
of Tipasa. Erected in the 4th cent., the church was a basilica,
57 yds. by 49 yds., with nave and triple aisles; the nave, 14½ yds.
in breadth, was afterwards trisected by the addition of two rows
of columns; little remains of the semicircular choir-recess.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the square <i>Baptistery</i>, on the N. side of the church, there
remain the round font, with three steps, and fragments of the external
walls. An adjoining chamber has a fine mosaic pavement;
several other rooms show traces of a heating apparatus.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the left, to the W. of the town-walls, lay the early-Christian
<i>Western Cemetery</i>, with countless rock-tombs, sarcophagi, and
monuments sadly desecrated by herds of cattle. About a hundred
paces to the N. of the church, in the rocks rising above the sea, are
several <i>Grottes Funéraires</i>. Near them is a large round <i>Mausoleum</i>,
once adorned externally with sixteen half-columns, containing
fourteen wall-niches (arcosolia) for coffins and the slab of a
table for love-feasts (agapai).</p>

<p class='c011'>About 2 min. to the S. W. is the <i>Burial Church of Bishop Alexander</i>,
built at the end of the 4th cent., a small basilica with nave
and aisles, of irregular shape, of which the foundations only remain.
On the E. side is a rectangular altar-niche with nine sarcophagi,
containing, as the eulogistic inscription in the nave declares, the
remains of ‘the nine righteous men’ (probably the nine predecessors
of Alexander). The right aisle contains many sarcophagi and a
semicircular table for love-feasts. At the W. end of the nave are a
mosaic with fish in seven rows and an inscription in memory of
the founder, who was probably buried in the W. apse, added later,
and accessible by a narrow portal only.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>We now return to the harbour, and ascend thence, close to the
sea, past the remains of a small <i>Roman Burial Ground</i>, to the
(10 min.) <span class='sc'>East Hill</span> (115 ft.), outside the town-walls where thousands
of graves indicate the great extent of the early-Christian
<i>Eastern Cemetery</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, beyond a few peasants’ huts, we reach the best-preserved
ruin at Tipasa, the *<b>Basilica of St. Salsa</b>, the patron saint of
the town. This church, built in the first half of the 4th cent,
over the heathen sarcophagus of Fabia Salsa, was a square burial-chapel,
about 16 yds. each way, with nave and aisles, but in the
5th or 6th cent. was prolonged westwards into a basilica 33½ yds.
long, with a vestibule and with galleries over the aisles. At the
same time the remains of the saint were transferred to a Roman
sarcophagus, which was placed on a high pedestal in the old
nave, now the choir of the enlarged church. The rows of clumsy
columns in the nave are a later addition. The walls between the
choir-pillars belong to a restoration of the 7th or 8th century.
Among the ruins of the walls, still 10–12 ft. high at places, lie Ionic
capitals and other fragments in picturesque confusion. Near the
façade are preserved relics of the old stairs to the galleries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small <i>Chapel</i> and the square <i>Hall</i> (later a burial-place)
on the S. side of the church date perhaps from the 4th century.</p>

<p class='c016'>An *<span class='sc'>Excursion to Cape Chenoua</span> will be found attractive. We first
follow the Cherchell road for 1 M.; we then turn, beyond the <i>Ferme
Trémaux</i> (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>), to the right and cross the Nador valley to the small
sea-baths of <i>Chenoua-Plage</i>, at the E. base of Mt. Chenoua. A narrow
road leads thence, up and down hill, along the beautiful <i>Baie du Chenoua</i>
to the <i>Anse des Grottes</i>, which owes its name to the numerous caves in
the limestone rocks (<i>Grottes du Nador</i>). On the narrow coast-terrace
between (7½ M.) <i>Cape Chenoua</i> and the <i>Râs el-Amouch</i> is the secluded
settlement of a French contractor, who with a staff of Spanish hands
carries on a cement-factory and quarries the red marble of the cape,
which was already known to the Romans.</p>

<p class='c022'>The ascent of *<b>Jebel Chenoua</b> is interesting, both for the sake of
the view from the top and for the glimpse it affords of its peculiar,
purely Berber inhabitants. From the hilly coast-road just mentioned the
route ascends to <i>Tenzirt</i> and (2–2¼ hrs.) a <i>Pass</i> (about 2300 ft.) between
the two chief heights of the Chenoua. Thence in 40 min. more we reach
the E. peak (2976 ft.), crowned with the kubba of <i>Lalla Tefouredj</i> (Berber
<i>Lalla Tzaforalz</i>). The path descending from the pass to <i>Desaix</i> (see below)
will be found convenient.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Road from Tipaza</span> to (17 M.) <span class='sc'>Cherchell</span> (diligence, see
p. <a href='#Page_236'>236</a>) branches off to the W. from the Marengo road at (2 M.)
<i>Gué du Nador</i> (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>), crosses the stream, and leads past (3 M.)
<i>Desaix</i> (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>), through a bleak tract at the foot of Mt. Chenoua.</p>

<p class='c011'>5½ M. <i>Castellum du Nador</i>, a late-Roman fortified country-seat
(3rd or 4th cent.), was originally a quadrangular walled enclosure
of 55 by 47 yds.; immediately to the left of the road there
now remain the ruins of two round corner-towers and of a handsome
gateway flanked with two square towers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>The road leads on to the watershed, from which one has a view
of the Atlas of Blida behind and the Dahra mountain spurs (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>)
in front. Thence it dips into the valley of the <i>Oued el-Hachem</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>9½ M. <i>Marabout Sidi-Ameur</i> (164 ft.), on the left bank of
the stream, at the junction of the Marengo road (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>About ¾ M. farther on we observe, on the left, the *<b>Cherchell
Aqueduct</b>, coming from the village of Marceau, the largest Roman
work of the kind in Algeria, which, rising in three tiers to a height
of over 100 ft., here bridges a side-valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing several hill-farms, owned by French families, the road
next turns to the N.W. into the valley of the <i>Oued Bellah</i>. Beyond
the (14 M.) <i>Café de l’Oasis</i> we pass under the aqueduct, of
which twenty pillars and five arches, built of great blocks of limestone,
are still standing here at the foot of the beautiful pine-wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the aqueduct begins the finest part of the road. At first
it skirts a pine-clad slope and then, leaving <i>Cap Blanc</i> to the
N. E., leads to the W., up and down hill, along the coast. Lastly
it passes the fissured <i>Cape Zizerin</i> and two saints’ tombs.</p>

W., at the foot of a range of low hills, through the plain of <i>Mitidja</i>,
which is here very monotonous. To the right, on the crest of the
Sahel, is the <i>Tombeau de la Chrétienne</i> (p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>); in front of us
rises <i>Jebel Chenoua</i> (p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>). We pass the two poor villages of
(3½ M.) <i>Ameur-el-Aïn</i>, and (8½ M.) <i>Bourkika</i> (345 ft.), where

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Road from Marengo to</span> (8 M.) <span class='sc'>Tipaza</span> (carr. 6–8 fr.) crosses
the Oued Meurad and intersects the fine *<i>Forêt de Sidi-Slîmân</i>
(‘Solomon’s Forest’), still primæval in character, with dense underwood
and luxuriant ivy climbing to the tops of the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the <i>Oued Nador</i>, near the (6 M.) <i>Gué du Nador</i>, our road
joins the Cherchell road (see p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>). At the (7 M.) <i>Ferme Trémaux</i>
it leaves the valley of the Nador, whose estuary is flanked with
low sand-hills, and leads to the E. to (8 M.) <i>Tipaza</i> (p. <a href='#Page_239'>239</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The highroad (carr. 12–15 fr.) from Marengo to (16 M.) <i>Cherchell</i> (see

and vines. The great Thursday market is well attended by the
Beni Menasser (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Zurich the train runs to the W. of the Cherchell highroad.
To the left lies the <i>Cherchell Aqueduct</i> (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>), while to

incl. 4700 Mohammedans), a pleasant little seaport, lies on a narrow
limestone plateau, an old coast-terrace, at the foot of green hills
(750–800 ft.). Behind these hills rises a mountainous region, once
well wooded, inhabited by the Berber tribe of the <i>Beni Menasser</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Cherchell occupies the site of the ancient Phœnician colony of <i>Iol</i>.
From the year 25 B. C. it took the name of <i>Caesarea</i>, and in the Roman
imperial age it became the capital of Mauretania and residence of Juba II.
(25 B. C. to 22 A. D.), one of the most learned and enlightened men of
his time, under whom it rapidly rose to importance. Under Emp. Claudius
it became the provincial capital, under the name of <i>Colonia Claudia
Caesarea</i>, of Mauretania Cæsariensis, and in rivalry with Carthage and
Hippo Regius (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>) grew to be one of the greatest and wealthiest cities
of N. Africa. After the erection of Mauretania Sitifensis (p. <a href='#Page_271'>271</a>) into a
new province the prosperity of Cæsarea began to wane. About 371 its
art and industry were almost annihilated by its capture and pillage by
the Donatists (p. <a href='#Page_172'>172</a>) under the Berber prince Firmus, and it lost the
last vestige of its ancient glory when the Vandals transferred their residence
to Carthage. In the 10th cent. the town is mentioned under the
name of <i>Cherchell</i>, but from the 11th cent. onwards it was entirely
deserted. At length, at the end of the 15th cent., it was revived by
Andalusian Moors, who brought with them their famed potter’s art. In
1516 it was occupied by Horuk Barbarossa (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), in 1531 it was unsuccessfully
attacked by Admiral Andrea Doria (p. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>), and lastly, after
being taken by the French, it was enclosed by a wall in 1843. As the
harbour affords but little shelter the town has now little or no trade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Archæologists may like to examine the scanty remains of the
<i>Roman Fortifications</i> (2735 by 1640 yds.), which extend over the
crest of the hill-range with its fine views; but the chief attraction
is the Museum of sculptures of the period of Juba II., which form
the only certain memorials of ancient Cæsarea, ‘an oasis of Greek
culture in the midst of the Berbers’.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>The <span class='sc'>Place Romaine</span> or <span class='sc'>Esplanade</span> forms the nucleus of the
little town. Among the trees here rises a <i>Marble Fountain</i>,
composed of Roman architectural fragments found in the environs,
remains perhaps of a palace of king Juba’s era (the four colossal
masks are copies; see below). The Corinthian column and fragments
of other columns at the back of the fountain were excavated
in the Roman theatre (p. <a href='#Page_246'>246</a>). The parapet of the Place Romaine
affords a survey of the harbour (p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the E. side of the Place Romaine rises the new *<b>Museum</b>,
which consists of four galleries enclosing a central court. Among
the sculptures exhibited here are admirable replicas of famous
Greek works of the archaic and of the culminating periods of
Greek art (5–4th cent.), which were executed by Greek masters for
the adornment of king Juba’s residence. Adm. at any time; the
custodian (½–1 fr.) shows also the Thermes de l’Ouest (see below).

<p class='c016'>Passing through the <span class='sc'>Entrance Room</span> (S.W. Pavilion; busts, statues,
etc.) we enter the—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Salle Berbrugger</span> (S. Gallery). 31. Marble statue of Venus; *1. Athena
(torso), a copy in marble of a famous bronze by <i>Alcamenes</i> (5th cent.);
46. Torso of a youth or Dionysus, probably after a marble statue of the
<i>School of Praxiteles</i>; 10, 13. Two torsos of Diana; 39 B. Female statue
with the attributes of Ceres; 33 B. Aphrodite (or Proserpine); several
draped female statues.—In the middle of this gallery are several marble
heads on brackets: *64. Apollo, after an archaic Attic original (early
5th cent.); 69. Juba II. as a youth; without number, Agrippina.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>South-East Pavilion.</span> On the walls, mosaics (hunting-scenes, three
Graces, etc.). In the centre, 11. Onyx statuette of Diana hunting; 109.
Egyptian basalt statue of a king Thutmosis; 23. Marble group of Pan and
a Satyr; 34. Venus.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Salle Jonnart</span> (E. Gallery) contains in glass-cases pottery, lamps,
bronzes, glass, coins, etc. In the middle, casts of statues found at Cherchell
but now in the Museum of Algiers.—We now cross the <span class='sc'>Central
Court</span>, with interesting architectural specimens, to the—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Salle Victor Waille</span> (W. Gallery). 19. Hercules, after an original
of the 5th cent.; *7. Dionysus; 19. Æsculapius, both after originals of the
4th cent.; *17G. Shepherd, replica of a work of <i>Praxiteles</i>; 21, 22. Two
torsos of Hermes; *47. Torso of a youth.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>North-West Pavilion.</span> In the middle, draped female statue (Muse?),
found in the theatre; numerous inscriptions; fragments of sculpture and

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Salle Cagnat</span> (N. Gallery). *39. Colossal female statue after a model
by <i>Phidias</i>; 37. Canephor (archaic); 38. Hermaphrodite and a Satyr
(Hellenistic). On the N. wall on brackets: Four colossal masks from
king Juba’s palace mentioned above (<i>Pergamenian School</i>; 1st cent.).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>North-East Pavilion.</span> Inscriptions; several objects of Punic origin.
In the centre, 68. Bust of Augustus; 49B. Muse.—Leaving this room by
a door in the N. wall we enter a—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Court</span> containing sarcophagi and numerous architectural fragments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving the Museum we cross the Place Romaine to its W. side,
where we follow the third side-street (from the N.) to the W.
and soon reach on the right, nearly opposite a little mosque, the
*<b>Thermes de l’Ouest</b> (W. Baths), dating from the 2nd or 3rd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>cent., the grandest Roman ruins in the town, with walls still rising
to a height of 10–13 ft. (concrete faced with brick) and bits of old
mosaic pavement. Most of the antiques in the museum were found
in these baths, in which they seem to have been collected in the
early-Christian period.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ancient <i>Portico</i>, on the E. side of the baths, once with granite
columns 26 ft. high, is now embedded in the building of the Manutention,
and on the S. side are several chambers hidden under the Prison Civile.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the present entrance on the S. E. side we first come to a suite
of five important chambers. The central hall, 26 by 16 yds., was probably
the <i>Frigidarium</i>, which was flanked on three sides with smaller basins
(piscinæ). The two narrow passages behind the S. and the N. basins
show traces of the stairs that once ascended to the upper story.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the W. side of the frigidarium is a room supposed to have been
the <i>Tepidarium</i>, which, like its side-rooms, is accessible only by climbing
over the walls. The hall behind the tepidarium, with its semicircular
niche, was apparently the <i>Caldarium</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Baths command a delightful view of the sea and of the coast to
the W., as far as Cape Ténès (p. <a href='#Page_209'>209</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>Proceeding from the Thermes de l’Ouest we take the side-street
at the mosque mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_245'>245</a> to the S. and reach the <span class='sc'>Rue de
Ténès</span>, the principal street of the town which leads to the W. (right)
to the Porte de Ténès (see below). We, however, turn to the E. (left)
and then follow the Rue du Centre, the first S. side-street. In the
first side-street of the last, on the right, is the entrance to the famous
old <span class='sc'>Chief Mosque</span> ‘of the hundred columns’, completed in 1573, now
the <i>Military Hospital</i>. Into the original ‘house of prayer’ a corridor
and four hospital dormitories have been built; the antique columns,
which are said to have been brought from the W. Baths, have been
disfigured by a coating of paint.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S. end of the Rue du Centre, on the right, is a brick
wall, the sole relic of the Roman <i>Thermes du Centre</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the left, on the hill-side above the Rue du Caire,
are the remains of the <i>Roman Theatre</i>, unearthed in 1905. The
E. side-entrance (parodos), between the stage and the auditorium,
still exists, but the 27 tiers of seats were used for building the
neighbouring barracks in 1845.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Barracks of the Tirailleurs</i>, on the hill above the theatre, stand
on six antique <i>Cisterns</i>, once fed by the Cherchell aqueduct (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>). Passing
through the Porte de Miliana, the S. gate behind the barracks, we
may now follow a path through the fields to the ruined walls of the
<i>Roman Circus</i>, once over 435 yds. long, which still lay within the ancient
town-walls.</p>

<p class='c022'>Outside the <i>Porte de Ténès</i> (comp. above), the W. town-gate, on the
old Gunugu (Gouraya) road, lay several <i>Roman Burial Grounds</i>. A collection
of objects unearthed here has been made by the commandant, <i>M.
Archambeau</i>, at his country-seat ½ M. from the gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Roman Theatre we follow the winding street to the
N. and reach the S. side of the Place Romaine at the <i>Catholic
Church</i>, built in the pseudo-classical style. In front of the high-altar
and at the end of the left aisle are two early-Christian mosaics.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>We may go down to the <b>Harbour</b>, either from the Place Romaine
or viâ the W. Baths (p. <a href='#Page_245'>245</a>), passing a large <i>Roman Basin</i> (piscina)
and a ruined <i>Turkish Fort</i> of Horuk Barbarossa (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The very shallow harbour, scarcely 5 acres in area, lying behind
the fortified <i>Ilot Joinville</i> with its lighthouse, is probably
identical with the <i>Roman Naval Harbour</i>, where part of the
Alexandrian and Syrian fleet was always stationed to defend the
coast against pirates. The short pier at the point of the lighthouse-island
and an old embankment on the cliffs on the E. side of the
bay protected the ancient <i>Commercial Harbour</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of the Place Romaine and the Porte d’Alger, at the
S.E. angle of the Champ de Manœuvres, are relics of the <i>Thermes
de l’Est</i> (E. Baths), including part of the chief hall, 22 by 13 yds.,
with two niches.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the highroad, 5 min. to the E. of the drilling-ground, a
short path to the right leads to the foundation walls of the <i>Roman
Amphitheatre</i>, overgrown with dense scrub. Since 1845 the ruins
have served as a quarry.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>36. From Algiers to Cape Matifou and to Aïn-Taya viâ Maison-Carrée.</h3>

<p class='c016'>20 M. <span class='sc'>Steam Tramway</span> (p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>), three trains daily (five on Sun. and

(p. <a href='#Page_249'>249</a>) to (4½ M.) <i>Aïn-Taya</i> twice daily, in 1 hr.—A pleasant drive
may be taken from Algiers to Aïn-Taya direct.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Steam Tramway</span> runs parallel with the railway through
the S. E. suburbs of Algiers (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>), past the <i>Jardin d’Essai</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>), and through the little town of <i>Hussein-Dey</i> (p. <a href='#Page_233'>233</a>), to
the railway-station of <i>Maison-Carrée</i> (p. <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>). It then crosses the
<i>Harrach</i> by a Turkish bridge of 1697.</p>

<p class='c011'>7½ M. <b>Maison-Carrée</b> (66 ft.; Hôt. du Roulage, Hôt. de
l’Harrach, both humble; pop. 7300, incl. 2700 Mohammedans and
3200 foreigners, mostly Spaniards), prettily situated on the right
bank of the Harrach, amidst hills rising some 200 ft. above the
stream, possesses an agricultural school and an interesting cattle-market
(Frid.). It owes its name to the square Turkish <i>Citadel</i>,
built in 1746, now the <i>Prison de l’Harrach</i>, used for native convicts.</p>

<p class='c016'>About 1¼ M. to the N. of Maison-Carrée, near the sea, lies the <i>Monastère
St. Joseph</i>, the headquarters of the <i>Missions d’Afrique</i> founded by
Card. Lavigerie (p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>), whose members owe their name of <i>White Fathers</i>
(Pères Blancs) to their white gowns Arabian in appearance. The monastery
owns an ethnographical collection from the interior of Africa.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Maison-Carrée the steam-tramway mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_219'>219</a> runs
across the Mitidja to (19 M.) <b>L’Arba</b> (335 ft.; Hôt. des Etrangers; Hôt.
de l’Arba), a small town of 2300 inhab., with an important Wednesday
market (Arabic arbáa), and then along the foot of the Atlas, partly through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>orange-groves, to (23 M.) <b>Rovigo</b> (361 ft.; Hôt. des Eaux-Thermales; Hôt.
du Commerce; pop. 4200, chiefly Mohammedan). This is the station for
(4½ M.) <i>Hammam-Melouan</i> (about 720 ft.), a small watering-place with
hot saline springs, chiefly patronized by natives, in the narrow ravine
of the <i>Harrach</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>A picturesque hill-road leads from L’Arba to (59 M.) <i>Aumale</i> (p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>;
diligence in 12 hrs.) viâ (14½ M.) <i>Sakamody</i> (2585 ft.), (47½ M.) <i>Bir-Rabalou</i>
(2106 ft.), and (50½ M.) <i>Les Trembles</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Matifou road ascends to the top of the hill-chain and leads
to the E. to the village of (10 M.) <i>Retour-de-la-Chasse</i> (75 ft.),
2 M. to the N.W. of railway-station Maison-Blanche (p. <a href='#Page_249'>249</a>), and
to (15½ M.) <i>Rouïba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_249'>249</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Steam Tramway</span> follows the direct road from Maison-Carrée
to the N.E. to (12 M.) <b>Fort-de-l’Eau</b> (16 ft.; Hôt.-Restaur. du
Casino, on the shore; Hôt. de la Plage and others, plain), a small
sea-bathing place with many villas and a fine beach. Fine view of
Algiers and the spurs of Mont Bouzaréah. The old Turkish coast-fort,
<i>Bordj el-Kifan</i>, of 1581, stormed by the Foreign Legion in
1833, is now the Caserne de Douaniers. The village, noted for its
banana-culture, is inhabited chiefly by ‘Mahonnais’ (p. <a href='#Page_233'>233</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the village we proceed to the N.E., a little inland from
the bay, which is now much choked with sand, through tame fields
and underwood, to the <i>Oued el-Hamiz</i>. Here we turn to the N.,
soon obtaining a view of the broad Bay of Algiers and the distant
Atlas of Blida, and traverse the extensive plateau of <i>Cape Matifou</i>
(236 ft.; Arabic <i>Râs Temendfus</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>17 M. <b>Matifou</b> (210 ft.), a poor village, lies about 1½ M. to
the E. of the site of the Roman town of <i>Rusguniae</i>, where, under
the dense brushwood, the remains of baths and the foundations of
an early-Christian basilica have been discovered. The church, originally
with nave and aisles, was rebuilt in the Byzantine period
with double aisles and a W. apse.</p>

<p class='c016'>The small <i>Harbour</i> beyond the village, where Emp. Charles V. embarked
the remnant of his army in 1541 (comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), is now a quarantine
station for vessels and a port for pilgrims (Mers el-Hadjadjeh). The
Mohammedans returning from Mecca, usually including many Moroccans,
have to spend several days here in the large <i>Lazaretto</i> built in 1884.</p>

<p class='c022'>Besides the <i>Bordj Temendfous</i>, the interesting old Turkish fort, there
are also on the peninsula the French <i>Fort d’Estrées</i>, a <i>Lighthouse</i> (207 ft.),
visible from 32 M., and a <i>Semaphore</i>. On the shore, where there are
traces of a breakwater, a large tunny-net (<i>madrague</i>) is set in summer.
The fishermen are mostly Corsicans and S. Italians from the villages of
<i>La Pérouse</i> and <i>Jean-Bart</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Matifou we skirt the E. margin of the peninsula, soon
sighting the fine coast of Great Kabylia as far as Cape Bengut
(p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>), and run to the S.E., past some Roman ruins, to the village
of <i>Aïn-Beïda</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>20 M. <b>Aïn-Taya</b> (131 ft.; Hôt. du Figuier, R. 2–4, B. ¾,

village, is inhabited chiefly by Spaniards. From the chief place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>a short avenue of plane-trees and palms leads to the N.E. to the
steep edge of the coast and the fine bathing-beach.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the S. margin of the plateau, on the highroad beyond
Aïn-Taya, we obtain a delightful *View of the E. Mitidja with its

<p class='c022'>The railway to Tizi-Ouzou forms the chief approach to <b>Great Kabylia</b>
or <i>Grande Kabylie</i>, for which the best season is April or May, when
the bare limestone peaks of the Jurjura (p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>) are still capped with
their winter snow, while the lower hills are clothed with the fresh verdure
of spring. Most travellers are satisfied with a visit to Fort-National and
Michelet and the drive across the Tirourda Pass (R. 39) but the long route
from Fort-National to Bougie viâ Azazga and Taourirt-Ighil (R. 40) also is
quite interesting. Beautiful coast scenery between Dellys and Tigzirt.
The ruins at the latter will interest archæologists. The hotel-charges are
everywhere disproportionate to the services rendered, and the cuisine is
generally indifferent. Fairly good quarters are to be found only at Tizi-Ouzou,
Tigzirt, Michelet, Azazga, and Taourirt-Ighil.</p>

<p class='c022'>The so-called <i>Kabyles</i> (from the Arabic <i>kebila</i>, tribe) consisted, as
far back as the Roman period, of five Berber tribes, united to form a
state with a democratic constitution. In their remote mountain villages
(<i>thaddart</i>) they successively repelled the attacks of the Romans, the Arabs,
and the Turks, and it was not till 1852–7 that the French after protracted
struggles succeeded in subduing them. During the Turkish period they
were called <i>Zuawas</i>, whence the modern French Zouaves derive their
name. Their language is a Berber dialect mingled with Latin and Arabic
words. The men in the over-peopled W. and S. regions often migrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>to the Algerian towns and even to foreign countries as hawkers (<i>iattaren</i>),
or to the Mitidja as harvest labourers. The women, who are unveiled
and often adorned with valuable trinkets, are seen to advantage at the
wells. Many of the girls have pretty faces and good figures.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Algiers to (34 M.) <i>Ménerville</i>, see pp. <a href='#Page_249'>249</a>, 250. To the
left of the train, halfway to Félix-Faure, is the so-called <i>Mausolée
de Blad-Guitoun</i>, the sadly dilapidated tomb, originally 33 ft. high,
of a Christian Berber prince (4th or 5th cent.), in the style of the
later Djedar (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>), but with an octagonal base. The interior,
like that of the Tombeau de la Chrétienne (p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>), contains a lion
in relief, a winding gallery, and a tomb-chamber. The pyramid
with its steps has disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>38 M. <i>Félix-Faure-Courbet.</i> From the village of Félix-Faure
(236 ft.), formerly called <i>Blad-Guitoun</i>, near the station, a road
(diligence twice daily) leads to the N. through the hilly Sahel to
(4½ M.) <i>Zaatra</i> and (5½ M.) <i>Courbet</i> (253 ft.), two villages chiefly
inhabited by settlers from Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p class='c016'>The road ends at (8¾ M.) <i>Port-aux-Poules</i> or <i>Mers el-Hadjadjeh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_248'>248</a>),
a decayed seaport on the site of the Roman <i>Rusubricari</i>, the ruins of
which have been almost entirely swept away by the waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train crosses the <i>Isser</i> by viaducts of 110 and 160 yds. in
length. 40½ M. <i>Les Issers</i> (82 ft.; Hôt. du Marché, Hôt. des

<i>Jebel Djinet</i>, the ‘frontier pillar’ of Great Kabylia, to (10 M.) the small
bay, opening towards the W., of <i>Mersa Djinet</i>, near <i>Cape Djinet</i> (164 ft.),
whose basalt-quarries have yielded paving-stones for Algiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train leaves the Isser and ascends to the E. in the valley
of the <i>Oued Chender</i> to (51 M.) <i>Haussonvillers</i> (492 ft.; Hôt. des
Postes), peopled by settlers from Alsace-Lorraine. We are now
carried over four viaducts, each over 100 ft. high, and through
tunnels on the N. slope of the finely-shaped <i>Beni Mekla</i> hills
(2920 ft.), down to the <i>Sebaou Valley</i>, the chief valley of Great

cuttings near Tléta (p. <a href='#Page_253'>253</a>), crosses the Bougdoura and runs to the W.
for a short time in the valley of the <i>Oued Aguergoun</i>, in view of the
fine S. slopes of the Beni Mekla Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_253'>253</a>). It then bends to the S.W.
into the pretty and secluded valley of the <i>Acif Tléta</i> or <i>Oued Kessari</i>,
which here intersects the lower hills and for a distance of 17 M. contains
not a single human habitation. The hill-sides, however, are carefully
cultivated by the neighbouring villagers, and are well planted with fig and
olive-trees, eucalypti, and cork-oaks. We then ascend a high plateau,
with a superb view of Jebel Haïzer (see above), to the village of (26 M.)
<b>Dra el-Mizan</b> (1525 ft.; Hôt. Bellevue, Hôt. du Commerce, both humble),
once famed for its textile fabrics, situated on the N.W. spurs of the
<i>Beni Smaïl Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>; 10 M. to the W. of Boghni; diligence). A picturesque

across the <i>Tizi el-Arba</i> (beyond this, another view of Jebel Haïzer), to
the rail. station of <i>Aomar-Dra el-Mizan</i> (p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The train next crosses the <i>Oued Sebt</i>, approaches the Sebaou
after a long bend to the N., and then ascends past the Alsatian village

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Light Railway to Dellys</span> (19½ M.; p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>) descends to
the N. from <i>Camp-du-Maréchal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_253'>253</a>) through the broad <i>Sebaou
Valley</i>, past unimportant stations; then, near the mouth of the
stream, it turns to the N.E., away from the highroad, and skirts
the coast, which is at first flat and sandy and afterwards bold, and
abrupt. To the left rises the lighthouse, famed for its view, on
<i>Cape Bengut</i> (207 ft.), a spur of <i>Jebel Ouamri</i> (1227 ft.), composed
partly of basalt and other eruptive rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now proceed to the E., at first through orchards and then
on an embankment 26 ft. high, on the brink of a grand abraded
terrace, 1 M. long, flanked with narrow perpendicular ledges of
sandstone. We then pass through a short tunnel under the ‘dagger-pointed’
<i>Cape Dellys</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>19½ M. <b>Dellys</b> (203 ft.; Hôt. de la Colonie; pop. 3000, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>whom 2000 are Mohammedans, mostly Berbers of the Arab type),
a quiet little seaport, the W. sea-gate of Great Kabylia, probably on
the site of the Roman <i>Cissi</i>, rises in terraces with luxuriant gardens
on the E. slope of Cape Dellys, at the end of which is a small lighthouse.
The deserted harbour is fairly protected against N. and
N.W. winds only; the unfinished works at the end of the headland
have been destroyed by the waves. Dellys offers little attraction
beyond the strikingly beautiful view, stretching as far as Cape
Tedlès (p. <a href='#Page_256'>256</a>). A few relics of Roman <i>Cisterns</i> and <i>Thermae</i> also
may be visited. The <i>Native Quarter</i> is very picturesque. The
<i>Ecole Nationale d’Apprentissage des Arts et Métiers</i>, numbering
many Kabyle pupils, was transferred hither from Fort-National
(p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>) in 1871.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Coast Road to Tigzirt</span> (16 M.; diligence, see p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>)
leads to the E. from Dellys, up and down hill, in many windings,
past small headlands and bays and the estuaries of torrents. At first
we observe isolated European settlements, but farther on we pass
through underwood and the fields and fig-groves of the Kabyle hill-folk.
The latter half of the route leads through remains of the <i>Forêt
de Mizrana</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>16 M. <b>Tigzirt</b> (66 ft.; Hôt. des Ruines-Romaines, plain; pop.
barely 200), a poor little agricultural village founded in 1888, with
a lively Wednesday market, occupies part of the site of the ancient
<i>Rusuccuru</i>. This, as the name indicates, was originally a Berber
settlement; it afterwards became a Phœnician seaport. In the late-Roman
period it vied with Saldæ (p. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>) as one of the most populous
places on this part of the coast, and under the Byzantines it was
still fairly prosperous.</p>

<p class='c011'>The village lies on a low coast-terrace behind <i>Cape Tigzirt</i>, a
small headland, running out to a storm-beaten rocky island, with
which in the Roman period it was connected by a quay. The
<i>Roman Town Wall</i> extended from one shore to the other, as did
also the shorter <i>Byzantine Wall</i>, which was nearer the promontory.
The new buildings erected by the Byzantines, now a mass of
ruins overgrown by bushes, superseded most of the Roman edifices
on the promontory. The sole relic of the latter is a small *<span class='sc'>Temple</span>
(14¾ by 7 yds.) of the time of Septimius Severus, of unusually
heavy and massive form, which, according to the inscription, was
dedicated to the genius of the municipium of Rusuccuru. The lofty
front-wall of the cella, borne by two columns, immediately adjoins
the small court of the temple without an intervening vestibule.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman ruins between the two town-walls, on the inland
side, have been mostly either destroyed or built over by the modern
villagers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most important of the old buildings at Rusuccuru is the
*<span class='sc'>Bishop’s Church</span>, situated close to the Roman town-wall in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>E. part of the village. Originally a columnar basilica, 44 by 23 yds.,
probably of the 5th cent., it is now a picturesque chaos of ruins,
with remains of the old mosaic pavement.</p>

<p class='c016'>The entrances were through the chief portal in the narrow W. vestibule
and by three smaller doorways in the wall of the façade, leading
into an inner vestibule built into the nave. There are still traces of the
two arcades of the nave, borne by clustered columns, all brought from
ancient buildings, which rested without bases on stone pedestals. The
rich plastic decoration of the imposts, with a touch of the Punic style,
is noteworthy. The galleries over the aisles, accessible by outside stairs
on the N.E. side only, were ruined by fire at an early period.</p>

<p class='c022'>On each side of the oldest altar-table at the end of the nave four
steps ascended to the choir-recess, where remains of the columns of the
later ciborium altar still exist. Two small doors led from the apse into
the sacristies, which were shut off from the aisles. The diaconicon, on
the left, was adjoined by the quatrefoil-shaped baptistery, also on the
left, containing fragments of the old font. The W. portal of the baptistery
led into a rectangular hall.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the late Byzantine period the E. half of the nave was walled off
for the use of the greatly reduced congregation, while the old aisles and
the sacristies were converted into burial-places.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few paces to the S. of the bishop’s church, above part of the
ancient Roman baths, are relics of a smaller early-Christian <i>Basilica</i>,
ending in a trilateral apse. Outside of the town lay the E.
burial-ground, with an early-Christian <i>Chapel</i> of similar design.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Tigzirt we may climb, 1 hr. to the N. E., through underwood, to
the Berber village of <b>Taksept</b>, on the crest of the abrupt <i>Cape Tedlès</i>
(870 ft.). Among the stone huts of the villagers are many fragments of
Roman buildings, hardly now recognizable, probably the ruins of <i>Iomnium</i>,
whose harbour lay on the E. side of the promontory. On the highest
point of the cape stands the chief landmark of this part of the coast,
the so-called <i>Phare</i> or <i>Mausolée de Taksept</i>, a late-Roman tomb, still
about 29 ft. high, with an octagonal substructure adorned with eight
Corinthian columns, above which probably once rose a step-pyramid.</p>

a carriage to the Tizi-Ouzou station if ordered by letter or telegram. Mules
also may be hired at Michelet (on Frid. they must be ordered in advance).
The Tirourda Pass is seldom fit for driving before the end of April.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Tizi-Ouzou</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>. The <span class='sc'>Fort-National Road</span> descends to
the E. into the valley of the Sebaou, where, at the bridge (259 ft.)
across its affluent <i>Oued Aïssi</i>, we enjoy a splendid *View of the
Jurjura Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>). It then branches off to the S.E., a little
before the village of <i>Sikh ou Meddour</i>, from the Azazga road on
the left bank (p. <a href='#Page_260'>260</a>), and begins to ascend rapidly to the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span><i>Massif de Fort-National</i>, the most important branch of the
*<b>Massif Kabyle</b>, which extends from the Sebaou to the base of
the Azerou-Tidjer (p. <a href='#Page_259'>259</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The road ascends in short windings, dangerous for motorists
descending, at one time following the S.W. slope of the hill above
the Oued Aïssi, where we have splendid mountain views, at another
running along the N.E. slope, above a second side-valley of the
Sebaou. On every side we see countless fig-trees, the favourite
fruit-trees of the natives. We pass isolated cottages and a few
small Kabyle villages (<i>Adeni</i>, <i>Tamâzirt</i>, and others), where the
curious may obtain access to one or other of the poor and uninviting
huts. Lastly, the road ascends by a long bend (cut off by a
mule-track) to the N. to the top of the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Fort-National</i> (3035 ft.; pop. 1000), in the territory of the
<i>Beni Raten</i> or <i>Iraten</i> tribe, was built in 1857, to overawe the
natives, on the site of a Kabyle village, and is now the capital of
the Massif Kabyle, with a busy Wednesday market, and like Michelet
(p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>), is a favourite centre for excursions. It consists of
little more than a single main street between the two town-gates.
Several shops contain Kabylian pottery and wood-carvings. The
trinkets sold here are often of Moroccan manufacture. The ‘cavalier’
or high bastion of the <i>Citadel</i> (3153 ft.; adm. only by leave
of the commandant) is a fine point of view, reached from the N.W.
town-gate by the short Rue Maréchal. A similar distant view is obtained
by walking round the <i>Town Walls</i> on the N.E. side, and
also from the Michelet road (p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> The best insight into the character of the people and
their land is afforded by the interesting, but rather fatiguing walk or
ride through the <b>Djemâa Valley</b> to <i>Michelet</i> (5–6 hrs.; mule 4–6 fr.;
path unfit for riding at places). We leave the road a few hundred paces
outside the S.E. gate of Fort-National, pass the large village of <i>Taourirt-Amokran</i>
(2424 ft.), the capital of the <i>Aït Ousammeur</i> tribe, a place
noted for its quaint old-fashioned pottery, and then descend abruptly to
the S. to the (1 hr.) <i>Djemâa Bridge</i> (about 1300 ft.). On the left bank
of the brook we ascend through the territory of the <i>Beni Yenni</i>, well
known for their various art-industries, to the village of <i>Aït-Larbâa</i>
(2166 ft.; mission-house of the White Fathers in the vicinity; p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>), and
then to the S.E. to (9½ M.) <i>Taourirt-Mimoun</i> (2435 ft.), whose white
school-house is conspicuous from a distance. The main track now leads
to the S.E. on the crest of the Beni Yenni Mts. viâ <i>Taourirt el-Hadjadj</i>
(2598 ft.) to <i>Tassaft ou Guemoun</i> (2545 ft.), and thence down steep zigzags
to <i>Souk el-Djemâa</i> (1477 ft.), where we reach the steep road ascending to
<i>Menguellet</i> (3350 ft.) and <i>Hôpital Ste. Eugénie</i> (p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>). Shorter, but often
impassable after rain, is the mule-track from Taourirt-Mimoun to the
(¾ hr.) <i>Djemâa Ford</i> (about 1395 ft.), and thence through a side-valley to
(1¼ hr.) Menguellet.</p>

<p class='c022'>To <b>Boghni</b> (8–9 hrs.; mule 8–10 fr.), a pleasant day’s excursion. From
Fort-National we first follow, to the S.W., the fine open road to the village
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>of <i>Aït-Atelli</i> (2648 ft.), and then descend viâ <i>Aït-Frah</i> (2126 ft.) to the
<i>Lowest Djemâa Ford</i> (about 900 ft.). Thence we follow the right bank
of the <i>Oued Aïssi</i> (p. <a href='#Page_256'>256</a>) and go through the side-valley of the <i>Acif
Djerra</i> to <i>Souk el-Haad</i> (about 1300 ft.), the chief market of the <i>Ouadhia</i>.
We then skirt the S. slope of <i>Jebel Iril ou Moula</i>, crowned with the village
of that name, and reach <i>Aïn-Sultan</i> (1313 ft.), a copious spring shaded
by huge nettle-trees (Celtis australis L.), 3¾ M. from <i>Boghni</i> (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Good climbers, properly equipped, may in the warmer season explore
some of the fine passes among the *<b>Jurjura</b> or <b>Djurdjura Mts.</b>, the
Roman <i>Mons Ferratus</i>, and ascend some of the higher peaks. Provisions
and guides necessary; night-quarters are obtainable at the school-houses.
<b>1.</b> To <i>Souk el-Haad</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a> and above; then viâ <i>Aït-Krelifa</i> (2230 ft.),
along the W. spurs of the <i>Chenacha Mts.</i>, and through the wild valley of
the <i>Beni Bou Addou</i> to the <i>Lac de Tizi-Koulmin</i>, one of the few mountain-lakes
in the Atlas. The lake lies at the foot of the pass (5813 ft.) of
that name, which separates the <i>Râs Tachgagalt</i> or <i>Pic Ficheur</i> (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>)
from the <i>Azerou-Ncennad</i> or <i>Pic de Galland</i> (7002 ft.), the westmost peak
of <i>Jebel Akouker</i>. From the pass we descend to the S.W. through remains
of a fine cedar-forest to <i>Bouïra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>).—<b>2.</b> From Fort-National viâ
<i>Taourirt-Amokran</i> (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>) to <i>Aït-Lahssen</i> (2851 ft.), the north-westmost
village of the Beni Yenni (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>); then viâ <i>Souk el-Arba</i> (1221 ft.), a
market-village in the valley of the <i>Acif el-Arba</i>, to <i>Aït-Touddeurt</i> (2271 ft.)
and <i>Taguemoun</i> (3852 ft.), on the S. slope of <i>Jebel Kouriet</i> (5027 ft.), one
of the Chenacha Mts. (see above); thence across three passes, the <i>Col de
Taguemoun</i> (3681 ft.), the <i>Tizi Guessig</i>, on the E. side of the <i>Azerou es-Guessig</i>,
one of the Akouker group, and the <i>Tizi Boulma</i> (5532 ft.), between
the Azerou-Ncennad (see above) and the <i>Râs Timedouine</i> (7563 ft.), the
highest peak of Jebel Akouker; thence down to <i>Bouïra</i>.—<b>3.</b> Viâ <i>Souk
el-Arba</i> (see above) to the village of <i>Tiroual</i> (2664 ft.), on the spurs of
the <i>Azerou ou Gougane</i> (7080 ft.) and <i>Azerou Thaltatt</i>; next across the
<i>Tizi n-Assoual</i> (5683 ft.) to <i>Ansor el-Akhal</i> or <i>Ansor Lekhal</i> (about 2950 ft.),
and through the valley of the <i>Oued Beurd</i> to <i>El-Adjiba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Road to Michelet</span> (29½ M.; diligence, see p. <a href='#Page_256'>256</a>), starting
from the S.E. gate of Fort-National, leads at first along the
S.W. slope of the Massif de Fort-National, soon affording a superb
*View of the Jurjura Mts., from Jebel Haïzer (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>), on the W.,
and from Jebel Akouker (see above) to the Lalla Khedidja (p. <a href='#Page_259'>259</a>).
To the right, in the valley, lies the village of Taourirt-Amokran
(p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>); opposite us, beyond the deep ravine of the Oued Djemâa
(see p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>), rise the Beni Yenni Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>About 4½ M. beyond Fort-National a rough road diverges to the left
to (20 min.) the small hill-village of <i>Icherridêne</i> (3494 ft.) and the <i>Monument
d’Icherridêne</i>, erected by the French in memory of the decisive
battles of 1857 and 1871. Near the pyramid we obtain a splendid distant
*View. We may descend to the highroad on the other side.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a short distance the road skirts the E. margin of the hills
and overlooks the hill-country of the <i>Aït Yahia</i>. It then ascends in
windings, passing near the villages of <i>Azerou-Kellat</i> and <i>Taskenfout</i>
on the right, to a height where the road to (20 min.) <i>Hôpital
Ste. Eugénie</i> and <i>Menguellet</i> (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>) branches off to the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>29½ M. <b>Michelet</b> (3543 ft.; Hôt. des Touristes or Calanchini,
R. 3–3½, B. 1–1½, déj. 3, D. 3½ fr., clean and quite good; mule
to the Tirourda Pass 4–5, to Tazmalt 6 fr.; pop. 200, chiefly French),
the capital of the <i>Canton du Djurdjura</i>, one of the most thickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>peopled districts in Algeria, is prettily situated, on the partly vine-clad
S.W. slope of the hills, with fine views all around.</p>

<p class='c016'>From (½ hr.) the crest of the hill (4042 ft.), to which a path ascends
to the left from the Hôtel des Touristes, we have an extensive *Panorama
of the neighbouring Jurjura Mts., among which the Lalla Khedidja (see
below) stands forth grandly, of the Massif Kabyle, the depression of the
Sebaou Valley, and the distant coast hills. The view is peculiarly impressive
in the early morning, when the snow-capped Jurjura and the green
lower hills with their countless Kabylian villages protrude like islands
from the sea of mist in the valleys.</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<b>Lalla Khedidja</b> (7572 ft.), the highest of the Jurjura Mts.,
may be ascended from Michelet by one of two different routes. One route
is viâ <i>Souk el-Djemâa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>), the hill-villages of <i>Aït-Saada</i> (3055 ft.)
and <i>Darna</i> (3314 ft.; night-quarters), and the passes <i>Tizi Tirkabin</i> (4587 ft.)
and <i>Tizi n-Kouïlal</i> (5178 ft.), near the sources of the <i>Oued el-Hammam</i>.
The other route is viâ the <i>Tirourda Pass</i> (p. <a href='#Page_260'>260</a>), the village of <i>Aït-Ouabane</i>
(about 3380 ft.), in the basin between the offshoots of the <i>Azerou
Tidjer</i> (see below) and the <i>Azerou Madène</i> (6401 ft.), and across the Tizi
n-Kouïlal, where the mules are left behind. The ascent is, however, easier
and shorter from Maillot (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>). A bridle-path leads thence to the
(4½ hrs.) village of <i>Tala Rana</i> (4508 ft.; night-quarters). Then 1 hr.
through cedar-forest (see p. <a href='#Page_210'>210</a>), and lastly an ascent on foot, over loose
stones, in 2 hrs. more to the top, where three ruinous stone huts afford
some shelter. The imposing view embraces the whole mountain region
of Great Kabylia, the main ranges of Little Kabylia (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>), the Sahel
valley (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>), the Chaîne des Biban (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>), and the extensive Hauts-Plateaux
(p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>). Early in the morning in clear weather we may descry,
with the aid of a telescope, the white houses of Algiers, while the sea
is visible in the direction of Bougie. In the height of summer, on seven
Thursdays, hundreds of the neighbouring Kabyles make this ascent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Michelet begins the finest part of the road, which now
rapidly nears the Jurjura range. After ½ hr. it skirts for a short
time the E. slope of the range, where a path to the left diverges to
the village of <i>Aït-Mellal</i>; then, returning to the W. slope, it passes
close below the villages of <i>Tifferdout</i> (3927 ft.) and <i>Tazerout</i>
(3884 ft.). The *View is particularly grand at a bend near the
53rd kilomètre-stone (33 M.), whence we observe a road-mender’s
house in the foreground, at the foot of the bare <i>Azerou Tidjer</i>
(5745 ft.), which conceals the Lalla Khedidja. Opposite, on the
hill beyond the head of the Oued Djemâa valley (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>), lie the
three large villages of the <i>Beni Akbil</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>35 M. <i>Maison Cantonnière</i> (4111 ft.; closed in winter). The
road soon crosses (7 min.) the narrow saddle between the lower hills
and the Azerou Tidjer, and is then carried along the abrupt E. slope
of the latter by means of numerous embankments, galleries, and
two short tunnels. On the left lies the deep-set <i>Tirourda Valley</i>,
enlivened by herds of cattle in summer, with the village of <i>Tirourda</i>
(about 3870 ft.), viâ which the pass may sometimes be reached
when the road is blocked with snow. Behind it rise the four bare
peaks of <i>Jebel Tizibert</i> (5754 ft.) and the pointed cone of the
<i>Azerou n-Tohor</i> (p. <a href='#Page_260'>260</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The road at length pierces the E. margin of the <i>Azerou n-Tirourda</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>(6437 ft.) by means of a cutting called the <i>Porte Civili</i>
after its engineer, and ascends in a curve to the pass.</p>

<p class='c011'>39½ M. <b>Col de Tirourda</b> (5775 ft.), the most frequented pass
in the Jurjura, where we have a striking view of the hills of the
Sahel valley, the Chaîne des Babors (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>), and Chaîne des Biban
(p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Most travellers are satisfied with the ascent of the slight hill on the
right of the road. The view is, however, much more extensive from the
<i>Azerou n-Tirourda</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_259'>259</a> and above), and still more so from the marabout
on the <i>Azerou n-Tohor</i> (6181 ft.), which may be scaled in ½ hr. from
the <i>Piste de Chellata</i>, the road to the <i>Col de Chellata</i> (4806 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The road descends from the pass in many windings into the
valley of the <i>Oued Aghbalou</i>, called <i>Oued Tixiriden</i> lower down,
and beyond the (44½ M.) <i>Maison Cantonnière d’Aïn-Zebda</i>
crosses to the right bank. The small villages of <i>Selloum</i> (about
2630 ft.) and <i>Tixiriden</i> (about 1970 ft.) lie a little to the right.
Near the 94th kilomètre-stone (58½ M.) we reach the road in the
valley, above the left bank of the Sahel, about halfway between
(65 M.) <i>Maillot</i> and (63½ M.) <i>Tazmalt</i> (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>). The direct descent
to Tazmalt by the bridle-path is preferable to the long drive round
by the road.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>40. From Fort-National viâ Azazga to Bougie.</h3>

<p class='c016'>77½ M. <span class='sc'>Road.</span> From Fort-National to Azazga 22 M. (no diligence); from

when hired to Azazga or Fort-National only are rather cheaper.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Azazga road between Fort-National and the Sebaou Valley is
hardly less attractive, especially in the reverse direction, than that between
Tizi-Ouzou and Fort-National, although lacking the mountain view.
Between Azazga and Bougie our route leads partly through the forests of
the Algerian Tell Atlas (cork-trees, evergreen oaks, etc.), now sadly thinned.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Fort-National</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>. The <span class='sc'>Azazga Road</span> branches to
the left from the Michelet road (R. 39) a few hundred yards from
the S.E. gate of the town, and leads through vineyards into the
picturesque valley of the <i>Oued Bou Aïmeur</i>, the deep incision
between the hills inhabited by the <i>Oumalou</i>, on the E., and the
<i>Aït-Akerma Mts.</i> on the W., on the crest of which stand a series
of five villages. Behind us is a fine view of Fort-National, which
remains in sight as far as (6¼ M.) <i>Fontaine-Fraîche</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road now runs on the E. slope of the hill, through fig-gardens
and olive-groves, soon in full view of the beautiful wooded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>valley of the <i>Oued Rabta</i> to the right, and descends in short
windings to the saddle between the Oumalou hills and the <i>Takorrabt
Bou Achbatzene</i> (981 ft.), crowned with a saint’s tomb. Sweeping
round to the W. our road next enters the featureless <i>Sebaou
Valley</i> (p. <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>), where it joins that on the left bank coming from
Tizi-Ouzou. A branch to <i>Mékla</i> diverges ½ M. farther on.</p>

<p class='c011'>About 5½ M. farther we cross the Sebaou and then pass through
a eucalyptus avenue to the Tizi-Ouzou and Azazga road on the right
bank, where we ascend rapidly through underwood and fields to—</p>

<p class='c011'>22 M. <b>Azazga</b> (1418 ft.; Hôt. Gebhardt, R. 3, B. 1½, déj. or
D. 3 fr.; Hôt. Vayssières, plainer, good cuisine; pop. largely Alsatian),
a large village on the N.W. spurs of the wooded <i>Jebel Bou
Hini</i> (3327 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The road ascends, soon affording a pleasant view as we look
back to the Sebaou plain, through beautiful woods in the territory
of the <i>Beni Ghobri</i>, to the saddle between Jebel Bou Hini on the
right and <i>Jebel Zraïb</i> (3061 ft.) on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>29½ M. <i>Yakouren</i> (about 2460 ft.; tavern), a small French
settlement, near the Kabyle village of that name. As we ascend to
the (35 M.) <i>Col de Tagma</i> (3094 ft.) we look back for the last time
to a great part of the Massif Kabyle (p. <a href='#Page_257'>257</a>) and the Jurjura Mts.
Beyond the pass we enter the <i>Province of Constantine</i> and descend
through oak-forest and underwood, and then through fields and
orchards, skirting for many miles the N. slope of the hills of the
<i>Forêt de Tizi Oufellah</i> (4285 ft.). The road runs high above the
valley of the <i>Oued el-Hammam</i>, where many Kabylian villages
are perched on hills or ensconced among rocks. These and the
small baths of <i>Acif el-Hammam</i> lie on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing at some distance from the <i>Forêt d’Akfadou</i>, the most
famous of the oak-forests of Great Kabylia, the road next skirts
the N. slope of <i>Jebel Toukra</i> (4806 ft.). Then, affording a distant
view of the fine hill-region of the <i>Oued Dahs</i> to the left, it passes
close to the large village of <i>K’Bouch</i> on a hill and approaches the
neglected oak-woods of the <i>Forêt de Taourirt-Ighil</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>50½ M. <i>Chalet de Taourirt-Ighil</i> (about 2950 ft.; rustic but
good, R. 2, déj. 3–4 fr.), a resort of sportsmen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beyond the hamlet of <i>Taourirt-Ighil</i> the old road descends to the S.E.,
in wide curves, overlooking on the right the valley of the <i>Fenaïa</i> and
the hills of the <i>Sahel Valley</i> (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>), to the (54 M.) <i>Col de Talmetz</i> (2703 ft.;
road-mender’s house). A little below the pass we survey the upper valley
of the <i>Oued el-Kseur</i> (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>). In the distance rises <i>Jebel Arbalou</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>). Besides oak-forest we pass also through beautiful underwood,
where the fragrant erica abounds, vying in spring with the macchia of
Corsica.</p>

<p class='c022'>Next to the forest-zone comes the fertile hill-region above the Sahel
valley, beyond which are seen the mountains of Little Kabylia (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>).
Passing several Kabylian villages, the road descends in many windings
to (64½ M.) the village of <i>El-Kseur</i> (295 ft.; Hôt. de l’Union, rustic).</p>

<p class='c022'>65 M. <i>El-Kseur-Amizour</i>, and thence to (80 M.) <i>Bougie</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>The new Bougie road reaches, on the S. slope of <i>Jebel ou
Chiouen</i> (3289 ft.), the upper valley of the <i>Oued el-Kseur</i>, a dull,
uninhabited forest region, and then nears the S. base of the bare
<i>Jebel Arbalou</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on, in the vale of the <i>Oued Rhir</i>, we cross the La
Réunion and Toudja road (p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Toudja</b> (650–1000 ft.) is a group of Kabylian villages in the abundantly
watered upper valley of the Oued Rhir and on the S.E. slope of
<i>Jebel Toudja</i> (1998 ft.), the E. spur of <i>Jebel Arbalou</i> (4291 ft.), the latter
of which may be scaled in 3–3½ hrs. Toudja is famed for its oranges. The
modern Bougie, like the ancient Saldæ (p. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>), is supplied with water
from the springs of Toudja. The <i>Roman Aqueduct</i> was 13 M. long; remains
of its pillars are still to be seen on the <i>Col d’El-Hanaïat</i> (about
1475 ft.), ½ hr. to the N.E. of Toudja.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lastly we descend into the vale of the <i>Oued Srir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>) and
reach (77½ M.) <i>Bougie</i> (see below).</p>

<p class='c009'>The quiet seaport-town of <i>Bougie</i> (pop. 11,000, of whom 6000
are Mohammedans and 600 Jews), defended by several forts, rises
in terraces on the W. shore of the bay of that name, at the S. base
of the steep <i>Jebel Gouraya</i> (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>). The <i>Anse de Bougie</i> or
<i>d’Abd el-Kader</i>, a small bay between two headlands, the <i>Kasba
Hill</i> to the W. and the <i>Bridja Hill</i> to the E., forms the harbour.
The so-called <i>Darsenâa</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>), the ancient Roman and Moorish
harbour adjoining the plain to the W. of the Kasba Hill, and near
the industrial suburb close to the station, is now choked with the
deposits of the Oued Sahel (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>). The upper part of the Kasba
Hill to the N., above the new French quarters, is the <i>Ville Indigène</i>
or Kabylian quarter (Pl. A, B, 1, 2), whose red-tiled stone huts
resemble those of the villages of Great Kabylia (p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>). A second
native quarter, the <i>Faubourg des Cinq-Fontaines</i> (Pl. B, C, 1),
lies in the upper part of the valley, between the two hills.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The environs of Bougie, owing to the copious winter rainfall
(p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>), are remarkable for their luxuriant vegetation and their
splendid timber. The town is most beautiful in spring, when the
gardens don their freshest verdure and the terraces and slopes are
gorgeously carpeted with bougainvilleas. In winter the blue bay
contrasts most picturesquely with the snow-clad mountains of Little
Kabylia (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Under the Carthaginians Bougie, like Igilgili (Djidjelli), was probably
one of the chief seaports on this part of the coast, but its Punic name
is unknown. In the Roman period, under the name of <i>Saldae</i>, it was
the principal town on the bay. Its present name (Ital. and Span. <i>Bugia</i>)
is derived from the Berber tribe of the <i>Bejaïa</i> or <i>Bujaïa</i>, who settled
in the vicinity in the 10th century. The town attained its brief prime in
the middle ages, and was one of the most flourishing of the minor Moorish
principalities when under the sway of the <i>Hammadites</i> (1090–1152), fugitives
from Kalàa des Beni-Hammad (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>). The Pisans, the Genoese,
and the Venetians had their factories here. Wax being the chief export,
the French still call their wax-candles <i>bougies</i> (originally, in Ital., candele
di Bugia). From the 15th cent. down to the French occupation, save
during the Spanish period (1510–55), when it afforded an asylum to Emp.
Charles V. on his retreat from Algeria (1541; comp. p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), it was a
notorious haunt of the barbaresque pirates. The recent improvement of
the harbour is expected to revive the ancient prosperity of the place.</p>

<p class='c009'>The finest mediæval building in the town is the dilapidated
<b>Porte Sarrasine</b> (Pl. C, 2; Arabic <i>Bâb el-Bahar</i>, sea-gate),
probably a relic of the town-walls erected by the governor En-Nasr,
in 1067, extending along the top of the two headlands, up
to the Plateau des Ruines (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Since the 16th cent. the bay has been commanded by the <i>Kasba</i>
(Pl. B, 3), a fortification of the Spanish period, and the ruinous
(originally Turkish?) <i>Fort Abd el-Kader</i> (Pl. D, 2, 3) on the rocky
summit of the Bridja Hill. Both are now barracks (no adm.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Harbour</b>, exposed to the infrequent N. and N.E. winds
only, one of the ‘least bad’ in Algeria, and now 65 acres in area,
was improved in 1905–9 by the extension of the <i>Jetée Abd el-Kader</i>
(Pl. D, 3; a fine point of view), by the formation of a quay
at the Pointe de la Kasba, and by the construction of the <i>Jetée du
Large</i>, an outer breakwater, 525 yds. long.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town is entered from the harbour either by the Boul. des
Cinq-Fontaines (Pl. C, 2, 1) or by the Rue de la Marine (Pl. C, 2)
and Rue Duvivier, all ascending to the Rue Trézel. From the
railway-station we ascend to the Place de l’Arsenal by the Rampe
of that name (Pl. A, B, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Rue Trézel</span> (Pl. B, C, 2), which ascends to the S.W. from
the lower ground to the Kasba Hill, is the only fairly animated street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>in the town. On the left is the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> (Pl. 2; C, 2), which
contains a few antiquities, including a Roman mosaic (Oceanus and
the Nereids) found near the hospital. The Fountain in front of the
Hôtel de Ville has a hexagonal column with a Roman inscription
in three parts recording the building of the aqueduct (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Place Gueydon</span> (Pl. B, 2, 3), the focus of traffic, named
after Admiral Gueydon (governor of Algeria, 1870–3), and adorned
with a <i>Monument</i> (a genius in bronze), affords a splendid *View
of the bay from the parapet.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Rue Trézel we cross the Place de l’Arsenal (Pl. B, 2)
and ascend the Rue Fatima to the booths of the <i>Kabylian Market</i>
and to the Kabylian quarter, the chief boast of which is the pretty
<i>Mosque</i> (Pl. A, B, 2), completed in 1902. Close by is the <i>Porte
Fouka</i> (Pl. A, 2), the substructions of which are ancient.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Fort Barral</i> (Pl. B, 2; formerly <i>Fort Moussa</i>), to the E. of
the Rue du Gouraya (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>), dates from the Spanish period. Behind
the Hôpital Civil are the <i>Citernes Romaines</i> (Pl. B, 1; 509 ft.),
which have been frequently altered. These and a few fragments
of the <i>Roman Town Walls</i> are the sole memorials of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rampe des Spahis (Pl. B, 2, 1) descends to the <i>Cinq-Fontaines</i>
(Pl. C, 1), a Mauro-Turkish fountain in the valley, whence
the Chemin de Bridja leads to the <i>Porte du Cimetière</i> (Pl. C, 1),
the town-gate on the Bridja Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>A charming walk is afforded by the road from the gate just
named, passing the <i>Jewish Burial Ground</i> (Pl. D, 1), and descending
in windings through olive and carob groves and ruins of old
fortifications, to the beautiful <b>Anse de Sidi-Yahia</b>. Thence, at
the lime-kiln and cement-works, we may either turn to the right
and go through the tunnel under Fort Abd el-Kader (p. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>) back
to the harbour, or we may follow the coast-road (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>) leading
to the E. to the bay of Les Aiguades.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Excursion to Cape Carbon</span> (there and back 3½–4 hrs.)
is best made on foot or by mule (3 fr., attendant 1 fr.). We leave
the town by the Porte du Cimetière and follow the rough road to
the N.E., passing (on the left) the <i>Catholic Cemetery</i> (Pl. C, D, 1),
and ascending amidst rich vegetation on the E. slope of <i>Jebel
Gouraya</i> (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the pleasant path which diverges to the Petit Phare
(482 ft.) on <i>Cape Bouak</i>, we soon reach the <i>Vallée des Singes</i>,
whence we look down on the peaceful <i>Anse des Aiguades</i> (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>),
and the (1 hr.) <i>Pic des Singes</i>, on whose steep rocky slopes we
may often see monkeys disporting themselves (comp. p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>). Just
beyond the short rock-tunnel, where the road ends, we obtain a
superb **View of <b>Cape Carbon</b> (722 ft.), whose limestone precipices,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>descending sheer on every side, are crowned with a semaphore
and the old lighthouse. We cross the low saddle between
the <i>Anse des Salines</i> (see below) on the left and the bay bounded
by Cape Carbon and the Cape Noir (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>) on the right, and ascend
past the <i>Old Lighthouse</i> to the (20 min.) *<i>Semaphore</i>, from whose
flat roof we have a splendid survey of the bay and of the bold coast
of Great Kabylia as far as the <i>Ile Pisan</i> (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the saddle just mentioned a path descends to the <i>New
Lighthouse</i> at the foot of Cape Carbon.</p>

<p class='c016'>The beautiful new *<span class='sc'>Coast Road</span> leads round the <i>Anse de Sidi-Yahia</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_264'>264</a>), passing the marabout of that name and the large quarries and
skirting the abrupt slopes of <i>Cape Bouak</i> (p. <a href='#Page_264'>264</a>). It pierces the point of
the cape by means of a short tunnel, and ends, beyond the old pumping-works,
at the *<b>Anse des Aiguades</b>. Its extension to the new lighthouse
at Cape Carbon is projected.—When the sea is calm we may row
from the harbour of Bougie (4–5 fr.; bargain necessary), past Cape Bouak
and through the <i>Roche Percée</i> at Cape Carbon, to the <i>Anse</i> and the <i>Pointe
des Salines</i>, with the <i>Grotte Ste. Anne</i>. On the return we may for
variety land in the Anse des Aiguades and walk back to Bougie by the
coast-road.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ascent of <b>Jebel Gouraya</b> (2166 ft.) takes 2–2½ hrs. on
foot or 1¾ hr. by mule (3 fr., and fee of 1 fr.). We first follow
the Rue du Gouraya and Chemin du Gouraya, or else a road on the
Bridja Hill above the <i>Faubourg des Cinq-Fontaines</i>, to the Porte
du Grand Ravin (Pl. B, 1). A steep road ascends thence in windings,
through underwood, to the <i>Plateau des Ruines</i>, where there
is a <i>Pénitencier</i> for military convicts. Hence a path leads in
½ hr. to the small <i>Fort du Gouraya</i>, within which is the shrine
of <i>Lalla Gouraya</i>. We then ascend to the right, round the fort,
to the cairn on the W. peak, where we are rewarded with a charming
view of the bay, the lower Sahel valley, the coast of Great
Kabylia as far as Cape Sigli (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>), and Jebel Arbalou (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Excursion to <i>Toudja</i> (carr. 20–30 fr.), and drive viâ Taourirt-Ighil to
<i>Azazga</i> (and Fort-National), see pp. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>, 261.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>42. From Bougie through the Chabet el-Akra to Sétif.</h3>

<p class='c016'>72 M. <span class='sc'>Road.</span> Motor-omnibus (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>) from Bougie at 6 a.m., in 7½

the rate of 10 fr. per 100 kilos (220 lbs.) for every 100 kilomètres (62 M.).
Also a diligence to Kerrata, both from Bougie and from Sétif: from
Bougie at 3.30 a.m., in 7½ hrs., from Sétif, at 5 a.m., in 6 hrs. (allowing
an hour for lunch at Kerrata, 11–12); fare for the whole journey
15 fr. (intérieur 8 fr.). Those who do not care for the unattractive drive
from Kerrata to Sétif, where there is direct correspondence in the
direction of Constantine and Biskra only, or who are bound for Djidjelli,
will return at once from Kerrata to Bougie.—Private carr. from one of
the hirers at Bougie (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>) to Sétif about 100–140 fr. (or to Kerrata and
back 50–60 fr.). Motor-car at Vogelweith’s (p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>) ½ fr. per kilomètre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Carr. from Sétif to Bougie 120, half-open (calaffe) 100 fr.; it is possible
to drive all the way in one day, but in the reverse direction (Bougie
to Sétif) it is best to spend a night at Oued-Marsa or Kerrata.</p>

<p class='c022'>The road skirts the gulf of Bougie (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>) all the way to the deep
depression of the Agrioun Valley. Between Bougie and Kerrata it passes
through the finest scenery of <b>Little Kabylia</b> or <i>Petite Kabylie</i>, a wooded
hill-region, thinly peopled by Berber tribes. The <i>Chaîne des Babors</i>, the
higher mountains, unlike those of the Jurjura (p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>), rise but little over
the intermediate hills. The <i>Chabet el-Akra</i> is the grandest mountain-defile
in Algeria.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Bougie</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_262'>262</a>. The <span class='sc'>Road</span> leads through the suburb at
the station and then to the S.W. across the plain of the <i>Oued Srir</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing through the featureless plain on the right bank of the
<i>Oued Sahel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>), we obtain retrospects, growing finer as we
advance, of Bougie and Cape Bouak and then of Cape Noir and
Cape Carbon also. We soon reach the vine-clad coast-plain on the
verge of the wooded hills of <i>Little Kabylia</i>, where the cork-oak
abounds, and for a time turn away from the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Halfway between Bougie and Cape Aokas the coast-plain narrows.
High above the rocky shore the road mounts a spur of the
<i>Beni Mimoun Djoua Mts.</i>, and then the (10½ M.) <i>Pointe Tichi</i>,
an offshoot of the <i>Beni Amrous</i> hills, beyond which it descends, in
view of the picturesque Cape Aokas and the coast as far as Cape
Cavallo (p. <a href='#Page_267'>267</a>), into the vine-clad valley of the <i>Oued Djemâa</i>.
At the (12½ M.) bridge over the stony bed of the stream, we observe
up the valley the <i>Beni Slimane Mts.</i> (4160 ft.) and those
of <i>Beni Bou Aïssi</i>, with the lofty <i>Jebel Imoulentaour</i> (5715 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the Djemâa valley begins one of the finest parts of the
coast. The hills again come down close to the shore. The road
passes the handsome <i>Villa Poizat</i>, with its great wine-cellars, and
crosses the wild <i>Oued Zitoun</i>. On the slope above the torrent is
a pretty farm-dwelling, nestling among eucalypti, bananas, and
bamboos. We next round the <i>Cône d’Aokas</i> (1519 ft.), precipitous
all round, and come to a bend in the road at (15 M.) <i>Cape Aokas</i>,
where we have a beautiful *View of the whole bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just before the village of <i>Oued-Marsa</i>, 6 min. beyond the
cape, is the prettily situated little <i>Hôt. du Cap Aokas</i> (R. 2½–3,
B. 1, déj. or D. 3½ fr., quite good). The road now enters the broad
coast-plain between the <i>Oued Marsa</i> and the Oued Agrioun, lately
brought under cultivation, overlooked by the <i>Beni Hassain Mts.</i>
(4567 ft.), and still showing a few vestiges of the primæval <i>Forêt
d’Acherit</i>, a swampy region notorious for malaria.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cross the <i>Oued Sidi Réhane</i> and pass the village of that
name, with its kubba shaded by venerable trees. A double tunnel
under the bed of the torrential <i>Oued Sidi Resgoun</i> next brings us
to the broad mouth of the <i>Oued Agrioun</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>22 M. <i>Souk et-Tenine</i> (Hôt. des Voyageurs, déj. 1½ fr., poor),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the Monday market of the Beni Hassain, lies on a low hill at the
entrance to the Agrioun valley. The road ascends on the left bank
of the valley, flanked with cork-trees and beautiful underwood.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road to <i>Djidjelli</i> diverges at the 36th kilomètre-stone
(22½ M.) to the left from the Sétif road.</p>

<p class='c016'>The beautiful <span class='sc'>Djidjelli Road</span> (from Bougie 60 M.; motor-omnibus
daily, fare 14 fr. 30 or 10 fr. 30 c.; diligence daily at 5 a.m., in the reverse
direction at 4 a.m., in 12 hrs., fare 10 or 7 fr.; provisions should be taken
for the journey) continues to skirt the bay of Bougie, passing at places
through fine old forest of cork-trees, pines, etc., thickly overgrown with
creepers. It crosses the Oued Agrioun beyond the 36th kilomètre-stone
and the <i>Oued Boulzazène</i>, and then returns, to the N.E., to the coast.</p>

<p class='c022'>Near the 42nd kilomètre-stone (26 M.) begin the *<i>Grandes Falaises</i>, a
series of bold cliffs, extending along the coast for 1¼ M., through which
the road is tunnelled at places. Fine view of the bay behind us, as far
as Jebel Gouraya. We next skirt two secluded bays, separated by <i>Jebel
Afoerer</i> (473 ft.), pass the <i>Pointe Ziama</i> (450 ft.), and cross the <i>Oued
Ziama</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>32 M. <i>Ziama</i> consists of a group of settlers’ dwellings near the
site of <i>Choba</i>, a Roman seaport, where there are still considerable remains
of the Roman town-walls, of baths dating from 196 A. D., and of the
Byzantine ramparts.</p>

<p class='c022'>Beyond the cliffs of <i>Pointe Mansouria</i> (hotel), off which rises the rocky
islet of that name, we come to (37½ M.) the mouth of the <i>Oued Guelil</i>
or <i>Dar el-Oued</i>, near the stalactite <i>Grottes de Mansouria</i> or <i>de Dar el-Oued</i>,
discovered in 1901. The chief grotto, 165 yds. long and 16 ft. high,
is lighted with acetylene (adm. 1 fr.).</p>

<p class='c022'>Passing several caverns on the coast, we next skirt the small <i>Anse de
Taza</i>, at the mouth of the <i>Oued Taza</i>, which, farther up, has carved out
a grand defile through the S. margin of <i>Jebel Taounnart</i> (2546 ft.). Partly
through cuttings and tunnels, the road now leads to (47½ M.) the village
of <i>Cavallo</i>, near <i>Cape Cavallo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>), the E. limit of the bay of Bougie.
Near it are large granite-quarries.</p>

<p class='c022'>Off the rocky coast lie on the left the islets of <i>Grand</i> and <i>Petit
Cavallo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>). 50½ M. <i>Montaigne</i> or <i>Agadie</i> is the only European
settlement on this part of the coast. A little beyond the <i>Oued Kissir</i> a
road diverges to the left to the lighthouse on the <i>Râs Afla</i> (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>). Our
road skirts the wooded flanks of <i>Jebel Mes Ritan</i> or <i>Mezritane</i> (1294 ft.),
and at the <i>Anse el-Kalâa</i> sweeps round to the S., inland. Lastly, passing
the small <i>Anse des Beni-Caïd</i> (see below), it reaches the Porte de Bougie,
the W. gate of—</p>

<p class='c022'>60 M. <b>Djidjelli</b> (Café de France, R. 2 fr., déj. or D. 2 fr., quite good;
pop. 6400, incl. 5000 Mohammedans), a poor seaport, consisting mainly of
two streets planted with fine plane-trees. This was the ancient <i>Igilgili</i>,
once an important mart of the Carthaginians, which in the middle ages
long retained its trade as the seat of a Genoese factory, but after its
occupation by Horuk Barbarossa (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) became a mere den of pirates.
The small <i>Harbour</i>, open towards the E., and inadequately sheltered on
the N. and N.E. sides, admits lighters and fishing-boats only. On the
adjacent <i>Crique de l’Ouest</i> rise the <i>Citadel</i> and the <i>Poudrière</i>, an old
fort. At the <i>Vigie</i>, the clock-tower on the neighbouring aloe-clad hill,
we enjoy a charming view of the hill-region around, noted in spring for
its gorgeous wealth of flowers, backed by <i>Jebel Sedderts</i> (3153 ft.) to the
E. and by the inland hills of Little Kabylia. To the W. of the town,
particularly on the headland between the Anse des Beni-Caïd and the
Anse el-Kalâa (see above), are many <i>Punic Rock Tombs</i>, now empty.</p>

<p class='c022'>A highroad leads from Djidjelli to (42½ M.) <i>El-Milia</i>, (84½ M.) <i>Collo</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>), and (95½ M.) <i>Robertville</i> (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>; motor-omnibus in 10 hrs., fare

well-preserved Byzantine town-wall), to (102½ M.) <i>Constantine</i> (p. <a href='#Page_297'>297</a>).—Railway
viâ El-Milia and Mila to Constantine projected.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Sétif Road</span> ascends gradually to the S., on the left bank
of the wooded Agrioun valley, at the E. base of the hills of the
Beni Hassain (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>). On the opposite bank, on the slope of the
finely shaped <i>Jebel Beni Bou Youssef</i> (3061 ft.), runs the new
mineral railway of Tadergount (see below). 25 M. <i>Aux Deux-Fontaines</i>
(about 410 ft.; inn).</p>

<p class='c011'>The road ascends more steeply, high above the river-bed. At
a bend just before the 43rd kilomètre-stone we have a splendid
survey of the central Agrioun valley, enclosed in a semicircle by
the lofty and barren crests of the <i>Chaîne des Babors</i>. The road
then descends to the S.W. into the valley again. To the left we
look into the lateral valley of the <i>Oued Tiraz</i>, with the iron-glance
mines of <i>Tadergount</i>, on the slope of <i>Jebel Beni Felkaï</i> (4452 ft.).
Wild oleanders abound in the bed of the Agrioun. On the wayside
are several Kabylian huts with orange and fig-gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the 49th kilomètre-stone we see, high above us, on the
right, <i>Beni-Ismaïl</i> or <i>Smaïl</i>, a mission-house of the White Fathers
(p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>) called after the tribe of that name, placed near a waterfall
between Jebel Imoulentaour (p. <a href='#Page_266'>266</a>) and <i>Jebel Takoucht</i> (6221 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the 50th kilomètre-stone (31 M.) two massive pillars of
rock mark the lower end (about 590 ft.) of the **<b>Chabet el-Akra</b>,
the grand ‘ravine of death’ (4½ M. long), between the bold and partly
bush-clad Jurassic rocks of Jebel Takoucht, on the W., and <i>Jebel
Adrar Amellal</i> (5817 ft.) and <i>Kef Randek</i>, on the E. An inscription
on the rock to the right records the construction of the extremely
costly road (1863–70). Monkeys (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>) are sometimes seen on
the hill-sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the 54th kilomètre-stone (33½ M.) the road crosses the
stream, which dashes over huge rocks far below the bridge, whence
we have a fine view down the valley. About ½ M. farther the valley
again contracts to a narrow defile. An inscription on a slab of
rock in the bed of the stream recalls the first march of French
troops through the gorge (1864). In the foreground rises a great
rocky cone called the *<i>Pain de Sucre</i> (Arabic <i>Drâ-Kalawi</i>),
apparently closing the valley. Passing some strange rock-dislocations,
with vertical strata, we reach (35½ M.) the upper end of
the gorge.</p>

<p class='c011'>37½ M. <b>Kerrata</b> (1575 ft.; Hôt. du Chabet, R., déj., D., each
2½–4 fr., very fair; Hôt. de Kerrata, humble; Tues. market), a
village of the <i>Beni Meraï</i> tribe, lies in a bleak hill-plain, adjoining
the stony S. slope of the Chaîne des Babors.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>From Kerrata viâ Aïn-Abessa to Sétif</span>, 34 M., pleasanter, by carr.
or cycle, than the main road viâ El-Ouricia, particularly in the reverse
direction. This road leaves the highroad near (3¾ M.) the mouth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><i>Oued Atteba</i>, one of the sources of the Agrioun, ascends its valley, and
crosses a pass to (17½ M.) <i>Aïn-Talaouart</i>. Here to the right diverges
the so-called Route des Caravansérails to the little town of <i>Aïn-Roua</i>
(3806 ft.), at the foot of <i>Jebel Anini</i> (5243 ft.), noted for its mineral
wealth, and to the sulphur-baths of <i>Hammam-Guergour</i> or <i>Sidi el-Djoudi</i>,
in the <i>Massif de Guergour</i>, which were already known to the Romans.
From Aïn-Talaouart our road turns to the S.E. and ascends past the
(20½ M.) village of <i>Aïn-Abessa</i> (3616 ft.; Hôt. Copel) to the saddle (4019 ft.)
between <i>Jebel Megriss</i> (5700 ft.) and <i>Jebel Matrona</i> (4679 ft.). Descending
to the <i>Oued Bou Sellam</i> (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>) the road here rejoins, a little before
(30 M.) <i>Fermatou</i> (see below), the main road to (34 M.) Sétif.</p>

<p class='c009'>The highroad ascends out of the Agrioun valley, soon offering
a glimpse of <i>Jebel Babor</i> (6575 ft.) on the left, and mounts in
windings, to the S.E., through a once wooded hill-region to the
(48 M.) <i>Tizi N’Béchar</i> (2910 ft.), 1¼ M. below the large Berber
village of <i>Takitount</i> (3448 ft.), and 2 M. to the W. of <i>Aïn el-Hamda</i>,
a village noted for its mineral water, known as ‘eau de Takitount’.
We descend from the pass to (52½ M.) <i>Amoucha</i> (Hôt. des Voyageurs,
déj. 3½ fr.), in the upper valley of the Agrioun.</p>

<p class='c016'>A road leads to the S.E. from Amoucha to (7½ M.) <b>Périgotville</b>,
the chief village in the Canton de Takitount, on the <i>Oued Aïn-Kebira</i>.
It lies on the site of the small Roman town of <i>Satafis</i>. The school-yard
contains a few antiquities. Diligence viâ <i>El-Ouricia</i> (see below) to <i>Sétif</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_271'>271</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>As the road ascends we have another view of Jebel Babor. It
winds up to the S. to the (59½ M.) <i>Teniet et-Tine</i> (3806 ft.), a
pass on the N. margin of the plateau of Sétif (p. <a href='#Page_271'>271</a>) commanding
fine views, and then descends to (64½ M.) <i>El-Ouricia</i> (3543 ft.),
a village near the head of the <i>Oued Bou Sellam</i> valley (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>),
with a few vineyards. 68 M. <i>Fermatou</i>, at the mouth of the brook

hrs. (fares 51 fr. 95, 37 fr. 10, 27 fr. 85 c.), one in the morning (with
dining-car), the other in the evening (sleeping-berth 15 fr. extra). <i>El-Guerrah</i>
is the junction for Biskra (R. 44); <i>Le Khroub</i> for Bona (R. 48)
and Souk-Ahras (and Tunis; RR. 49, 51). Railway Restaurants at Bouïra,
Beni-Mansour, Sétif, El-Guerrah, and Le Khroub.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Algiers to (107 M.) <i>Beni-Mansour</i>, see R. 37. The train
now leaves the Sahel valley (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>), enters, to the S., the valley
of the <i>Oued Mahrir</i>, and passes through a series of gorges flanked
with blackish limestone rocks, between the hills of the <i>Beni Abbès</i>
on the left and the <i>Beni Mansour</i> on the right, here almost uninhabited.
To the left we have a final glimpse of the Jurjura range
(p. <a href='#Page_258'>258</a>) behind us.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>115 M. <i>Les Portes-de-Fer</i>, the first station in the province of
Constantine, with a Sunday market, lies at the entrance of the two
passes over the <i>Chaîne des Biban</i> (pl. of <i>bâb</i>, gate) or <i>Chabet es-Sétif</i>.
These are the *<i>Grande-Porte</i> (Arabic <i>Bâb el-Kebîr</i>),
through which flows the <i>Oued Chebba</i>, the main branch of the Oued
Mahrir, and the <i>Petite-Porte</i> (<i>Bâb es-Serîr</i>), the ravine of its tributary
the <i>Oued Bou-Ketoun</i>. The train runs through the former
of these passes, a grand defile, where the rocks are curiously
stratified.</p>

<p class='c011'>125 M. <i>Mzita</i> (1811 ft.) lies in a bleak plain on the S. margin
of the Chaîne des Biban. The train now ascends rapidly to the S.E.,
between <i>Jebel Mzita</i> (4813 ft.) on the left and <i>Jebel Kteuf</i> (6109 ft.)
on the right, to (130 M.) <i>Mansoura</i> (2297 ft.), a village of immigrant
peasants, with a sulphur-spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the Chebba valley, we next pass, to the E., through a
tunnel of 2405 yds. (5 min.) into the <i>Medjana</i>, a lofty and unattractive
plain on the N. borders of the <i>Monts du Hodna</i> (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>149 M. <b>Bordj-Bou-Arréridj</b> (3002 ft.; Hôt. des Voyageurs,
unpretentious; pop. 3500, incl. many Alsatian settlers; Wed.
market), a small town adjoined by a large Berber village.</p>

<p class='c016'>This is the best starting-point for the highly attractive <span class='sc'>Tour to Bou-Saâda</span>,
which vies in interest with the excursions to Figuig (p. <a href='#Page_204'>204</a>),
Ghardaïa (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>), and Biskra (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>). The road (78 M.; diligence at 4.30 a.m.,
in 17 hrs.; fare 10 fr. 10 or 6 fr. 60 c.; returning from Bou-Sâada at 5 p.m.)
turns to the S. into the valley of the <i>Oued Ksob</i>, flanked on the W. and
E. by <i>Jebel Gourin</i> (3400 ft.) and <i>Jebel Mâadid</i> (6112 ft.). The stream,
having forced a passage through the <i>Monts du Hodna</i>, the N. borders of the
lofty steppe, where phosphates abound, is afterwards called <i>Oued M’Sila</i>
and falls into the Chott el-Hodna (see below). In the E. side-valley of the
<i>Oued Oucedjiit</i>, 2 M. off the road, and 8 M. from Bordj-Bou-Arréridj, lies
<i>Lecourbe</i> or <i>Ouled-Agla</i>, with scanty vestiges of the Roman <i>Equizetum</i> (?).
On the S. edge of Jebel Mâadid, about 9½ M. to the E. of the road, or
reached from Bordj-Bou-Arréridj by diligence viâ (19 M.) <i>Bordj-R’dir</i>
(very poor inn), lie the extensive ruins (palaces, minaret, etc.) of the
Berber town of <i>Kalâa des Beni-Hammad</i>, the residence of the Hammadites
in 1001–90 (p. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>At (36 M.) the little town of <i>M’Sila</i> (1539 ft.; Hôt. Duhoux, Hôt.
Reyre, both poor) we reach the <i>Plaine du Hodna</i>, a vast steppe, very hot
in summer, notable for its abundance of game and the thousands of camels
which browse on the extensive pastures. We cross several river-beds,
where curious rose-shaped crystals, ‘roses of the desert’, are often found,
and descend gradually past several artesian wells to the S.E. to the <i>Chott
el-Hodna</i> (1312 ft.), a vast salt-lake, 44 M. long and 12½ M. broad at its
widest part, whose swampy shores are enlivened by countless water-fowl.
Between this lake and Bou-Saâda we pass several shifting sand-hills.</p>

the chief scene of the ‘lettres familières’ of Col. Pein (p. <a href='#Page_175'>175</a>) and for
ages a favourite resort of French painters of Oriental subjects, is most
charmingly grouped round the Kasba hill (a fine point of view). The
dates of its little *Palm Oasis rival those of the Sahara. Busy Monday
and Tuesday markets.</p>

<p class='c022'>An important caravan-route (69½ M.; diligence every other day in
15 hrs.; 12 or 10 fr.; provisions necessary) connects Bou-Saâda with <i>Djelfa</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>(p. <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>). To the E. of the road, 9½ M. to the S. of Bou-Saâda, on the
Oued Bou-Saâda, lies the zaouïa of <i>El-Hamel</i>, a famous seminary for
priests, where good quarters are obtainable.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Bou-Saâda to <i>Aumale</i>, see pp. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>, 250.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train now turns to the S.E., in view of the Hodna Mts.
(p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>) to the right, crosses several affluents of the <i>Oued Ksob</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>), and passes unimportant stations.</p>

<p class='c011'>164 M. <i>Aïn-Tassera</i> (3395 ft.). Thence to the N.E. to (168 M.)
<i>Tixter-Tocqueville</i>, the station for <i>Tocqueville</i> (Arabic <i>Râs el-Oued</i>),
8½ M. to the S., the ancient Roman <i>Thamalla</i>, with remains
of a Byzantine fortress, and beds of phosphate near it.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the left, farther on, we have a view of the <i>Massif de Guergour</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_269'>269</a>), usually snow-clad in winter. We then enter the valley
of the <i>Oued Bou Sellam</i> (p. <a href='#Page_251'>251</a>). 176½ M. <i>Hammam</i>;

<p class='c009'><i>Sétif</i> (3596 ft.; pop. 21,790, incl. 7800 Mohammedans and
1800 Jews), on one of the highest sites in Algeria, stands on a slight
eminence to the N.W. of the station. It was the <i>Sitifis</i> of the
Romans, which became the capital of the new province of <i>Mauretania
Sitifensis</i> in 297 (comp. p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>), but after the irruption of
the Arabs it lost all importance. Horse-breeding is one of the chief
resources of the natives, and the horse-races are famous.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the suburb near the station we enter the town through the
Porte de Constantine. Near the Porte d’Alger, in the Place Nationale,
adorned with a fountain, rise the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> and the new
<i>Mosque</i>. In the <i>Jardin d’Orléans</i>, outside the Porte d’Alger, are a
few Roman antiquities (altars, tombstones, etc.). The old Byzantine
fortress with its eleven towers, to the N. of the town, has been converted
into the <i>Quartier Militaire</i>. Outside the Porte de Biskra,
where the Marché Arabe is held daily, lies a large <i>Berber Village</i>
with thatched houses.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the old Roman road to Saldæ (Bougie), which runs past the E.
side of the Jardin d’Orléans (see above), about 1 M. to the N.W. of the
town, rises the <i>Mausolée de Sétif</i> (popularly called Tombeau de Scipion),
a rectangular edifice, 10 by 8 yds., on a basement with two steps, one of
the best-preserved Roman tombs in Algeria.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Sétif through the <i>Chabet el-Akra</i> to <i>Bougie</i>, see R. 42.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to Djemila</span>, 19 M. to the N. of St. Arnaud, toilsome
but very repaying, is best made in one day, as there are no good night-quarters
on the route. We start very early, by mule, carrying a supply
of food. We follow the highroad to <i>Sillègue</i> (diligence in the aft.) as
far as the (12 M.) crossing of the bridle-path from Sétif, and ride thence
to the N.E. in about 2 hrs. to <b>Djemila</b>, a poor Berber village on a narrow
and lofty plateau amid barren mountains. This was once the Roman
<i>Cuicul</i>, whose ruins, partially excavated of late, are the finest memorials
in Algeria of the late-Roman epoch. The W. entrance to the forum was
the <i>Arch of Caracalla</i>, a single gateway 40 ft. high, of the year 216, recently
marred by a buttress for its support. On the S.E. side of the forum
is a <i>Temple</i>, of which part of the peribolos (55 by 37 yds.) and the walls
of the cella alone survive. To the N.W. of the forum are remains of a
<i>Fountain</i>. In the S.W. part of the ancient town are the ruins of <i>Thermae</i>.
The *<i>Theatre</i>, which originally had 24 tiers of seats, is remarkable for
its well-preserved stage, 37 by 8 yds., and still 19 ft. in height, the front-wall
being similar to that of Timgad (p. <a href='#Page_293'>293</a>) or of Khamissa, etc.</p>

with scanty relics of a forum-basilica with three halls. Near it are a Roman
and a contemporaneous Berber burial-ground, the latter containing many
dolmens (p. <a href='#Page_324'>324</a>) and also remains of old quarries. Beyond (20½ M.) <i>Aïn-Fakroun</i>
(3032 ft.) we ascend rapidly to the <i>Col d’Ourkis</i> (about 3480 ft.),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>which crosses one of the offshoots of the <i>Plateau des Sbakh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_274'>274</a>). 41 M.
<i>Canrobert</i> (3041 ft.; Arabic <i>Um el-Buaghi</i>), at the S. base of <i>Jebel Sidi
R’gheïss</i> (5341 ft.; with argentiferous lead-mines). The line runs to the E.,
across an upland plain where ruins abound.</p>

<p class='c022'>58 M. <b>Aïn-Beïda</b> (3307 ft.; Hôt. d’Orient, Hôt. de Paris, both rustic;
pop. 2400), in the territory of the <i>Haractas</i>, a large Berber tribe differing
but slightly from Arabs, is the starting-point of a road (diligence in
11 hrs.; railway under construction) viâ (20 M.) <i>Meskiana</i> to (52½ M.)
<i>Tebessa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>). The <i>Jardin Public</i> contains several Roman inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Aïn-Beïda the line turns to the S.W. towards the spurs of the
<i>Aurès Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). Stations unimportant. 72½ M. <i>Tarf</i>, near the salt-works
of the great salt-lake <i>Garaet et-Tarf</i> (2723 ft.). Far to the left rises
<i>Jebel Tafrent</i>, rich in phosphates. 83 M. <i>Baghaï</i> (2914 ft.), on the <i>Oued
Baghaï</i>, formerly <i>Bagai</i>, was one of the chief towns of the Donatists in
the 4th cent. (Thamugadi being the other, p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>), where in 394 a council
of 310 Donatist bishops was held, but after the 12th cent. it fell to decay.
The only memorial of its ancient importance is the ruinous <i>Ksar Baghaï</i>,
a Byzantine fortress (built in the time of Justinian, after 539), 360 by
335 yds., with 25 towers. On the N.W. side is a castle dominated by a
keep 84 ft. high.—The line then winds up to—</p>

<p class='c022'>91½ M. <b>Khenchela</b> (3730 ft.; Hôt. de France, Hôt. du Square, both
poor), a little town of 2900 inhab., once the Roman <i>Mascula</i>, the key of
the E. Aurès passes, and still the starting-point of important caravan-routes
to the Sahara. It carries on a thriving art-industry (manufacture of trinkets,
etc.) and holds a busy Tuesday market. The Roman ruins were
swept away when the present town was founded about 1860; but there
is a small collection of antiquities (conservator M. Catalogne).</p>

<p class='c022'>Road to Timgad, Lambèse, and Batna, see p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>. From that road
another diverges to the left to (4½ M.) <i>Aïn-el-Hammam</i> (about 3940 ft.),
prettily situated in the wooded valley of the brook of that name, with
a hot chalybeate spring (158° Fahr.). This was the <i>Aquae Flavianae</i> of the
Romans, whose *<i>Thermae</i>, probably erected under Vespasian, and restored
under Septimius Severus in 208, the best-preserved in Barbary, are now
again in use. We note specially the round hall, once domed, with its
circular piscina 26 ft. in diameter, and the large open piscina, 45 by 33 ft.,
with two vaulted lateral passages, flanked with side-rooms and basins.—A
bridle-path leads to the S.W. from Aïn-el-Hammam to (12½ M.) the
forester’s house of <i>Aïn-Mimoun</i> (4413 ft.), amidst fine cedar-woods (p. <a href='#Page_210'>210</a>),
whence we may descend to the N.E. to <i>Foum-Tizourit</i> on the Batna road.</p>

<p class='c009'>278½ M. <b>Le Khroub</b> (2051 ft.; Rail. Restaurant; Hôt. Victoria,
near the station; Hôt. d’Orient; pop. 9700, all Mohammedans but
500), the next station on the Constantine railway, has an important
cattle-market. On a stony hill to the E. of the town (2527 ft.), about
1 hr. from the railway, rises the <i>Mausolée du Khroub</i>, called by
the natives <i>Sauma</i> (tower), the tomb of a Berber prince of pre-Roman
times, built of huge blocks of stone in the Græco-Punic
style. The square pedestal, resting on a basement in three steps,
and part of the groundfloor adorned with round shields still exist.
The upper story, which consisted of a hall resting on eight Doric
columns with a grooved cornice, and the conical (?) summit were
probably destroyed by an earthquake.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>44. From Constantine to Biskra viâ El-Guerrah and Batna.</h3>

<p class='c016'>149 M. <span class='sc'>Railway.</span> Through-train, including a 1st class saloon carriage
(10 fr. extra) with ‘wagon-restaurant’ in winter, in 7 hrs.; ordinary train
in 8¾ hrs. (fares 26 fr. 85, 19 fr. 20, 14 fr. 40 c.). Views to the right as
far as Fontaine des Gazelles. Railway Restaurants at El-Guerrah, Batna,
and El-Kantara.</p>

<p class='c022'>Among the intermediate stations <i>Batna</i> is important only as the
starting-point for Lambèse and Timgad (R. 45). <i>El-Kantara</i> deserves a
stay of some days for the sake of its own scenery and as a base for excursions
to Tilatou, the Maâfa valley, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Constantine to (23 M.) <i>El-Guerrah</i>, see above and pp. <a href='#Page_273'>273</a>,
272. Passing (31 M.) <i>Aïn-M’Lila</i> (2527 ft.), we reach the <i>Plateau
des Sbakh</i>, the great steppe of E. Algeria, with its numerous salt-lakes,
‘dreary in the extreme, yet grand in its motionless repose,
with tufts of grey-green alfa growing here and there on the salt
soil, backed by the bold precipices and pinnacles of bare rocky
mountains’. Appropriate accessories are, however, furnished now
and then by the huts or tents of nomadic tribes with their herds.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the right rises the bare <i>Jebel Nif-Ensser</i>. Farther on we
obtain, especially by morning light, a fine view of the salt-lake of
<i>Tinsilt</i>, backed by the spurs of the Sahara Atlas (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>42½ M. <i>Les Lacs</i> (2592 ft.), on the neck of land between Lake
Tinsilt and (on the left) <i>Chott Mzouri</i>. We now traverse a long
embankment crossing Lake Tinsilt, which is often enlivened by
flamingoes and wild-duck. 53 M. <i>Aïn-Yagout</i> (2891 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>58 M. <i>Fontaine-Chaude</i> (about 2790 ft.), with a few tents of
nomads, near the small <i>Oued Mader</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Just before the station we observe on the left the <b>Medracen</b> (Arabic
<i>Madghasen</i>), a pre-Roman royal tomb (of Masinissa?), the finest of
the kind in Algeria after the Tombeau de la Chrétienne (p. <a href='#Page_238'>238</a>). The
huge monument (reached by a field-road from the station in 1¼ hr.)
stands in an ancient Berber burial-ground on the flat saddle between two
low, bare ranges of hills, about halfway between Fontaine-Chaude and
the (6 M.) <i>Sebkha Djendeli</i>, the ancient <i>Lacus Regius</i>. The Medracen,
one of the few existing tumulus-tombs in the Græco-Punic style, consists
of a massive cylindrical basement, 64 yds. in diameter and only 14½ ft.
high, on which rises a conical pyramid in twenty-four steps, crowned with
a platform of 12½ yds. in diameter (the total height being 60 ft.). The sixty
unfluted Doric half-columns recall the oldest Greek temples of Sicily,
while the concave moulding above the architrave is Egyptian in character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>The rude engravings on the basement, as well as the Libyan and late-Punic
inscriptions, are ancient. Of the vestibule, 26 by 16 yds., but few
vestiges are left. The straight passage leading to the two small tomb-chambers
in the centre of the building collapsed in 1865. The two other
shafts were bored by treasure-hunting natives.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the lofty valley of the Oued Mader we now reach the N.
fringe of the Sahara Atlas, between the spurs of the <i>Bellezma Mts.</i>
on the W. and <i>Jebel Bou Arif</i> (5728 ft.), a range parallel on the
N. with the Aurès Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>62½ M. <i>El-Mader-Pasteur</i> (2851 ft.) is the station for <i>El-Mader</i>,
the Roman <i>Casae</i>, a village with a little Byzantine fortress,
situated 5 M. to the S.E., at the foot of Jebel Bou Arif. A road
leads from this station also to (8 M.) <i>Pasteur</i> and (19 M.) <i>Zana</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The village of <i>Pasteur</i> (two inns), on the <i>Oued Seriana</i>, was the
ancient <i>Lamiggiga</i>. In the market are Roman and early-Christian relics.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Zana</b> (no inn), the Roman <i>Diana Veteranorum</i>, a considerable colony
of veterans, has several interesting ancient buildings. A triumphal arch
of 165 A. D. is well preserved with the exception of the attica. An arch
of Macrinus (217 A. D.) formed afterwards part of a small Byzantine
fortress. The portal of a temple is still standing. The ruined Byzantine
church in the forum was built chiefly of materials from Roman ruins.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train mounts a steep gradient to (66½ M.) <i>Fesdis</i> (3032 ft.),
in a defile scantily overgrown with bushes, between <i>Jebel Azeb</i>
(4485 ft.; on the left) and the Bellezma Mts.</p>

<p class='c016'>73 M. <b>Batna.</b>—<i>Rail. Restaurant</i>, déj. 3, D. 3½ fr., good.—<span class='sc'>Hotels</span>

<p class='c009'><i>Batna</i> (3412 ft.; pop. 7500, incl. 2400 Mohammedans and
700 Jews), founded in 1844 as a military base for the advance upon
Biskra, and now the chief military station in S. Constantine and the
key to the important Sahara pass of El-Kantara, is a peaceful country-town
with regularly-built streets, and offers no attraction save
perhaps the ‘<i>Village-Nègre</i>’ (comp. p. <a href='#Page_181'>181</a>), to the S.E. of the
Quartier Militaire. It lies near the sources of the Oued Mader in
a broad valley, often very cold in winter, between the wooded
Bellezma Mts. on the W., Jebel Azeb (see above) on the N.E., and
the spurs of the Aurès Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>) on the S.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tho finest point of view is <b>Jebel Touggour</b> or <i>Pic des Cèdres</i>
(6870 ft.), to the W. of tho town, a grand pyramid belonging to the Bellezma
group. A rough road (mule 4–5 fr.), leading close past the station, ascends
the valley to the W. and then the <i>Ravin des Gardes</i>, between Jebel
Touggour and <i>Jebel Bou Merzoug</i> (5840 ft.), to (7½ M.) the <i>Maison Forestière
Oued Hamla</i>. Thence a bridle-path on the richly wooded S. slope
of Jebel Touggour; lastly a climb, towards the N.E., through ancient but
neglected cedar-forest (p. <a href='#Page_210'>210</a>), to the (4 hrs.) summit. The immense panorama
embraces tho Bellezma group and the distant Hodna Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>) to
the W., the Plateau des Sbakh and the Tell Atlas near Constantine to
the N.E., the long range of the Aurès Mts. to the S.E. and S., and part
of the Sahara to the S.W.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Batna to <i>Lambèse</i> and <i>Timgad</i>, see R. 45.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Beyond Batna the train crosses the watershed (3543 ft.) between
the Plateau des Sbakh and the Sahara. Far away to the S.W. are
seen Jebel Metlili and the depression of the pass of El-Kantara
(see below). 80 M. <i>Lambiridi</i> (3527 ft.), near the scanty ruins
of the Roman town of that name.</p>

<p class='c011'>We descend the broad valley of the <i>Oued el-Ksour</i> or <i>Oued
Aïn Touta</i>, one of the sources of the Oued Biskra (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>), to (94 M.)
<i>Mac-Mahon</i> (3002 ft.; Arabic <i>Aïn-Tuta</i>), a poplar-shaded oasis
and alfa station (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>), originally founded by Alsatians. The
next part of the line, through a steppe furrowed by the brook and
the winter rains, is curious and interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'>99 M. <i>Les Tamarins</i> (about 2460 ft.) is not far from the famous
gorge of the stream, here called <i>Oued Tilatou</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The train next threads tunnels and cuttings through the saddle
between the Tilatou valley and that of the <i>Oued Fedhala</i> or
<i>Guebli</i>, the second feeder of the Oued Biskra, whence we descend in
a wide bend to the E. to (103 M.) <i>Maâfa</i> (about 2130 ft.), at the
influx of the brook <i>Maâfa</i> into the Fedhala (excursion to the
Maâfa valley, see pp. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>, 278).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the foreground we again sight the bold rocky slopes of El-Kantara.
We recross the Oued Guebli, which, below the mouth
of the Tilatou (see above), is named <i>Oued el-Kantara</i>, skirt the
S.E. base of the Metlili (p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>), and cross the stream to—</p>

<p class='c016'>114 M. <b>El-Kantara.</b>—<i>Rail. Restaurant.</i>—<span class='sc'>Hotel</span> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>).

Office</span>, opposite the hotel.—<span class='sc'>Carriage</span> 2½ fr. per hour.—<span class='sc'>Mule</span>
with English saddle, per day 5 fr., with Arabian saddle 3½ fr. (in the
villages of the oasis 2½ fr., when not ordered through a guide).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>El-Kántara</i> (1772 ft.; ‘the bridge’, so named from its Roman
bridge), the Roman <i>Calceus Herculis</i>, one of the most important
caravan-stations in E. Algeria prior to the opening of the railway,
owes its fame to the grand gorge of the Oued el-Kantara, called
by the natives <i>Fumm es-Sahara</i> (‘mouth of the desert’). The river
here suddenly emerges from a wild Alpine region, flanked by the
red limestone rocks of <i>Jebel Gaous</i> and <i>Jebel Essor</i>, into a highly
picturesque palm-oasis, below which it skirts the spurs of the <i>Aurès
Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>) and careers rapidly down to the Sahara.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the station the road on the left bank, overlooking the
river-bed, with its profusion of wild oleanders, and the charming
orchards on the floor of the valley, descends in 10 min. to the <i>Hôtel
Bertrand</i>, situated at the finest and wildest point of the ravine, in
a basin almost entirely shut in by grey rocky slopes. A few hundred
paces farther, just before the mouth of the *Gorge (here barely
45 yds. wide), is the <i>Roman Bridge</i>, which was too thoroughly
restored in 1862 under Napoleon III., carrying the old road, now
partly destroyed by a landslip, from the right bank of the river to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the left. From the bridge we enjoy a peculiar and striking view
across the palm-oasis to the red weather-worn rocks of the Montagne
d’Albâtre (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). A similar view is offered by the <i>Iron Bridge</i>,
8 min. lower down, whence we may look back also into the ravine
with Jebel Metlili rising behind it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The neighbouring *<span class='sc'>Oasis</span> (pop. 3500), with its three mud-built
villages, inhabited exclusively by natives of Berber descent, is, next
to Bou Saâda (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>), the northmost palm-oasis in Barbary. From
the iron bridge the road leads past a kubba and cactus-gardens
to (12 min.) <i>Dahraouïa</i>, the only village at the foot of the red rocks
of the right bank of the stream, named also <i>Village Rouge</i> from
the red mud-walls of the houses at its W. end, below the old burial-ground.
The flat roof of the lower mosque, situated on the steep
bank of the stream, affords a splendid view of the village and of
the oasis as far as the Village Noir (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now descend through luxuriant gardens to the right bank
of the El-Kantara, above which the village extends picturesquely,
cross the stream 10 min. lower down (by mule, or wading, or carried
by a native), and then, from the generally dry bed of the <i>Rivière
Blanche</i> (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>), mount to the right to <i>Bourabès</i> or <i>Village Noir</i>.
From the N. end of this village we ascend the valley in 8 min. to
<i>Gueraguère</i> or <i>Khrekar</i>, known also as the <i>Village Blanc</i>, the
largest village in the oasis. We may walk through it and regain
the hotel in 20–25 minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the El-Kantara is swollen we must return from Dahraouïa
to the iron bridge and visit Gueraguère and Bourabès from the left
bank. By carriage (7½ M., in 1½ hr.) we drive viâ Dahraouïa to
the S. end of the oasis, and return on the left bank viâ Bourabès
and Gueraguère. In the villages themselves we alight that we may
better appreciate the novelty of the scene.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<b>Jebel Metlili</b> (4900 ft.), a range of hills to the N.W. of El-Kantara,
scantily overgrown with scrub and alfa-grass (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>), commands
a splendid view of the steppe of El-Outaya (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>) and the Sahara, as
well as of the fringes of the Sahara Atlas as far as Jebel Ahmar-Khaddou
(p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>). The clearness of the air and the wonderful effects of light and
shade enhance the fascination of the scene. The mule-track (2½–3 hrs.)
leads to the W. through the valley of the generally dry <i>Oued Chebba</i>
and then winds up through a gorge and over the hill-side to the summit.
On the way are sometimes seen gazelles and aoudads or maned sheep (Ovis
tragelaphus, Arabic arwi; occasionally even at El-Kantara).</p>

<p class='c022'>The excursion to the *<b>Gorges de Tilatou</b> takes a whole day, or about
5–6 hrs. only if we go by train to <i>Les Tamarins</i> (p. <a href='#Page_276'>276</a>), sending mules
thither beforehand (provisions should be taken). Travellers from Biskra
should go by the morning train to El-Kantara and proceed thence on
mule-back to Les Tamarins, where they arrive in time for the afternoon
train to Constantine.—The very picturesque entrance to the Tilatou valley
is about 3 M. to the N.W. of El-Kantara. The grandest part of the gorge
is at the Berber village (dasbera) of <i>Tilatou</i>, with its curious, still partly
inhabited rock-dwellings. The village lies about halfway between the
mouth of the river and the station of <i>Les Tamarins</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>A visit to the <i>Maâfa Valley</i> takes a whole day from El-Kantara,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>or from the <i>Maâfa</i> station (p. <a href='#Page_276'>276</a>), with the ride back to El-Kantara,
6–7 hrs. at least. The mule-track leads past the S. base of <i>Jebel Groun</i>
(3905 ft.) and the small mosque of <i>Sidi Yahia</i> to the rock-villages of
<i>Fetatcha</i> and <i>Ameradsa</i>, inhabited by the Chaouïa (see below), at the
entrance to the wildest parts of the ravine. Good riders may return to
El-Kantara viâ <i>Beni-Ferah</i> (see below).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <b>Aurès Mts.</b>, the <i>Mons Aurasius</i> of antiquity (Arabic <i>Auras</i>), inhabited
almost exclusively by the <i>Chaouïa</i> (‘shepherds’), a Berber tribe,
not subdued by the French until 1845, rise to the E. of El-Kantara, culminating
in <i>Jebel Chelia</i> (7634 ft.) and <i>Kef Mahmel</i> (7615 ft.), the two highest
peaks in Algeria. This grand mountain-region, with the wild and interesting
valleys of the <i>Oued Abdi</i> and the <i>Oued el-Abiod</i>, is as yet almost
inaccessible to tourists, no quarters being obtainable except by the courtesy
of the French officials or of the natives. A tour here, especially
in winter, necessitates almost as tedious and costly preparations as travelling
in Morocco (comp. p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>). Better communication will, however, be
provided by the new, still unfinished road from <i>Markouna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>) to
<i>Biskra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>), by way of <i>Medina</i> (4780 ft.) and <i>Aris</i> (3842 ft.), opening
up the head of the Oued el-Abiod valley, thence following the line of
the ancient Roman road through the grand <i>Ravine of Tighanimine</i>, and
descending from the zone of the cedar-forests to <i>M’chounech</i> and <i>Droh</i>,
the palm-oases on the <i>Ahmar-Khaddou</i> (p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>A glance at the wild scenery of the Aurès Mts. is obtained by riding
past the <i>Jebel Haouidja</i> (see below) to (10 M.) <i>Aïn-Zatout</i> or <i>Beni-Ferah</i>
(about 2950 ft.), a picturesque hill-village of the <i>Beni Ferah</i> tribe. Strength
permitting, we may ride thence to the S. to (17½ M.) *<i>Djemmorah</i> (quarters
at the sheikh’s) and (29 M.) <i>Branis</i> (988 ft.), two palm-oases in the lower
Oued Abdi valley, belonging to the <i>Ouled Ziane</i>, the only Arab tribe in
the Aurès, and to (42½ M.) <i>Biskra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>After leaving El-Kantara the <span class='sc'>Railway</span> passes through three
short tunnels into the <i>Gorge of El-Kantara</i> (p. <a href='#Page_276'>276</a>). Near the
Roman bridge we obtain a striking glimpse of the <i>Palm Oasis</i>,
which, farther on, beyond the bed of the <i>Rivière Blanche</i>, we
survey in its full extent. Looking back, on the right, we have a
fine view of the red rocks in the gorge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Running to the S.W., generally close to the Oued el-Kantara, the
train skirts the slopes of the <i>Montagne d’Albâtre</i> or <i>Kef ed-Darsa</i>,
a spur of <i>Jebel Haouidja</i> or <i>Jebel Kteuf</i>, which are geologically
interesting and have a splendid red glow in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>125 M. <i>Fontaine des Gazelles</i> (1280 ft.) lies in a stony waste between
<i>Jebel Selloum</i> (2569 ft.), the S.W. buttress of Jebel Haouidja,
and the singular <i>Jebel Kroubset</i>. The small sulphur-baths of <i>Hammam
Sidi el-Hadj</i>, ½ hr. to the S.E. of the station, used by the
natives only, occupy the site of the Roman <i>Aquae Herculis</i>; an elliptical
Roman piscina, 107 yds. in circumference, still serves as a
bath. The spring (97° Fahr.) rises at the N. base of <i>Jebel el-Melah</i>
or <i>Gharribou</i> (2057 ft.), noted for its rock-salt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearing (131 M.) <i>El-Outaya</i> (905 ft.), we survey on the right
the extensive steppe of <i>El-Outaya</i> (‘the plain’), a kind of forecourt
of the Sahara, bounded on the S. by the Chaîne de Sfa (p. <a href='#Page_282'>282</a>) and
Jebel Matraf. The soil is white with saltpetre in places. To the
left, beyond the station is a small palm-grove.</p>

on the left the hills of <i>Ahmar-Khaddou</i> (p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>), sometimes snow-clad
in winter, the landmark of Biskra.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cross the <i>Plaine de Dar-Raous</i> or <i>Dar el-Aroussa</i>, often
enlivened by gazelles; it lies between the Aurès streams <i>Oued Bou

now called <i>Oued Biskra</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the ‘<i>Col des Chiens</i>‘, a barren gorge at the foot of

<p class='c022'><b>Guides</b> (p. xxvi; 4–5 fr. a day; 2 fr. for an evening only), like hawkers
and beggars, are a local pest, but their services are entirely superfluous,
even for drives or rides in the environs, where the drivers or attendants
give information.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Climate.</b> The season is Nov.–April. Lying at the S. base of the
Sahara Atlas and on the margin of the desert, Biskra has all the characteristics
of the Sahara climate (pp. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>, 171). The great fluctuations of
temperature (mean winter maximum 65° Fahr., mean minimum 45°) are
comparatively little felt, even by invalids, owing to the remarkable dryness
of the air. The rainfall is very slight and sunless days are quite the
exception. The dust, however, is sometimes troublesome, even in winter,
and sand-storms, especially during the sirocco (S.E. wind), may occur
at any season. When a cold N. or N.W. wind blows from the Sahara
Atlas, the palm-oasis alone affords some shelter. As yet no special arrangements
for invalids exist at Biskra.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Sights</b>, when time is limited. On arrival, view from the belvedere
of the <i>Royal Hotel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>). 1st Day. Visit to <i>Market</i> (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>) early,
then <i>Villa de Bénévent</i> and *<i>Old Biskra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>); in the afternoon, ride or
drive to the <i>Col de Sfa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_282'>282</a>). 2nd Day. Excursion to <i>Sidi-Okba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_283'>283</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The little town of <i>Biskra</i> (400 ft.; pop. 7400, of whom 6300
are Mohammedans, incl. Old Biskra) lies at the S. base of the low
<i>Chaîne de Sfa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_282'>282</a>), on the right bank of the <i>Oued Biskra</i>,
generally a very poor stream below the Barrage (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>). Owing
to its convenient situation at the end of the E. Algerian Sahara
railway, and to its fine climate, it has grown into great favour of
late as a winter resort and the ‘Nice’ of Algeria. The present town,
with streets regularly built as in all the modern Algerian towns,
has sprung up only since the French occupation of 1844. The mediæval
Biskra, named after the small Roman settlement of <i>Bescĕra</i>,
lay in the midst of the palm-oasis (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>), on the top and on the
slopes of a low hill, where, after the destruction of the town by
Sala Reïs (1553), a Turkish fort (kasba) was built. The natives
then settled anew in the still existing seven villages of the oasis.</p>

<p class='c016'>Biskra is the capital and administrative centre of the <i>Zab</i> (‘oasis’,
pl. <i>ziban</i>), the extensive girdle of oases on the S. fringes of the <i>Monts du
Zab</i> (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>) and the <i>Aurès Mts.</i> In accordance with their sites these oases
are named <i>Zab Dahraoui</i> (N. Zab), on the margin of the Monts du Zab, <i>Zab
Guebli</i> (S. Zab), on the <i>Oued Djedi</i> (p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>), and <i>Zab Chergui</i> (E. Zab),
between the Aurès Mts. and the <i>Chott Melrir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>). The natives of the
Zab, who are under an ‘agha’ or chief, are mostly Berbers with a large
infusion of Arabian and in some cases Turkish blood. Many of them, under
the name of <i>Biskris</i>, are met with in the coast-towns as small traders.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only business street is the <span class='sc'>Rue Berthe</span> (Pl. B, C, 1–3), in
the S. part of which there are a few small European shops. It intersects
the whole town and connects the railway-station with the
strangers’ quarter on the S. side.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Between the Rue Berthe and <i>Fort St. Germain</i> (Pl. B, C, 1, 2),
the nucleus of the town, built in 1849–51, runs the <i>Grande Allée</i>
past the <i>Jardin Public</i>, which, on its N.E. side, is adjoined by the
<i>Jardins de la Garnison</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue Berthe leads to the <span class='sc'>Avenue Delacroix</span> (Pl. C, 3), the
favourite haunt of guides and hawkers, where, at its junction with
the Square Dufourg, rises a bronze statue of <i>Card. Lavigerie</i> (Pl. 2,
C, 3; p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>), the benefactor of Biskra.</p>

<p class='c011'>The belvedere of the <i>Royal Hotel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>), 92 ft. high, resembling
a minaret (visitors kindly admitted), commands an excellent
*Panorama of the town and its environs, finest in the early
morning, or towards sunset, when the Ahmar-Khaddou (‘rosy cheek’;
p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>) is bathed in a ruddy glow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Casino Dar-Diaf</i> (Pl. B, C, 4; ‘house of the guests’),
built by A. Ballu (p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>) in the neo-Moorish style in 1892–3, is
the fashionable evening resort.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Mairie</i> (Pl. B, 2), the small <i>Mosque</i> (Pl. B, 3), and other
public buildings are situated between the Rue Berthe and the quiet
Boul. Carnot (Pl. A, B, 2, 3), which joins the Avenue Delacroix at
the Casino.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Marché</span> (Pl. B, 3) presents a busy and picturesque scene,
especially in the early morning, which will interest new-comers.
The motley throng of traders, many of them Mozabites (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>),
offer the art-industrial products of the Berber tribes of the Aurès
and the Sahara, besides Moroccan wares and ‘Oriental’ articles
made in Europe, at unduly high prices. The fruit and vegetable
market affords evidence of the fertility of the oases. The <i>Marché
aux Bestiaux</i> is held in the Boul. Carnot on Mondays.</p>

<p class='c016'>Camel caravans from the Sahara may be seen at the <i>Fondouks</i> (Pl. A,
3), the inns of the natives on the Route des Zibans.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quite modern <i>Village-Nègre</i> (Pl. C, 4; comp. p. <a href='#Page_181'>181</a>) is
very dirty and uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few hundred yards to the S. of the town, between the Route de
Touggourt and the Route de Sidi-Okba, is the <span class='sc'>Villa de Bénévent</span>
or <i>Jardin Landon</i> (Pl. C, 5; adm. 2 fr.), a creation of Count Landon
(p. <a href='#Page_305'>305</a>), the beautiful *Grounds of which are stocked with a
marvellous profusion of tropical and subtropical plants, and afford
a delightful shady retreat in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great attraction in the nearer environs is *<b>Old Biskra</b>
(<i>Vieux-Biskra</i>; see inset Map, at p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>), with its clay-built oasis-villages
(<i>ksar</i>, pl. <i>ksûr</i>) inhabited by Biskris (p. <a href='#Page_280'>280</a>), and its oasis
3 M. long by 110–550 yds. wide, with some 150,000 date-palms and
6000 fruit-trees (apricots, figs, oranges), besides corn-fields and
small kitchen-gardens. The palms, being well watered from the Barrage
(p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>), are well grown and beautifully green; the dates,
however, have less flavour than those of the Oued Rhir (p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the Djerid (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>), and particularly those of the Souf (p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>).
The traveller may induce a native (20–30 c.) to show him one of the
palm-gardens, or he may be satisfied with a glimpse at them over
the low mud-walls or through gaps.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Villa de Bénévent (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>) walkers follow the right
bank of the Oued Biskra, in the bed of which stands the kubba
of <i>Sidi Zerzour</i>, to the (20 min.) village of <i>M’Cid</i>, the eastmost
in the oasis, with its tall cypress, 130 ft. high, and its pertinacious
beggars. The lofty minaret of the small mosque of <i>Sidi Moussa</i>
or <i>Sidi Malek</i> (muezzin, 30–50 c.) affords a fine survey of the oasis,
backed on the N.E. by the distant and usually snow-clad Jebel
Chelia (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>), and extending to the S.E. to Sidi-Okba (p. <a href='#Page_283'>283</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>About ¼ hr. to the S.W. of M’Cid is the picturesque village of
<i>Bab el-Dharb</i>, infested by begging children, where, at the great
lotus-tree near the two conduits, we enjoy a charming view of the
palm-gardens. Close by is the mosque of <i>Sidi Abd el-Moumen</i>,
whose minaret is another famous point of view (ascent toilsome).</p>

<p class='c011'>Between Bab el-Dharb and the tramway-terminus (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>; Café
Petit Robinson) rises the <i>Kasba Hill</i>, crowned with the old mud-built
Turkish fort, now partly washed away by rain, where the first
French garrison was massacred by the natives in 1844. View
limited.</p>

<p class='c011'>The village of <i>Bab-Fath</i>, to the S.W. of the Kasba Hill, has
a picturesque shrine, the marabout of <i>Sidi Lahsen</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We return to Biskra by tramway on the Route de Touggourt,
passing the poor <i>Mohammedan Cemetery</i> on the left and the <i>Hôpital
Lavigerie</i> on the right; or we may choose the road (½ hr.)
through the village of <i>Ras el-Guéria</i>, noted for the gaily coloured
costumes of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c016'>For <span class='sc'>Carriages</span> (tariff, see p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>) the route prescribed for avoiding
the narrow roads is viâ M’Cid to Bab el-Dharb, and back by the Route
de Touggourt or viâ Ras el-Guéria. With this excursion may be combined
a drive to the small oasis of <i>Cora</i>, with most characteristic Sahara surroundings,
and to (6¼ M. from Biskra) the <i>Dunes d’Oumache</i>, or even to
the (10 M.) <i>Oase Oumache</i>, where the ksar, defended by ancient moats,
contains many remains of Roman buildings. Fine view at the marabout.
The excursion to Oumache takes at least half a day. Provisions should
be taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>The (5 M.) *<b>Col de Sfa</b>, which has long been famed for its
view, is a depression in the <i>Chaîne de Sfa</i>, between <i>Jebel Bou
Rezel</i> (1322 ft.) and <i>Jebel el-Mlaga</i> (1302 ft.), on the shadeless
road to El-Kantara and Batna. We drive (by the hour, see p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>),
or (preferable) ride to the pass; in the latter case we may extend
our trip from the pass to the (¼ hr.) ruinous Poste Optique, whence
we survey the steppe of El-Outaya (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>) to the N., and to the S.
the endless undulating expanse of the yellow Sahara, spotted like
a panther’s hide, as Strabo has described it, with its green oases
(Chetma, Biskra, Sidi-Okba, etc.). Finest light towards sunset.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>The (5 M.) <b>Hammam es-Salahin</b> (443 ft.; ‘bath of the saints’)
or <i>Fontaine-Chaude</i>, the Roman <i>Ad Piscinam</i>, is most conveniently
reached by tramway (p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>). The car runs through the whole of
the Boul. Carnot (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>), turns to the W. past a hill crowned with a
disused <i>Optic Telegraph</i> (Pl. A, 3), and then passes the small oasis
of <i>Beni-Mora</i> and crosses the streamlet <i>Oued Zemour</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Bath House</i> (pens. with baths 10 fr.) attracts many visitors
from Biskra, especially in summer. It lies in a most dreary region
between <i>Jebel Bou Rezel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_282'>282</a>) and the sandy <i>Jebel Maouya
Gorah</i>. The quadrangle, where the surprisingly copious salt and
sulphur spring (115° Fahr.) bursts forth, is enclosed by cells for
Europeans (1½ fr.) and men’s and women’s baths for the natives.
The roof-terrace affords a good view of the environs. About 1 M.
to the N. is a small mountain-lake of volcanic origin.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Jebel Maouya Gorah</i>, the E. spur of Jebel Matraf, is a good standpoint
for surveying the girdle of oases formed by the Zab Dahraoui and
Zab Guebli (p. <a href='#Page_280'>280</a>), stretching to the distant Oued Djedi (p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>). The
S. base of this range, where the building and paving stones of Biskra
are now quarried, is skirted by the <i>Route des Zibans</i>, much used by
caravans.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to Sidi-Okba</span> (13 M.; diligence, see p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>; carr.
tariff, see p. <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>, but 12–15 fr. is usually accepted) is the favourite
among the longer trips from Biskra. The Route de Sidi-Okba
(Pl. C, 4, 5) fords the Biskra (sometimes dangerous after winter
rains) and skirts the small oases of <i>Lalia</i> and <i>Filliache</i>. Between
these is the <i>Nécropole</i>, once a Berber burial-ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the long drive through the dreary steppe at the S. foot of
the Aurès Mts., enlivened only by the begging children of the
nomads, we are repaid by the verdant <i>Palm Oasis of Sidi-Okba</i>,
the most fertile of the Zab Chergui group (p. <a href='#Page_280'>280</a>), watered by a
network of conduits from the Oued el-Abiod (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The small town of <b>Sidi-Okba</b> (144 ft.; restaurant, at the entrance
to the town; pop. 4900), the religious centre of the Zab, owes
its origin and its fame as a resort of pilgrims to the tomb of Sidi
Okba (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), who ended his victorious career in the adjacent oasis
of Thouda. The now poor town, with its mud-built fortifications
and houses, and its beggars, lepers, and importunate guides, vividly
recalls a mediæval Sahara town.</p>

<p class='c011'>On alighting we walk straight on, then bear to the left, and
soon reach a small square with the <i>Maison du Kaïd</i> and other
picturesque houses. Turning here to the left we come to a second
place, where on the left, preceded by a colonnade, rises the plain
<i>Mosque of Sidi-Okba</i>, the oldest in Algeria, containing the tomb
of the saint, which is shown on Fridays only. The main entrance
to the court of the mosque consists of a carved *Door in the so-called
Berber style (10th cent.). The minaret should be ascended
for the sake of the excellent survey it affords of the town and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>oasis (custodian 50 c.). Adjoining the mosque is the <i>Zaouïa</i>, with
a Mohammedan law-school.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing through the gateway we now follow the first street on
the right to the <i>Market</i>, with its quaint and busy crowd.</p>

<p class='c016'>The steppe adjoining <i>Aïn-Naga</i>, 14½ M. to the E. of Sidi-Okba, on
the caravan route to <i>Négrine</i>, which in late-Roman times was an important
military road, is a favourite resort in winter of gazelle-stalkers from
Biskra. Mirages (Fata Morgana) are often witnessed here.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<span class='sc'>Excursion to M’chounech</span>, which is much grander than
the last-named, is very fatiguing, but will be greatly facilitated by
the opening of the new road through the Aurès Mts. (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). We
ride to the E., across the Biskra ford, to (5 M.) <i>Chetma</i>, a small
palm-oasis on the outskirts of the Aurès, where the road at present
ends. After a short rest in the village (ksar), with its mud-built
houses, or beside the adjoining springs, we proceed viâ (10½ M.)
<i>Droh</i> to (14 M.) <i>El-Habel</i> (778 ft.), where we reach the deep-set
valley of the <i>Oued el-Abiod</i> (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). We then ascend on the right
bank of the stream to (19 M.) <b>M’chounech</b> (1083 ft.; quarters
at the sheikh’s), a beautiful palm-oasis with 1300 inhab., at the
foot of the <i>Ahmar-Khaddou</i> (6315 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The hill on which the ksar stands affords a very curious and
striking view of the neighbouring *Ravines (accessible in dry
weather only) and the upper course of the stream with its oases,
as far as Baniane; but we may obtain a still grander view by riding
to the (24 M.) <i>Poste Optique</i> (3691 ft.), on the S. margin of
the Ahmar-Khaddou, whence the most impressive desert panorama
stretches as far as the Chott Melrir (see below). The summit of
the mountain may be gained in 4–5 hrs. more, but few travellers
will care to face the toilsome ascent.</p>

<p class='c022'>Hardy and well-equipped (pp. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>, 174) travellers will be repaid by the
interesting <span class='sc'>Sahara Route to Touggourt</span> (127 M.; ‘courrier postal’, open
omnibus with awning, on Mon., Wed., and Frid. at 3 a.m., in 28 hrs.,
excl. 10 hrs.’ halt for the night at M’raïer; fare 40 fr.; carr. from the
hirers Viallard or Tourenq, 300–400 fr.; a driver that speaks French should
be asked for). A railway from Biskra to Touggourt is now under construction.—The
Route de Touggourt leads to the S.E. from Old Biskra
(p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>) through the steppe to (19 M.) <i>Bordj Saâda</i> (85 ft.), in the plain
of the <i>Oued Djedi</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>), and thence to the S. to (32½ M.) <i>Bordj
Chegga</i>, to the W. of the <i>Chott Melrir</i> (95 ft. below the sea-level), the
largest salt-lake in Algeria. 45½ M. <i>Bir Sethil</i>, on the <i>Oued Itel</i>, across
the bed of which, generally dry, the road is carried by an embankment
over 100 yds. long, built of blocks of gypsum. 50 M. <i>Kef ed-Door</i> (374 ft.),
a plateau affording fine views, with a Poste Optique communicating with
Ahmar-Khaddou (see above), and said to be the southmost point reached
by Sidi Okba (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) in the course of his campaigns. 63½ M. <i>Ourir</i>, a
small oasis near the <i>Chott Merouan</i>, the S. arm of Chott Melrir, contains
the kubba of <i>Sidi Makfi</i>, a favourite resort of pilgrims.</p>

<p class='c022'>69 M. <b>M’raïer</b> or <i>Merayer</i> (13 ft. below sea-level; Caravansérail,
R. 2–3, B. ½, D. 3½ fr.; pop. 1700), a thriving but fever-haunted village,
with a luxuriant palm-oasis watered by artesian wells.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>We next come to the region of the <b>Oued Rhir</b>, also malarious,
with the largest girdle of oases in Algeria. These oases, artificially
irrigated under the French régime by the sinking of numerous very costly
artesian wells, have gained immensely in fertility, and their palms (about
950,000) supply the European markets with dates of the clear or pale
variety (deglet en-nûr). Passing the posting-stations of <i>Sidi-Khelil</i> and
<i>El-Berd</i> we come to <i>Ourlana</i> (69 ft.; pop. 4000), on the so-called <i>Sea
of Ourlana</i>, a chain of lakes where the water of the Oued Rhir comes
to the surface. 109½ M. <i>Djemaâ</i> (Caravansérail, R. 3, B. ¾, D. 3 fr.,
quite good), lies near the oasis of <i>Tiguedidin</i>, with its pretty lake in a
palm-grove. Then <i>Tamerna</i>, with 1600 inhab., and <i>Sidi-Rached</i>. The
swarthy complexion of the natives, mostly <i>Rouaras</i>, akin to the Harrâtin
(p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>), now indicates that we are nearing the Sudan.</p>

<p class='c022'>127 M. <b>Touggourt</b> or <i>Tougourt</i> (259 ft.; Hôt. de l’Oasis, Grande
Place, near the Bureau Arabe, R. 3, D. 3, pens. 12½ fr.; mule and attendant
5 fr. per day; pop. 7100), a rapidly increasing little town, with a
great Friday market, is important as the junction of the caravan-routes
to the Mzab (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>), Ouargla (or Wargla), and the Souf (see below). New
Touggourt (<i>T. el-Djedida</i>) lies at the foot of a hill crowned with the ruins
of Old Touggourt (<i>T. el-Khedima</i>). The distinguishing features of the town
are two tall square towers, a minaret, and the clock-tower of the Kasba.
The new gypsum-built houses, some of them in several stories, produce
a striking effect. The inhabitants—Rouaras, many Mozabites (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>),
and Jews and negroes who have embraced Islam—live in separate quarters
(<i>zgag</i>) and in large suburbs. Their home-industries, especially weaving
and carpet-making, are thriving. It is very interesting to ride through
the *<i>Oasis</i>, or to make an excursion to the S. to the little oasis town of
(8 M.) <i>Temacin</i> and the (9½ M.) <i>Zaouïa of Tamelhat</i>, one of the most
influential monasteries in the Sahara, with a superb *Mosque.</p>

<p class='c022'>In order to avoid the long route back to Biskra, and at the same
time to see more of the Sahara, we may ride from Touggourt viâ <i>El-Oued</i>,
to the N.E., in 4–5 days direct to <i>Nefta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>; trotting-camel to El-Oued
10, and for the ‘Saharien’ a fee of 3 fr. per day; comp. also p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>). The
caravan-route, marked only by pyramidal signals, crosses the great dunes
of the <b>Souf</b>, where ‘desert-roses’ (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>) abound, one of the N. offshoots
of the <i>Erg Oriental</i>, as the great E. desert of the Sahara is called. The
only houses of call are (12½ M.) <i>Bordj Mguitla</i>, (24 M.) <i>Bordj Mouiat
Ferdjana</i>, and (44½ M.) <i>Bordj Mouiat el-Kaïd</i>. The first village in the
Souf is (53 M.) <i>Ourmes</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>61½ M. <b>El-Oued</b> (263 ft.; good quarters at the house of the merchant
Sagnier, R. 3, déj. or D. 4¼ fr.; pop. 7400), the interesting capital of
the Souf, with windowless houses covered with barrel-vaulting and small
domes, is best viewed from the minaret or from the dune on the N. side.
El-Oued and particularly the neighbouring oasis of <i>Guémar</i> are famed for
their weaving; their wares are sent by the caravan-route to the S.E. viâ
Bir er-Ressof (Beresof) to Ghadâmes in Tripolitania.</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<i>Oases</i> of the Souf, containing about 180,000 palm-trees, have
quite a different system of cultivation from all others in Barbary. The
remarkably thick and long-leaved palms stand in funnel-shaped hollows
(entonnoirs, Arabic ritan), and are protected against sand-drift by palisades
of palm-twigs. The irrigation is provided by surface-water collected
in wells, from which the water is raised by means of long draw-beams.
The dates, owing to the peculiar mode of culture and the great heat of
the sun, are noted for their sweetness and fine flavour. They are usually
exported to Europe by way of S. Tunis.</p>

<p class='c022'>Beyond (74½ M.) <i>Debila</i>, where the high dunes end, we ride to the
Tunisian frontier across the pastures of the nomadic tribes, watered by
artesian wells. A delightful scene is presented by the watering of the
cattle, driven in from every direction, and indefatigably supplied by the
swarthy herdsmen.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Beyond <i>Choucht el-Ihoudi</i> and <i>Bir el-Asli</i>, the first stages in Tunisia,
we traverse the dreary steppe to the N.W. end of the <i>Chott Djerid</i> (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>),
through which we ride for a short way on the <i>Trik Douaria</i>. 137 M.
<i>Nefta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>), where we must announce our arrival at the custom-house.—From
Nefta viâ <i>Tozeur</i> to <i>Metlaoui</i> (and <i>Gafsa</i>), see pp. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>, 386.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>45. From Batna viâ Lambèse to Timgad.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Road</span>, to Lambèse 7 M. (diligence four times daily, in 1 hr.), to Timgad
23½ M.—The diligence from Batna to (67 M.) Khenchela (p. <a href='#Page_273'>273</a>), starting
at 4 a.m., reaches at 8 a.m., beyond the 35th kilomètre-stone (22 M.), the
point where the Timgad road diverges. One may therefore alight there
and walk in less than ½ hr. to Timgad. Returning from Khenchela the
diligence passes this point about noon. During the season motor-omnibuses
of the Hôt. des Etrangers run from Batna to Lambèse and Timgad (75 fr.
for the whole vehicle; single seat 25 fr.). A motor-omnibus of the Hôt.
Meille at Timgad also conveys travellers from the station at Batna to
Timgad and back (20 fr. each person; best to order beforehand). Carriages
(for one day 20–30, for two days 30–40 fr.) may be had at the hotels or
through the Rail. Restaurant. The fares are rather lower when arranged
with the drivers direct. Bicycles in the Square at Batna, 5 fr. per day.</p>

<p class='c022'>If pressed for time we may take the evening train from Constantine
to Batna, visit Lambèse and Timgad next day, and go on to Biskra in
the afternoon by train. Those who reach Batna from Biskra or El-Kantara
about noon may take lunch at the station, go on to Lambèse,
staying there for 1½–2 hrs., and thence to Timgad, whence they may return
next morning to Batna in time for the afternoon train to Constantine.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Batna</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_275'>275</a>. The road leaves the town by the <i>Quartier
Militaire</i> and ascends slightly, to the S.E., through the dreary
upland plain, where it is sometimes bitterly cold in winter, and
along the N. margin of the <i>Aurès Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). As we near the
hill-region of Lambèse we sight the ‘Prætorium’ in the distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>7 M. <b>Lambèse</b> or <i>Lambessa</i> (3875 ft.; quarters at the poor
cafés only), a village with a large <i>Pénitencier</i>, or Maison Centrale
de Correction, was founded in 1848 as a prison for political offenders
and partly built out of the ruins of the Roman <i>Lambaesis</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lambæsis was the headquarters of the famous Third Legion, the
nucleus of the Roman forces in Numidia, transferred hither about 100
A. D. from Tebessa (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>) for the defence of the chief Aurès passes, those
to the Oued Abdi and the Oued el-Abiod (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). Their oldest camp,
recently discovered, lay 1¼ M. to the W. of Lambèse; the newer camp,
mentioned as early as 146 A. D., is now partly built over by the penitentiary
and its garden. On a hill rising steeply from the plain, 1¼ M.
to the S. of the later camp, lay a civilian settlement (<i>canăbae</i>), occupied
at first by traders, artisans, and the soldiers’ families, but erected into
a municipium under Marcus Aurelius (161–180). This became the seat of
the governor of Numidia and for a short time prospered. But the punishment
of the Third Legion by Gordian III. (238), who removed it to the
Rhine for twenty-five years, the earthquake of 268, the extension of the
military frontier under Diocletian (284–305) to the S. border of the Sahara
Atlas, and the transference, under Constantine the Great, of the governor’s
seat to Cirta (p. <a href='#Page_298'>298</a>) were disasters from which Lambæsis never recovered,
so that by the 5th cent. it was completely abandoned.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Roman *<span class='sc'>Camp</span>, one of the best-preserved in existence, ‘the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>classic ruin of military occupation’ as it has been called, forms a
rectangle of 547 by 460 yds., with the usual rounded corners, and
four gates, between which ran the two main streets, the <i>Cardo</i> and
the <i>Decumanus</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We alight at the ancient <i>Porta Sinistra</i>, the W. gate. Between
this and the ‘Prætorium’ (see below) recent excavations have unearthed
remains of the Decumanus and its three N. side-streets, all
once flanked with colonnades, and the foundations of the barracks
built of concrete (p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>). The <i>Porta Praetoria</i>, the N. gate, at
the end of the well-paved Cardo, with its two passages and the substructures
of its two towers, is particularly well preserved. Near
it, adjoining the relics of the camp-wall, are the ruins of several
other towers.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the intersection of the Decumanus and the Cardo, 156 yds.
from the N. gate, rises the so-called **<i>Praetorium</i>, probably rebuilt
in 268, the monumental entrance-gateway of the residence of the
legate (prætorium or principia), the only intact Roman building
of the kind and the grandest Roman ruin in Algeria. This great
rectangular pile of solid masonry in two stories, 33½ by 25 yds.
in area and 49 ft. in height, is adorned outside with Corinthian
columns on high pedestals and with Corinthian pilasters. The four
great round-arched passages, of which the side and end ones are
flanked, respectively, by three and two smaller archways, open into
a central space, which, to judge from the four large bases of pillars,
was once probably furnished with a roof and lighted by the four
round-arched windows in the upper story.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of the so-called <i>Forum</i>, the chief court of the Prætorium, there still
exist remains of the colonnade and a number of side-chambers, once armouries.
(In the so-called arsenal at the N.W. angle many cannon-balls
and other missiles have been found.) To the S. of the forum is the
<i>Posticum</i>, with its offices and <i>Scholae</i>, the club-rooms of the officers and
sergeants (now ticketed), and the <i>Chapel</i> for the flags and insignia of the
Legion, recognizable by its large niche. The cellars served as the <i>Treasury</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Thermes du Camp</i>, the ancient baths, to the S.E. of the
Prætorium, show remains of the heating apparatus (comp. p. <a href='#Page_294'>294</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the E. gate, once the <i>Porta Dextra</i>, ran the road to
Verecunda (p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>) and Timgad and the Via Septimiana to the town-hill,
1¼ M. distant. In the open ground outside of it rises the
ruinous single <i>Arch of Commodus</i>. Near this is the <i>Amphitheatre</i>,
whose stones were used in building the penitentiary (p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now drive to the S. from the S.E. angle of the camp, where
carriages usually wait, to the <span class='sc'>Village</span>. At the <i>Mairie</i>, mainly built
with the stones of the Septizonium, a nymphæum or fountain, we
find the museum attendant (fee ½ fr.), who if desired will show also
the town-hill (fee).</p>

<p class='c011'>The small <i>Musée Municipal</i>, near the church, comprises, under
a shed, some mediocre statues from the temple of Æsculapius and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>splendid *Mosaics found in 1905 (one with an inscription by a
Greek artist), missiles, etc. The garden contains architectural
fragments, inscriptions, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>A road leads from the S. end of the village to the <span class='sc'>Town Hill</span>,
where excavators have not as yet discovered even the forum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the (¼ hr.) <i>Aïn-Drinn</i>, which now supplies the village
with drinking-water, are the almost unrecognizable remains of the
<i>Temple of Neptune</i>. From this point we walk to the N.E. past
the ruins of the <i>Aqueduct</i> and the foundations of four <i>Dwelling
Houses</i> to (10 min.) the chief temples.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Temple of Æsculapius</i>, at the W. end of the temple area,
a curiously planned edifice dating from the time of Marcus Aurelius,
consists of a cella, well-preserved in its foundations, with a large
semicircular niche for the statues of Æsculapius and Salus (or
Hygiea), and of a semicircular terrace (concave inwards), where a
square basement in front bore a Doric portico, which collapsed in
1852. In front of the flight of six steps lie remains of the architrave,
bearing the dedicatory inscription of the temple. Colonnades connected
the temple with two semicircular projections, flanking the
terrace, on which stood the ædiculæ or chapels of Jupiter Valens and
Silvanus. Behind the cella are vestiges of the <i>Thermae</i> connected
with the temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>A straight ancient road leads to the S.E. from the temple of
Æsculapius to the capitol, the distinctive feature of every Roman
colony. On the left lie the substructures of <i>Chapels</i> dedicated to
eight different gods (about 200 A. D.), all rectangular and each
with its niche, usually rounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Capitol</i>, the largest temple of Lambæsis, dedicated to the
cult of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, adjoins the W. wall of the ancient
temple-court, a quadrangle of 66 by 60 yds., of whose colonnades
eight columns only survive. A flight of twenty steps, most of
which also have disappeared, ascended to the temple portico, with
eight Corinthian columns in front and four at the back. The cella, still
fairly preserved, 22½ by 12¼ yds., consists, exceptionally, of only
two chambers, separated by a partition, with square niches for the
sacred images. On the temple steps lie fragments of the dedicatory
inscription of the ‘Respublica Lambæsis’.</p>

<p class='c011'>The capitol is adjoined on the E. by the court of a third <i>Temple</i>,
82 by 38 yds.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now follow the road on the hill to the E., leaving on the
left the so-called <i>Bains des Chasseurs</i>, and in 3 min. reach the
ruins of a <i>Triumphal Arch</i> with three gateways, on the old road
to Verecunda (p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>), and 3 min. farther a smaller <i>Archway</i>, to
which point carriages should be ordered. We then drive back to
the plain, to the N.W., by the Bertouli road, skirting the town-hill.</p>

<a href='images/i_289_large.jpg'><img src='images/i_289.jpg' alt='TIMGAD' class='ig001'></a>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>About halfway between this road and the highroad we pass
the ruins of a building once erroneously called the <i>Palais du Légat</i>,
and those of <i>Latrinae</i>. On the ancient Via Septimiana (p. <a href='#Page_287'>287</a>),
about a hundred yards farther, rises the *<i>Arch of Septimius
Severus</i>, with its three passages, bereft of its columns and attica.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>High Road</span> ascends past the remains (on the left) of a
<i>Roman Burial Ground</i>, with the substructures of an <i>Early
Christian Chapel</i>, under the ciborium altar of which are two
martyrs’ tombs. After a long bend to the N. it reaches (9 M. from
Batna) <b>Markouna</b> (about 4260 ft.), a country-house surrounded
by fruit-trees, cypresses, and pines, not far from the site of the
little Roman town of <i>Verecunda</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Markouna, just before the new road to Medina (and
Biskra; see p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>) diverges, rises the <i>Arch of Marcus Aurelius</i>
(172 A. D.). A little way to the S.W., on the old Roman road
coming from the town-hill of Lambæsis, stands another <i>Archway</i>,
dedicated to the same emperor in 162.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the road now descends to the N.E. into the dreary valley
of the <i>Oued Mérien</i>, we obtain on the right, beyond the 16th kilomètre-stone
(10 M.), a fine view of the crest of the Kef Mahmel
(p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>), which is snow-clad in winter. Beyond the 24th kilomètre-stone
(15 M.) we overlook a great part of the Aurès Mts. with Jebel
Chelia (p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). On the left is <i>Jebel Taguertine</i> (4511 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>After the 27th kilomètre-stone (17 M.) we sight, far to the
S.E., at the foot of the spurs of the Aurès, the ruins of <i>Timgad</i>,
where the two tall columns of the capitol gradually grow more
conspicuous. The road to (23½ M. from Batna) Timgad, which
diverges to the right beyond the 35th kilomètre-stone (21½ M.),
crosses the Oued Mérien and ends on the N. side of the ruins.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c016'><b>Timgad.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotel.</span> <i>Hôtel Meille</i>, 4 min. to the N. of the ruins,

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Ruins</span> may be visited at any time. The chief sights, named in
the text in heavy type, may be cursorily seen within 2–3 hrs. For closer
study <i>A. Ballu’s</i> Guide Illustré de Timgad (at book-shops 2½, 3½ fr. at
the Agence, p. <a href='#Page_291'>291</a>, where photographs and picture post-cards also are
sold) is valuable. Information as to recent excavations may be obtained
from the inspector <i>M. Barry</i>.—Comp, also ‘Carthage, Timgad, Tébessa’,

<p class='c009'><i>Timgad</i> (3520 ft.), known by the Berber name of <i>Thamugadi</i>
in the late-Roman period and one of the most thriving towns in
the E. Algerian highlands, dates from 100 A. D., when the legate
P. Munatius Gallus, commander of the Third Legion (p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>), was
ordered by Trajan to found the <i>Colonia Marciana Trajana
Thamugadi</i>, probably about the same time as Lambæsis, as the
key of the Fount Ksantina (p. <a href='#Page_296'>296</a>). The town saw its prime in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>second half of the 2nd and in the 3rd cent., but in the 4th cent.,
like Bagai (p. <a href='#Page_273'>273</a>), it was a centre of the Donatist movement and
suffered severely in the wars of the period. After fruitless attempts
by the Vandals to revive it, Thamugadi was destroyed by the
hostile Berber tribes of the Aurès Mts. in 535. Having been finally
abandoned at the close of the Byzantine domination, the ruins of
the town, with the exception of Trajan’s Arch, were gradually buried
under the deposits of torrents, and for twelve centuries the place
was consigned to complete oblivion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The excavations begun by the French government in 1880, and
recently conducted by the architect A. Ballu, have brought to light
the most important parts of the town, including the Forum, two
Markets, the Capitol, and no less than eleven Thermæ. While the
private houses are mostly unpretending and very inferior to those
of Pompeii, the public buildings afford most striking evidence of
the ancient prosperity of this remote Roman provincial town.</p>

<p class='c016'>The oldest town, laid out as a square camp (comp. p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>) of 384 yds.
each way, in conformity with its original destination as a frontier-fortress,
has four central gates, between which ran the two main streets, the Cardo
Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus, intersecting each other at right
angles. The ‘Cardo Maximus Nord’ opens into the Decumanus at the
Forum, where it stops owing to the unevenness of the soil. Some 90 yds.
farther to the W., however, the ‘Cardo Maximus Sud’ leads out of the
Decumanus. The rapid increase of the population, especially on the E.
and W. sides, on the busy roads to Tebessa (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>) and Lambæsis, led
as early as the 2nd cent. to the construction or extensive new streets on
a less regular plan. By the 5th cent. the population, which had greatly
declined, withdrew from the suburbs into the ancient walled precincts,
which by this time had been much built over at places.</p>

<p class='c022'>The main streets are bordered with Doric colonnades and paved with
bluish limestone slabs; the smaller streets have sandstone pavement.
The waggon-ruts are deep, especially in the Decumanus Maximus, and
are slightly farther apart than at Pompeii (4 ft. 3 in. and 4 ft. 1 in.).
The excellent drainage-system is now utilized anew, as may be seen
from the gutters at the street-corners.</p>

<p class='c022'>The usual building material was concrete (<i>opus incertum</i>, small
stones mixed with mortar), often faced with brick, or stone-framework
(the interstices being filled with brick or rubble-work). The private houses
usually occupy an <i>Insula</i>, as the square block enclosed by four streets
was called. The shops (<i>tabernae</i>) in the main streets were all entered
from the street, except when the trader lived in the same house. As a
rule the houses, like modern Moorish houses, have their backs turned to
the street, looking into an arcaded court (peristyle) in Oriental fashion,
instead of opening into a roofed atrium in the ancient Roman style.</p>

<p class='c009'>We begin our walk at the N. end of the town. On the right,
just outside the old town-wall, lie the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Grands Thermes du Nord</b> (Pl. D, 1), the largest Roman
baths in N. Africa. They form a rectangle of 88½ by 70½ yds.,
and contain thirty-five different chambers, all symmetrically constructed
like others of the later Roman period. Parts of the walls
are still 23 ft. in height.</p>

<p class='c016'>A flight of ten steps on the E. side of the building leads to the
<i>Vestibulum</i>, the main entrance to the baths. The adjoining chamber on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>the left opens on to a suite of three spacious halls. The two outer ones
were probably the <i>Palaestra</i> for gymnastics and games. In the corner,
obliquely opposite the entrance-wall, is a kind of shaft or passage leading
to the <i>Apodyterium</i> (undressing and dressing room). The central
hall is the largest <i>Frigidarium</i>, containing three basins (<i>piscinae</i>). The
chamber on the S. side, between the two smaller basins, served as a
passage to the <i>Tepidarium</i>, for hot-air baths and massage. Adjoining
the tepidarium on the S. is the largest <i>Caldarium</i>, with three hot-water
basins (<i>alvei</i>). Two side-rooms were the <i>Laconica</i> or sweating-baths.
Adjacent to them were two smaller <i>Caldaria</i>, to the N. of which, next
to the palæstra, were two other <i>Tepidaria</i>. The two rooms at the S.E.
and S.W. corners of the baths, each with an ante-room (apodyterium?)
and large semicircular niche, are supposed to have been <i>Frigidaria</i>.—As
to <i>Heating Apparatus</i>, comp. p. <a href='#Page_294'>294</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little to the left of the main entrance to these Thermæ is the
quaint <i>Mannikin Fountain</i> (Pl. D, 1), restored from ancient
fragments.</p>

<p class='c011'>The insignificant building on the E. side of the road is the
<b>Agence-Musée</b> (Pl. D, E, 1), containing the offices of the directors
of the excavations and a collection of objects found at Timgad.
These, however, with the exception of some mosaics, the chief
adornment of the African-Roman dwelling, show a provincial and
mechanical style of art.</p>

<p class='c016'>Along the outside walls are ranged the larger sculptures, a great stone
vase, fragments of buildings, and Saturn stelæ.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Entrance Room (I) contains pottery, including numerous lamps.—Room
II. Smaller fragments of sculpture, bronze implements, etc.—Rooms
III &#38; IV. Desk-cases containing the most valuable finds, notably
glass, clay-vases, small implements in bronze and bone. Under the
cases are water-pines, etc.—Against the walls are placed mosaics: in
R. III, Diana and Actæon, with the name of the artist (Selius), and
Neptune in a quadriga; in R. IV, Jupiter and Antiope (inscription,
‘Filadelfis vita’), and Amphitrite on a marine centaur.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now enter the oldest part of the town by the central <i>Porte
du Nord</i> (Pl. D, 1), 13¼ by 5¾ yds., preserved only in its lower
parts. Between the pillars of the gateway, once enriched with
Corinthian half-columns and pilasters, are the ancient guard-rooms.
On the floor are relics of an inscription of 149 A.D., which names
Antoninus Pius as the restorer (or finisher) of the gateway.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first building on the left side of the <span class='sc'>Cardo Maximus
Nord</span>, a street ascending steeply for 185 yds., is that of the Petits
<i>Thermes du Nord</i> (Pl. E, 1). On the left, beyond the fourth side-street,
is the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Library</b> (Pl. E, 2), one of the most curious buildings in the
town, resembling the library in the forum of Pompeii, which was
once supposed to be a shrine of the Lares. The building is preceded
by an open colonnade, with two small chambers on each side. Two
side-doors lead into the rectangular book-rooms, while the central
door, as in all antique libraries, opens into a kind of sanctuary,
with a large central niche flanked by four recesses on each side
(for the sacred images), and approached by a basement in three
steps, with ornamental columns.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The Cardo Maximus Nord leads to the main entrance to the
Forum (see below) in the <span class='sc'>Decumanus Maximus</span>, the chief thoroughfare
of the town. To the right, at the W. end of the latter, rises
Trajan’s Arch (p. <a href='#Page_295'>295</a>). We descend to the left. On the left, near
the old E. gate of the inner town, are the <i>Grands Thermes de
l’Est</i> (Pl. F, 2), whose tepidarium contains remains of mosaic pavement.
We turn back here, and in the third S. street off the Decumanus
Maximus we come to the <i>Petits Thermes de l’Est</i> (Pl. F, 2),
where two of the rooms contain restored marble benches.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, on the same side of the Decumanus, comes the *<b>Marché
de l’Est</b> or <i>East Macellum</i> (Pl. E, F, 2), the smaller town-market,
very curiously planned.</p>

<p class='c016'>A flight of eight steps ascends to a semicircular vestibule occupying
the middle of a platform 30 yds. wide and 2¼ yds. deep, on to the right
and on to the left sides of which open six small shops, three of them
facing the street and three the courtyard. The latter, really a double
court, consists of two segments of a circle with a triangular fountain
at their intersection. Adjacent, along the back-wall, right and left, are
five stalls with the old stone counters. In the centre of each half-court
is an open semicircular colonnade with water-runlets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost immediately to the W. of the market-hall, a later addition,
is the <b>Maison aux Jardinières</b> (Pl. 4; E, 2), a private
house with a fine garden-court, once adorned with flower-beds.
These were enclosed by high segment-shaped stone balustrades.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the <i>Fountain</i> at the next street-corner, at the N.E. angle
of the Forum, are the <b>Latrinæ</b> (Pl. 3; E, 2), the finest ancient
building of the kind, with a washing-basin and excellent cleansing
arrangements. The double seats (originally 25) have marble arms
adorned with dolphins.</p>

<p class='c011'>A propylæum, with a vestibule (16 ft. wide) and twelve steps
forms the main entrance to the *<b>Forum</b> (Pl. E, 2, 3), the focus
of municipal life, to which foot-passengers only were admitted. It
was completed in the reign of Trajan, and conforms pretty closely
in plan to the rules laid down by Vitruvius. It forms a large
rectangle, 110 by 65 yds.; the area or central space, 55 by 47 yds.,
is enclosed by Corinthian colonnades. The vestibule and area were
once adorned by a crowd of equestrian statues of emperors and
figures of distinguished governors of Numidia and eminent citizens.
The so-called Marsyas, the symbol of civic liberty, marked Thamugadi
as one of the most favoured colonies, whose inhabitants enjoyed
the full rights of Roman citizenship. Besides the pedestals of
thirty-two statues, we note also several representations of figures
of a game (comp. p. <a href='#Page_318'>318</a>) on the stone slabs of the pavement; among
the inscriptions annexed is the light-hearted ‘venari lavari ludere
ridere occ (hoc) est vivere’ (to hunt, bathe, play, and laugh is to live).</p>

<p class='c011'>The chambers on the N. side of the Forum were perhaps <i>Club
Rooms</i>. The two-storied <i>Shops</i> on the S. side opened, on the upper
floor, into the Theatre Street (p. <a href='#Page_293'>293</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>The only building on the E. side of the Forum is the very
dilapidated <b>Basilica</b> (Pl. E, 3), once the exchange and court of
justice. Unlike most other ancient edifices of the kind, it is a
single hall (31 by 16 yds.), with three niches at the N. end and
five small chambers on the E. side. The large square niche at
the S. end, at the foot of the theatre hill, served as a law-court.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the buildings on the W. side of the Forum the two in the
middle are the <b>Curia</b> (Pl. E, 3), where the town-council (ordo
decurionum) met, a rectangle of 17 by 12 yds., with a colonnade
in front and platform behind, and a small <i>Temple</i> (Pl. 8; E, 3),
preceded by a speaker’s platform (<i>rostra</i>), 6¾ ft. high. The purpose
of the other buildings is unknown.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the <i>Fountain</i> at the N.W. angle of the Forum we turn to
the S., out of the Decumanus into the Voie de la Curie, and thence
to the left into the Voie du Théâtre (38 ft. wide), on the S. side of
the Forum.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Theatre</b> (Pl. E, 3), dating from 167, lies on the W. slope
of an isolated hill. It held about 4000 spectators, but little of it
is left, as the materials were used in building the Byzantine fortress
(p. <a href='#Page_296'>296</a>). The semicircular orchestra, with its three tiers for the
places of honour (<i>bisellia</i>), allotted to the decuriones and other
persons of distinction, is well preserved. The <i>Cavea</i>, or auditorium,
69½ yds. wide, rising on the hill-side, once had twenty-six tiers
of seats, but of these the seven lowest only remain. The stage
(<i>pulpitum</i>) has been destroyed with the exception of the front-wall,
with its niches and steps, and the hyposcenium, consisting of brick
pillars (29½ in. high), which supported the floor of the stage. The
large colonnaded hall behind the former back-wall of the stage
served as a promenade (‘foyer’).</p>

<p class='c016'>The hill behind the cavea of the theatre, where the remains of a
<i>Temple Court</i> have been unearthed, affords a splendid *Survey of the
ruins. The view extends to the W. to the distant hills near Batna; to
the S.E., beyond the great débris-strewn slopes of the lower hills, rise
the Aurès Mts.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the centre of the theatre colonnade we may walk to the
W. to the <i>Petits Thermes du Centre</i> (Pl. E, 3), with admirably
preserved heating apparatus in the caldarium and laconicum (p. <a href='#Page_291'>291</a>)
on the W. side.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the W. side of these baths runs the <span class='sc'>Cardo Maximus Sud</span>,
the finely paved main street of the S. quarter of the town, leading
past the entirely ruined S. Gate (Pl. E, 4) and the house of the
Sertii (on the right; p. <a href='#Page_294'>294</a>), and ending at a <i>Fountain</i> in the Voie
des Thermes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Thermes du Sud</b> (Pl. E, 4), of the 2nd cent., extended
in 198 and restored about the end of the 3rd cent., are the finest
in the town next to the N. Thermæ.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>A peculiarity of this building consists in the three great Exedræ,
semicircular projections on the N.E. and S. sides. The semicircle near the
S. entrance contained the Latrinæ, now almost entirely destroyed. The
great colonnaded hall near the N. entrance served as a promenade. From
the Palæstra, 26 by 10 yds., the largest hall in the baths, bathers could
enter the Apodyterium as well as the Frigidarium, flanked by its two
piscinæ. The small ante-rooms behind the Frigidarium opened into the
heated rooms: on the right the Tepidarium, on the left the large Caldarium
with its three hot-water basins, and, straight in front, a smaller
Caldarium with two basins. The quadrangular space between the caldaria
was the Laconicum.</p>

<p class='c022'>The cellars on the S. side were partly occupied by the <i>Praefurnium</i>
(furnace room). Huge stoves (<i>furnaces</i>) heated the water in cylindrical
boilers (<i>testudines</i>, no longer existing) and also the air, both for the
<i>Hypocaustum</i>, or hollow floor resting on low brick pillars, and for the
hollow tiles (<i>tubuli</i>) or nipple tiles (<i>tegulae mammatae</i>) with which the
hollow walls of the hot rooms were lined.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the S.W. of the thermæ is an <i>Artisan Quarter</i> with a pottery
and a bronze-foundry.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may now visit the Byzantine Fortress (p. <a href='#Page_296'>296</a>) or else go
direct to the <b>House of the Sertii</b> (Pl. D, E, 4), one of the richest
families in the town (comp. p. <a href='#Page_295'>295</a>). This building, a great rectangle
of 68 by 35½ yds., comprising no fewer than three insulæ
or blocks, was built on the site of the ancient town-wall, and
extends as far as the Voie du Capitole.</p>

<p class='c016'>The colonnade in the Cardo Maximus Sud opens on a square <i>Vestibulum</i>.
Adjacent, on the right, were a shop of the owner’s, the lodge
of the porter (<i>ostiarius</i>), and the stairs ascending to the bath-rooms
(<i>balineum</i>). Next to the vestibule came the <i>Peristyle</i>, a colonnaded court
in the Doric style, off which opened the owner’s reception-room (<i>tablinum</i>),
the dining-room (<i>triclinium</i>), and several bedrooms (<i>cubicula</i>). On the
left there was a staircase to the upper story. A second peristyle, with
a fountain-basin and a fish-pond (<i>vivarium</i>) was flanked by the offices.
The large room at the back was the banqueting-room (<i>oecus</i>). On the
W. side of the building were several shops for letting.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the W. side of the inner town, outside the town-wall, which
has here been built over, runs the broad <span class='sc'>Voie du Capitole</span>, at the
upper end of which rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Capitol</b> (Pl. C, D, 4; comp. p. <a href='#Page_288'>288</a>), originally one of the
grandest temples in the whole country. A flight of four steps
ascends to the propylæum, a portico of twelve columns lately re-erected.
The vast temple-court is an irregular quadrangle of about
98 by 68–73 yds.; the peribolos or enclosing wall was restored,
according to an inscription, under Valentinian I. in 365. Still later
the S. colonnade was converted into a closed corridor with shops.
In the middle of the court is the basement of the ancient altar.</p>

<p class='c011'>A lofty flight of steps, originally 38, broken halfway up by a
platform, formed the approach to the temple (58 by 25 yds.). The
cella, now destroyed, had three niches, a portico of six columns,
and lateral colonnades, while the back-wall was closed. Two of the
gigantic columns of the portico, 44 ft. high, have been re-erected,
while the huge drums and capitals of others lie around, notably on
the S. side of the temple.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>We now walk down the Voie du Capitole to the <b>Marché de
l’Ouest</b> (Pl. D, 3), or <i>West Macellum</i>, the largest covered market
in the town, probably built by one of the Sertii (p. <a href='#Page_294'>294</a>) early in
the 3rd century.</p>

<p class='c016'>The entrance is in the small Place du Marché, on the S. side of the
Decumanus Maximus. The entrance colonnade (<i>chalcidicum</i>) leads into
the quadrangle, 37 by 27 yds., paved with large slabs of limestone and
surrounded by colonnades. In the centre originally stood a square fountain
(<i>tholos</i>). At the N. end, near the entrance, were two shops on each side
and the stairs to the upper floor. The most curious feature of the building
is the raised *<i>Exedra</i>, once roofed, on the S. side of the court, with
seven deep recesses, closed, like those of the E. Market (p. <a href='#Page_292'>292</a>), by the
stone counters of the sellers. Remains of the entablature are exhibited
on the outer wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rectangular ‘<i>Marché aux Vêtements</i>’ (Pl. C, D, 3), on the
W. side of the Place du Marché, was probably a minor market.</p>

<p class='c011'>Close by, on the N. side of the Decumanus Maximus, rises the
small <i>Temple du Génie de Timgad</i> (Pl. C, D, 3, 4), ‘a miniature
capitol’, dedicated in 151 to the genius of the colony. Three flights
of steps ascend to the temple-court with relics of the altar. The
temple, with its four Corinthian columns in front, is a mere
ruin.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next visit *<b>Trajan’s Arch</b> (Pl. D, 3), the best-known
triumphal arch in Algeria, an extremely massive structure, 40 ft.
high, much restored in 1900. This was once the W. gate of the
inner town (comp. p. <a href='#Page_296'>296</a>). Instead of the usual corner-columns
of the earlier triumphal arches, it has on each side four projecting
Corinthian columns, whose entablature is relieved with rounded
pediments in front of the attica. The two middle columns on the
E. side terminate in eagles holding thunderbolts in their talons,
instead of in volutes as in the usual capital. Of its three passages,
which could be closed by means of portcullises, the central
one was for vehicles, the two side-arches for foot-passengers.
The square niches over the side-gateways, each crowned with an
ædicula, were originally adorned with statues.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to the inner part of the town. Between the first
and the second S. side-street of the Decumanus Maximus is the
<i>Maison de la Piscina</i> (Pl. D, 3), a large dwelling-house occupying
two insulæ, so named from the granite basin in the peristyle,
adorned with nine little columns of red marble. The œcus, or
festal hall, at the S. end, has a tasteful mosaic pavement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the second and third S. side-streets of the Decumanus
Maximus lies the open quadrangle of a <i>Granary</i> (horreum), containing
numerous grindstones (pilons à blé; Pl. 7, D 3). The house
beyond the third side-street contains a <i>Cellar</i> (hypogæum) resting
on pillars and lighted by small windows.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fourth N. side-street of the Decumanus Maximus, in a line with
the Voie de la Curie, leads to the ruins of a <b>Monastery</b> of the Byzantine
age, containing a balineum or bathroom. The <i>Basilica</i> (Pl. 2, D, 2) is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>a complete ruin. To the N.W. of it is the <i>Baptistery</i> (Pl. 1; D, 2), with
relics of the font and its colonnade.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <i>House of Januarius</i> (Pl. 5; D, E 2), to the N.E. of the church,
still has its balineum.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>Time permitting, we may visit the ruins outside the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the great N. Thermæ (p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>) we may walk past the
<i>Dépôt des Tapis Indigènes</i>, where the carpets made by the Berbers
of the Aurès are sold (adm. free), to other remains of <i>Thermes</i>
(Pl. C, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of this point lies the early-Christian <b>Cathedral</b> (Pl.
C, 2), separated by a low hill from the outer Decumanus Maximus.
This was a basilica with nave and two aisles, 42 by 18½ yds., with
clustered columns and traces of the choirscreen and altar-basement.
The sacristies (prothesis and diaconicon), adjoining the raised apse,
seem to have been entered from the aisles only.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next cross the hill and descend to the S.W. to the outer
Decumanus Maximus. Here, on the left, quite near the bed of a
recently formed torrent, is the <i>Château d’Eau</i> (Pl. B, 3), the remains
of an octagonal nymphæum or fountain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crossing the bed of the stream, and passing, on the left, the
<i>Thermes du Nord-Ouest</i> (Pl. B, 2), we reach the outer <i>Porte de
l’Ouest</i> (Pl. B, 2), a single gateway of the age of Marcus Aurelius,
well preserved in its lower parts.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Nymphæum we ascend on the right bank of the brook
towards the Capitol (p. <a href='#Page_294'>294</a>), past an early-Christian <i>Chapel</i> (Pl.
C, 4), almost destroyed by the stream. Another early-Christian
<i>Basilica</i> lies to the S.W. of the Capitol. In the vicinity a large
<i>Monastery</i>, including a church and a baptistery containing a font
with fine mosaics, has recently been discovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Climbing over the hill to the S. of the Capitol, we have another
survey of the extensive ruins, and then walk to the S. to the Byzantine
fortress, 5 min. beyond the S. Thermæ (p. <a href='#Page_293'>293</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Byzantine Fortress</b> (beyond Pl. E, 4), erected under
Justinian with stones from the theatre, the Capitol, and other Roman
buildings for defence against the Aurès Berbers, forms a vast rectangle,
122 by 80 yds., with walls 8 ft. thick, still rising to a height
of 23 ft. on the W. side. Four central and four corner towers, and
on the S. side a sallying gate, have been preserved.</p>

<p class='c011'>The so-called <i>Gregory’s Basilica</i>, on a hill 3 min. to the S.W.
of the fortress, the latest building in the town, dates only from the
time of the governor Gregory (7th cent.; p. <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>About 2 hrs. to the S.W. of Timgad lie the ruins of the ancient Berber
town of <b>Ichoukkàn</b>, on a lofty plateau inaccessible on three sides, above
the rock-gateway of <i>Foum Ksantina</i> (‘Constantine-Gate’), so called from
the resemblance of its situation to that of Constantine. Near it are extensive
burial-grounds with thousands of graves.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Constantine</i> (1752–2113 ft.; pop. 55,000, incl. 28,300 Mohammedans
and 8300 Jews), Arabic <i>Ksantina</i> or <i>Blad el-Hawa</i> (‘cité
aérienne’, ‘town of air’), the capital of the province of that name
and the seat of a bishop and of a medersa (Mohammedan college),
is the third-largest town in Algeria. The old town, typically
Berber in its difficulty of access, lies on a chalky limestone plateau,
descending to the S.E. and N.E. almost perpendicularly to the
<i>Ravine of the Rhumel</i>, and to the N.W. to the bed of a brook,
while on the S.W. it is connected by a narrow saddle with the spurs
of the long <i>Jebel Chettaba</i> (4313 ft.). The town has three suburbs,
the small <i>Faubourg d’el-Kantara</i> near the station, and the faubourgs
<i>St. Jean</i> and <i>St. Antoine</i> on the margin of the <i>Coudiat-Aty</i>
(Pl. A, 5, 6), a hill recently almost levelled to form a building-site.</p>

<p class='c011'>Constantine is the centre of the Algerian grain-trade and has
an important wool-exchange. Several manufactures too are very
active (tanning, shoemaking, saddlery, and weaving). The chief
centres of trade and manufacture are still the native quarters,
resembling the Kasba of Algiers, the picturesque charm of which
has so far been marred by the construction of but few new streets.
The gay costumes of the Mohammedans and the mediæval attire of
the Jewesses are specially interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Constantine has but a poor climate. Spring is the best season
for visiting it. In winter the cold (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>) is very severe and the
winds are often bitter, while in summer and autumn the hot sirocco
is more prevalent than anywhere on the coast. The low ground
flanking the Rhumel is malarious from June to October.</p>

<p class='c016'>Constantine, originally the Phœnician <i>Kartha</i> (‘town’), afterwards
called <i>Cirta</i> by the Romans, was the greatest inland centre of culture
in the territory of the Numidian kings, and under Syphax became their
residence. The first recorded conquest of the town was by Jugurtha
(p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>), in B.C. 112, who wrested it from his cousin Adherbal. Under
the Roman empire Cirta, the chief of the four allied <i>Coloniæ Cirtenses</i>
(Constantine, Milo, Philippeville, and Collo), belonged to the <i>Diocesis
Numidia</i>, the domain of the legate of the Third Legion (p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>). Having
been destroyed by the troops of Emp. Maxentius in 311, the town
sprang up anew from its ruins the following year; it then superseded
Lambæsis as the capital of Numidia, and was named <i>Constantina</i>, in
honour of its patron Constantine the Great. In 435 it was the only town
in Barbary that repelled the attacks of the Vandal Genseric (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>),
but it remained politically unimportant till the Moorish period, when it
was occupied by the Hammadites (p. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>), and afterwards belonged in
turn to the Almohades (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), the Merinides (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), and the Hafsides
(p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>). In the middle ages it rivalled Bougie as a seat of learning.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the Turkish period Constantine was the capital of the E. Algerian
beylic, and for centuries groaned under the despotism of the beys. In
French military annals it was noted for its heroic defence by <i>Ahmed Bey</i>,
who after the fall of Algiers had become the independent ruler of E. Algeria.
In 1836 the first French attack upon the El-Kantara gate from
the hill of Mansoura proved a disastrous failure, over five hundred of
the besiegers being hurled into the ravine of the Rhumel. The capture
of the town in 1837, effected from the Coudiat-Aty, was purchased with
the death of generals Damrémont and Perrégaux.</p>

<p class='c022'>During the first decades of the French domination all the Roman
buildings were destroyed except the aqueduct (p. <a href='#Page_302'>302</a>), the Rhumel bridge
(p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>), and the cisterns (p. <a href='#Page_300'>300</a>). The buildings of the Turkish period
afford an instructive example of the sad decline of late-Moorish art.</p>

<p class='c009'>The railway-station (Pl. D, 4) is at present connected with the
old town by the iron bridge of *<b>El-Kántara</b> (Pl. D, 3; 1863), of
one arch, 139 yds. long and 407 ft. above the Rhumel. Far below
we see the Roman bridge (p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>), and upstream we have a fine
view of the S. part of the gorge. Much higher up is the <i>New Bridge</i>
(comp. Pl. C, 6), a marvellous feat of engineering. It spans the
Rhumel ravine, at a height of 330 ft. above the river, with a single
arch of masonry, 230 ft. in width.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the former Porte d’el-Kantara runs the new <span class='sc'>Rue Nationale</span>
(Pl. C, B, 4), the chief thoroughfare of Constantine, leading
through the whole town to (½ M.) the Place de Nemours. Halfway,
where the street bends and is crossed by the Rue Perrégaux
(p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>), rises the new <i>Medersa</i> (Pl. 7, C 4; see p. <a href='#Page_297'>297</a>) in the
Turkish-Moorish style; from its staircase we enjoy an even finer
view of the Rhumel ravine than from the crossroads.</p>

<p class='c011'>Halfway along the upper part of the street, on the left, rises
the <b>Grande Mosquée</b> (Pl. B, 4, 5; Arabic <i>Jâma el-Kebîr</i>), which
received a new façade and minaret when the street was made. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>very dissimilar columns which support the timber ceiling in the
interior are partly from ancient buildings. Two antique Doric
capitals recall the columns of the mausoleum of Le Khroub (p. <a href='#Page_273'>273</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The noisy and dusty <span class='sc'>Place de Nemours</span> or <i>Place de la Brèche</i>
(Pl. B, 4, 5; 2054 ft. above sea-level), on the site of the <i>Bâb el-Djadia</i>
or <i>Porte de la Brèche</i>, is the chief scene of the town’s
traffic. A few paces to the S.W., between the old town and the
<i>Coudiat-Aty</i> (p. <a href='#Page_297'>297</a>), are two public gardens. On the left, next
the street leading to the new bridge, is the pretty <i>Square No. 1</i>
(Pl. A, B, 5), with a bronze statue of Valée; and on the right <i>Square
No. 2</i> (Pl. A, 5), with numerous Roman antiquities. The latter
affords a splendid view of Jebel Chettaba (p. <a href='#Page_297'>297</a>), of the lower
valley of the Rhumel visible a long way down, and of the distant
heights of El-Kantour (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>). The road between the two squares
proceeds to the S.W. to the <i>Monument of Gen. Lamoricière</i> (Pl.
A, 5) by Belloc (1909), in front of the <i>Halle aux Grains</i>.—From
the latter the new <i>Viaduct</i> (comp. Pl. A-C, 5, 6; 490 yds.), now under
construction, will eventually lead to the New Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_298'>298</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beneath the Hôtel de Paris et Royal (p. <a href='#Page_297'>297</a>), at the E. corner of
the Place de Nemours, a flight of 90 steps descends to some interesting
<i>Grottoes</i> (adm. 1 fr.), whose sparkling, rose-shaped crystals of
gypsum produce a very unique effect.—From the N. angle of the
square the Boul. de l’Ouest leads along the town-wall to the <span class='sc'>Hôtel
de Ville</span> (Pl. 6; A, B, 4), of 1903, whose staircase and vestibule are
enriched with onyx and six kinds of marble from Aïn-Smara (p. <a href='#Page_272'>272</a>).
The first floor contains the <i>Town Library</i> and behind it the—</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Musée de Constantine</b>, comprising antiquities and natural
history collections. Adm. (except Sun. and Tues.) 9–11 and 3–5, 50 c.
Conservator, M. Ulysse Hinglais. Catalogue (1905) 1 or 5 fr.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the <span class='sc'>Staircase</span> are Roman mosaics.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room I.</span> In the central cases are prehistoric finds from the Tell Atlas
and the Oued Rhir (p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>); Byzantine and early-Moorish antiquities from
Morsott (p. <a href='#Page_314'>314</a>) and Kalâa des Beni-Hammad (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>); natural history
specimens (incl. vegetable fibres utilized industrially). The wall-presses
contain fossils from the hill of Mansoura (p. <a href='#Page_302'>302</a>) and Jebel Sidi M’Cid;
Phœnician and Roman antiquities from the necropolises of the Coudiat-Aty,
of Collo, Bulla Regia, etc. (clay vases, fine Roman bronzes, a glass
cinerary urn, trinkets, cut gems). By the wall of exit are Spanish-Moorish,
Italian, and Kabylian ceramics, Moorish fayence from Tlemcen,
Nabeul (p. <a href='#Page_365'>365</a>), etc.; a late-Moorish door; a Turkish executioner’s sword
from Khenchela. Here too are a map of the artesian wells in the province
of Constantine and a model of a boring apparatus.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room II.</span> The show-cases contain coins and medals. In the wall-presses,
natural history specimens; marble and onyx from Aïn-Smara. On
the walls, a small collection of pictures.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Gallery</span> (on the left of R. I). Large Roman clay vessels, neo-Punic
and Roman stelæ, Roman sculptures, Moorish fragments, casts.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Boul. de l’Ouest the Boul. du Nord (Pl. A, B, 4, 3;
fine views) and (to the right) the Rue du Rocher lead to the <i>Kasba</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_300'>300</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>The busiest streets of the European quarter, where many of the
inhabitants are Italians and Maltese, are the <span class='sc'>Rue Caraman</span> (Pl. B, 4)
with the Rue Chevalier, the Rue d’Aumale, and the <span class='sc'>Rue Damrémont</span>
(Pl. B, 4, 3), all to the N. of the Place de Nemours. Between these
lines of streets lies the spacious <span class='sc'>Place du Palais</span> (Pl. B, 4).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Palais de Hadj Ahmed</b> (Pl. B, 4; now military headquarters),
on the N.E. side of the square, built by Ahmed Bey in
1828–35, contains four picturesque courts, adorned with tiles. The
front court is decorated with clumsy frescoes depicting chief towns
of the Orient. The interior is not shown. Concierge ½ fr.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. 2, B 4; <i>Notre-Dame des Sept-Douleurs</i>),
on the E. side of the Place du Palais, was once the Market Mosque
(<i>Jâma Sûk er-Rezel</i>), with its nave and double aisles, built in
1707. The women’s galleries next the entrance-wall now contain
the organ. The choir is a modern addition. In the outer right aisle,
in the middle of the E. wall, with its well-preserved tile and stucco
decoration, is the old mihrâb (p. <a href='#Page_180'>180</a>), now a chapel. The mimbar
in the inner left aisle is now the pulpit; behind it is a copy of the
inscription on the Rocher des Martyrs (p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue Caraman, continued by the Rue Chevalier, and the
Rue de France (Pl. B, C, 4, 3) both lead to the N.E. to the <span class='sc'>Place
Négrier</span> (Pl. C, 3), in which rises the Mosque of <i>Sidi el-Kettani</i>
(Pl. 8; B, C, 3), built by Sala-Bey. The first floor of the building
contains a marble mimbar executed by Italian sculptors. On the
N. side of the square is a new <i>Synagogue</i> (Pl. 11; C, 3).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N. end of the town, partly on the site of the Roman capitol,
is the old <b>Kasba</b> (Pl. B, 3; 2116 ft.; 666 ft. above the Rhumel),
now a group of new buildings, including barracks and the military
hospital. Of the <i>Roman Cisterns</i>, originally a quadrangle of 164
by 39 yds., about one-third has been preserved and is now again
in use. The view from the garden of the <i>Artillery Arsenal</i> (Pl. B,
C, 2, 3), at the N. end of the Kasba, immediately above the ravine
of the Rhumel, is justly extolled. Adm. by leave of the military
authorities (Palais de Hadj Ahmed; see above). Entrance in the Rue
Damrémont (p. <a href='#Page_299'>299</a>). From the Kasba the new <i>Suspension Bridge</i>
(‘Pont Suspendu’; Pl. C, D, 2, 3) crosses the Rhumel at a height of
590 ft. to the <i>Hôpital Civil</i> (Pl. D, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Native Quarters</b>, intersected by the upper Rue Nationale,
with their lively, picturesque, crooked streets, lie in the lower
part of the town, between the Place de Nemours, Rue Caraman,
Rue de France, and the Rhumel ravine (p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>). The most interesting
streets are those inhabited by Mohammedan artisans, largely
Mozabites (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>), between the Rue Combes (Pl. B, 4) and the Rue
Vieux (Pl. B, C, 4, 3), both of which lead to the N.E. to the Place
Rahbet es Souf (‘wool-market’) or Place des Galettes (Pl. C, 4),
with its <i>Market Hall</i>. Between this square and the Boul. de l’Est
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>(Pl. C, 3), a fine point of view, lies the <i>Jewish Quarter</i>, which is
worth seeing, especially on Saturdays.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still more picturesque than these quarters is the purely Mohammedan
*<i>Quartier Perrégaux</i>, which descends the triangular S. part
of the rocky plateau, often in steep steps, from the Rue Nationale
to the Rhumel Ravine. Through this quarter runs the <span class='sc'>Rue Perrégaux</span>
(Pl. C, B, 4, 5), the chief thoroughfare between the Rue Nationale
and the old Turkish <i>Porte Djebia</i> (Pl. B, 5). Near this gate,
at the corner of the Rue Perrégaux and Rue des Tanneurs, is a
<i>Mosque Portal</i> with charming tile-decoration.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Rue Perrégaux we may descend by the Rue de l’Arc
and (to the right) the Rue de l’Alma, or direct by the Rue Morland,
under the new bridge, to the small kubba of <b>Sidi-Rached</b> (Pl. B,
C, 6; 1752 ft.). From the adjacent rocky height we have a grand
view of the upper Rhumel ravine. Opposite, near the old <i>Pont
du Diable</i> (Pl. B, C, 6), is the <i>Rocher des Martyrs</i>, bearing an old
inscription in memory of the Christian martyrs of 259.</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Gorges du Rhumel</b>, the grandest ravines in the Tell
Atlas, present a most impressive scene, especially during the melting
of the snow or after heavy rain, but in summer much of their charm
is lost owing to the lowness of the stream and the stench of the
tanneries. The gorge was first made accessible in 1895 by the
<i>Chemin des Touristes</i>, a path 1¾ M. in length, constructed by the
engineer Fr. Rémès. From the S. entrance (Pl. C, 6; 1811 ft.), near
the new bridge, it descends parallel with the Chemin du Rhumel
(10 min. above the station), close past the main entrance (see below)
and under the El-Kantara bridge and the new Suspension Bridge
to the lower end of the ravine (1512 ft). It is to be connected with
the new N. entrance (Pl. B, 2), on the Corniche road (p. <a href='#Page_302'>302</a>), by
a side-branch. Tourists pressed for time may go direct from the
station to the S. entrance, walk down the gorge as far as the
grottoes, turn back there, and then leave by the main entrance.
A ticket for the day (2 fr., or for repeated visits ½ fr. each time)
admits also to a bath in the Bains Rémès.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main-entrance, near the so-called Porte Vitruve (1730 ft.),
is reached from the Boul. de l’Est, 45 yds. to the N. of the old El-Kantara
gate (p. <a href='#Page_298'>298</a>), by an uncomfortable path descending in steps;
another descends from the Corniche road on the opposite side
(‘Entrée’; Pl. D, 3), 3 min. below the bridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before entering the gorge we may glance at the remains of the
<i>Roman Bridge</i>, which crosses the river at the narrowest part,
66 yds. across. The sculptures, two elephants and a weather-worn
relief of Africa, belonged perhaps to a still older bridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the ticket-office we first walk upstream, on the right bank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>by the <span class='sc'>Upper Path</span>, often up and down steps. The rocky sides of
the gorge are enlivened by numerous storks, pigeons, and hawks;
far below us the river dashes down its stony bed. High above
peep the picturesque houses of the native quarter. On the left bank
are the <i>Bains Rémès</i>, with a hot spring (90° Fahr.), and remains
of a Roman <i>Aqueduct</i>. They are reached by a side-path to the
right, ca. 220 yds. beyond the ticket-office. The baths, or <i>Piscinae</i>,
originally Roman, have been entirely renewed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther up (¼ hr.), a path in steps ascends to the left, under
the new bridge, not far from the Pont du Diable and the Pointe de
Sidi-Rached (comp. p. <a href='#Page_301'>301</a>), to the S. entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to the chief entrance, and near the office descend
to the left, by a path with steps and iron stairs, to the *<i>Grottoes</i>,
230 ft. high at places, through which the river flows, mostly underground,
for a distance of 330 yds.; the huge dome of rock is
specially impressive when viewed from the middle of the iron footbridge.
A winding staircase next descends to the <span class='sc'>Lower Path</span>,
with its wire-fence and benches. Passing below the new Suspension
Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_300'>300</a>) we reach the last arch of rock (retrospect of the
grottoes) and in a few minutes the lower (N.W.) end of the gorge,
above the <i>Cascades</i> (Pl. B, 2).</p>

<p class='c016'>Those who do not care to return to the El-Kantara bridge may ascend
direct from the last archway to the Corniche road.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Rhumel Fall, dashing over rock-terraces to a depth of 212 ft.,
the precipice below the Kasba, and the Rocher Sidi M’Cid (see below)
are all admirably viewed from the <b>Moulins Lavie</b> (Pl. A, 2), on the left
bank, 10 min. from Square No. 2 (p. <a href='#Page_299'>299</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The traveller should not omit to take a short walk on the superb
*<b>Route de la Corniche</b> (Pl. D-B, 3–1), starting from the El-Kantara
bridge. Below the <i>Hôpital Civil</i> (p. <a href='#Page_300'>300</a>) two short tunnels
carry the road through the <i>Rocher Sidi M’Cid</i>, an offshoot of Jebel
Sidi M’Cid (2575 ft). The finest point is (¼ hr.) a small projecting
platform at a bend in the road, whence we look down on the
Rhumel Fall and the baths of Sidi M’Cid.</p>

<p class='c016'>In a dale at the N. base of the Rocher Sidi M’Cid lies the pleasant
<i>Hammam Sidi M’Cid</i> (Pl. B, 1), with saline springs and two large swimming-baths.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ‘<span class='sc'>Grand Tour</span>’ (1–1¼ hr.; carr. 3–4 fr.; bargain advisable)
is a favourite drive by the Route de Sétif (Pl. A, 5, 6; affording
a fine retrospect of the Quartier Perrégaux), and across the uppermost
Rhumel bridge, to the <i>Roman Aqueduct</i> (p. <a href='#Page_274'>274</a>); thence from
the Route de Batna to the right to the <i>Pépinière</i>, in a dale full
of fruit-trees, and charming in spring; lastly over the pine-clad
<i>Mansoura Hill</i>, crowned with a fort, and back by the Chemin
de Mansoura (Pl. D, 5) to the bridge of El-Kantara.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Philippeville</i> (Arabic <i>Skikda</i>; pop. 26,000, incl. 16,000 Europeans,
mostly Italians and Maltese, and 4800 Mohammedans), the
youngest Algerian seaport, was founded by Marshal Valeé in 1838
as a harbour for Constantine. It lies on the fine <i>Gulf of Stora</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>), about 1 M. to the W. of the mouth of the Safsaf (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>),
in a ravine between <i>Mont Skikda</i> (548 ft.) to the E. and <i>Jebel Bou
Yala</i> to the S.W. Its site is that of the ancient <i>Rusicade</i>, once
a Phœnician town, but founded anew by the Romans in 45 B.C.
Under the empire, as the <i>Colonia Veneria Rusicade</i>, it belonged
to the league of Cirta (p. <a href='#Page_298'>298</a>), but, according to local tradition, it
had ceased to exist by 484. The chief harbour in the gulf, being
well sheltered, was formerly the neighbouring <i>Asthoret</i>, now <i>Stora</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_306'>306</a>), but it has been superseded by that of Philippeville, constructed
in 1860–80 at a cost of some 20 million francs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Harbour</b>, after Bona (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>) the chief outlet for the
produce of the province of Constantine, consists of an excellent
inner basin of 50 acres (<i>Grande Darse</i>; Pl. C, D, 1) and an <i>Avant-Port</i>
(Pl. A, B, 1) of 75 acres. The <i>Grande Jetée du Nord</i> (Pl. D, 1),
running out from Cape Skikda, is 1 M., the <i>Jetée du Château-Vert</i>
(Pl. A, 1), on the W. side, ¼ M. in length.</p>

<p class='c011'>The best points for viewing the harbour and bay are the <i>Place
de Marqué</i> (Pl. B, C, 2; popularly <i>Pl. de la Marine</i>), the pretty
<i>Petit Bois</i> or <i>Jardin de l’Hôpital</i> (Pl. C, 2), adjacent on the E.,
and the lofty <i>Place des Zouaves</i> (Pl. D, 2, 3; drilling-ground).</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Past the Place de Marqué runs the <span class='sc'>Rue Nationale</span> (Pl. B, C, 2–4),
the main street, connecting the chief gates, the N.W. <i>Porte de
Stora</i> (Pl. B, 2) and the S. <i>Porte de Constantine</i> (Pl. C, 4), whence
issue the Constantine, Bona, and Guelma roads. The narrow gorge
affords room for only a few parallel streets. The side-streets ascend
the hill-sides partly in steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Théâtre Municipal</i> (Pl. 7; B, C, 3), in the narrow Place
du Commerce, on the W. side of the Rue Nationale, stands on the
foundations of a Roman temple. A little farther, on the E. side of
the street, is the pretty <i>Square Carnot</i> (Pl. C, 3).—To the W.
from this square the Rue Gambetta leads to the <i>Collège Communal</i>
(Pl. B, 3). On the N.E. slope of Jebel Bou Yala, behind the school
(apply to the concierge here, 30–50 c.) lies the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Roman Theatre</b>, the largest in Algeria, erected at the earliest
under Hadrian; but as it was used as a quarry for building the
modern town, little of it is now left. Of the cavea, 90 yds. wide,
which held 5–6000 spectators, only a few steps, two passages, and
relics of vaulting remain. The stage is below the school-building.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Rue Gambetta the Rue Valée (Pl. B, C, 3, 4) leads
through the heart of the Mohammedan quarter to the Rue St. Augustin
and the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Museum</b> (Pl. 3; C, 4). The collections include some valuable
Roman antiquities. Adm. daily, 8–6; Sun. and Thurs. free; on other
days 1 fr.; catalogue (1901) 1 fr. 10 c.; curator, M. L. Bertrand.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Garden</span> contains numerous Roman columns, statues, etc.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Pavillon Central</span> has archæological collections on the groundfloor.
In the centre, 173. Roman milestone, from Hadrian’s road from
Rusicade to Cirta (p. <a href='#Page_298'>298</a>); 151. Antoninus Pius, in marble. In the first
wall-press are objects from Roman tombs, mostly from Rusicade; 687.
Genius, a statuette in marble. Detached, 749. Punic tomb-stela. In the
second wall-press, Roman vases and lamps; also, *805. Bust of a youth,
after an Attic work of the age of Praxiteles; 806. Bust of Agrippina the
Elder; 778. Punic stela of the goddess Tanit, from Carthage; 779. Mithras

of Hadrian. By the following end-wall, Roman inscriptions and altars.
At the other end, one early-Christian (293) and two late-Roman sarcophagi
(224, 331), Roman inscriptions, etc.—The 1st Floor contains ethnographical
and natural history collections and pictures.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Pavillon Nord</span> contains coins and medals, the <span class='sc'>Pavillon Sud</span>
a small collection of weapons and flags.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> Bearing a little to the left from the Porte de Constantine
(see above), we cross the large Place des Chameaux (Pl. D, 4),
where an interesting <i>Cattle Market</i> is held on Thursday mornings,
and then follow the S. slope of Mont Skikda (p. <a href='#Page_304'>304</a>), past the <i>Cemetery</i>,
to (½ hr.) the <b>Château Landon</b> or <i>Domaine des Lions</i>,
which has a beautiful garden. (Visitors require the permission of
M. Gallard, the superintendent, Rue Galbois.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The St. Charles (and Constantine) road leads through the <i>Faubourg
de l’Espérance</i> in the fertile dale of the <i>Oued Zeramna</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>past the (2½ M.) <i>Ecole Pratique d’Agriculture</i>, to the prettily
situated village of (3¾ M.) <i>St. Antoine</i> (33 ft.; diligence 25 c.).</p>

<p class='c016'>From St. Antoine we may visit, viâ the Route de Praxbourg, the <i>Oued
Amida</i>, or upper valley of the Zeramna, a hill-region where cork-tree
plantations abound, and a favourite resort of wild-boar and jackal hunters.
Or we may follow the Chemin de la Carrière Romaine across the <i>Col Chambœuf</i>,
on <i>Jebel Soubouyou</i> (1050 ft.), to <i>Damrémont</i> (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>To the W. of the Porte de Constantine a picturesque road leads
viâ <i>Montplaisant</i> to the dale of <i>Beni Melek</i>, famed for its wine.
We may return thence viâ the Porte des Citernes (Pl. A, 3) and
Rue d’Orléans, or descend the Chemin du Beni-Melek to the Route
de Stora.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a visit to <b>Stora</b> we may take the *<i>Route de la Corniche</i>,
the beautiful new shore-road which starts from the Place de Marqué
(Pl. B, C, 2) and at places is tunnelled through the living rock
(ca. 2 M.; diligence). Or we may follow the picturesque <i>Route de
Stora</i> (2½ M.), the old upper road, beginning at the Stora Gate
(p. <a href='#Page_305'>305</a>). <i>Stora</i>, a fishing-village with sea-baths, is now inhabited
chiefly by Italians. The fine view hence extends to Jebel Filfila
and the Cap de Fer (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>). On the steep shore are fragments of
an <i>Aqueduct</i>, partly underground, and several <i>Cisterns</i> (restored),
relics of the Roman Asthoret (p. <a href='#Page_304'>304</a>). A vault now used as a
laundry probably belonged to a <i>Nymphaeum</i> or fountain.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>48. From Constantine to Bona viâ Duvivier.</h3>

<p class='c016'>135½ M. <span class='sc'>Railway</span>, in 7–8¾ hrs. (24 fr. 65, 17 fr. 60, 13 fr. 20 c.).
The morning train has a dining-car between Le Khroub and Duvivier.
Buffets at Le Khroub and Duvivier. The only intermediate station of
interest is Hammam-Meskoutine.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Constantine to (10 M.) <i>Le Khroub</i>, see pp. <a href='#Page_274'>274</a>, 273.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our line diverges to the E. from those to Algiers and Biskra
(RR. 43, 44) and ascends between low hills in the bleak valley of
the <i>Oued Berda</i>, a tributary of the Oued Bou Merzoug (p. <a href='#Page_272'>272</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>18 M. <i>Bou-Nouara</i> (2330 ft.) has an ancient <i>Berber Necropolis</i>,
whose dolmens and rock-tombs, 1¼ M. to the N. of the
railway, extend along the spurs of <i>Jebel Mazela</i> (3412 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>25½ M. <i>Aïn-Abid</i> (2822 ft.), the highest point on the line,
lies on the watershed between the Oued Berda and the <i>Oued Zenati</i>,
one of the feeders of the Seybouse (p. <a href='#Page_308'>308</a>). 35 M. <i>Aïn-Regada</i>
(2487 ft.), also in a dreary steppe.</p>

<p class='c011'>42 M. <b>Oued-Zenati</b> (2268 ft.; Hôt. de France), pleasantly
situated on a partially wooded hill-side, the only large village
before Guelma, has a busy market (Sun., Mon., Thurs.).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Road to Guelma</span> (28 M.; diligence in 4¼ hrs.) leads to the N.E.
through a pretty hill-country direct to <i>Medjez-Amar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_308'>308</a>), just before
(14¼ M.) <i>Aïn-Amara</i>, and below <i>Thibilis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_307'>307</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Road and railway make a long bend to the W. round the hill-region
of <i>Bou Hamdan</i>. Beyond (52 M.) <i>Bordj Sabath</i> (1759 ft.),
where, below the influx of the <i>Oued Sabath</i>, the Zenati is called
<i>Oued Bou Hamdan</i>, the scenery changes. The valley, whose
slopes are richly overgrown with olive-trees and underwood, contracts.
In the stony river-bed grow many wild oleanders.</p>

<p class='c011'>59 M. <i>Taya</i> (1312 ft.), a pleasant oasis with fruit-trees and
eucalypti, lies near the stalactite grottoes, not easy of access, in the
limestone hill of <i>Jebel Taya</i> (3963 ft.). The valley again contracts
in the two <i>Gorges de Taya</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>68 M. <b>Hammam-Meskoutine</b> (1312 ft.; *Hôtel des Bains;
R. 5–6, B. 1½, déj. 3½, D. 4, pens. 14, motor-omn. 1¼–1½ fr.,
open 15th Nov. to June), the Roman <i>Aquae Thibilitanae</i>, is now one
of the most noted baths in Algeria. The ‘indifferent’ springs are
strongly impregnated with chloride of sodium and sulphate of lime;
one, containing iron, has a temperature of 187° Fahr., the others
226°. The latter form the *<i>Grande Cascade</i>, 5 min. from the
station, on the way to the hotel, falling over a terrace of calc-sinter
42 ft. high, a miniature edition of the terraces of Yellowstone Park,
or of Hierapolis (in Asia Minor). Below the terrace rise date-palms
and splendid olive-trees, while the bed of the <i>Oued Chedakra</i> with
its profusion of oleanders further enhances the peculiar charm of
the scene. The curious limestone cones, a few paces to the E., relics
of old eruptions, have given rise to the Arabian legend of the
petrified wedding party, from which the place derives its name
(‘Baths of the Petrified’). Smaller springs rise beyond these cones
and also 3 min. to the E., near the railway.</p>

<p class='c011'>Enclosed by the houses of the bath-hotel is a charming <i>Garden
Court</i>, with orange and lemon trees. Most curious among the numerous
Roman antiquities (stelæ, funerary inscriptions, etc.) placed
here is the house-altar of the Antistii, from Thibilis (see below),
on the S. terrace, shaded by a venerable terebinth. The ruined
<i>Piscinae</i> are the only relics of Roman buildings.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> To the S.W. lies the (¾ hr.) <i>Lac Souterrain</i>, a pond
88 ft. deep, in a cavern formed in 1878 by a landslip. In sunshine (best
2–4 p.m.) the water assumes a beautiful blue colour.—To the S., a little
aside from the lake just mentioned, we may ride on mule-back, or walk,
viâ <i>Aïn-St. Charles</i> and <i>Aïn-Amara</i> (see above) to (2 hrs.) <i>Announa</i>, the
Roman <b>Thibilis</b>, lying on a narrow hill (ca. 2300 ft.), high above the
<i>Announa Valley</i>, where excavations have been made since 1905. We note
specially the <i>East Gate</i>, the <i>Entrance Arch</i> of the forum, vestiges of
the <i>Market Basilica</i>, the house of <i>Magister Pagus</i>, and the sadly ruined
<i>South Gate</i>, the only two-arched Roman gateway in Algeria. Outside the
late-Byzantine town-walls, on the S.W. side of the little town, is the
<i>Byzantine Basilica</i> built of fragments of Roman buildings; in the semicircular
choir-recess are five rows of seats for the clergy, with the bishop’s
place in the centre.—A new road (carr. 12 fr.) leads to the N.W. to
(9½ M.) the ancient Berber <i>Necropolis of Roknia</i>, on the W. slope of
<i>Jebel Debar</i> (3442 ft.), with many dolmens (p. <a href='#Page_324'>324</a>) and rock-tombs, sadly
damaged of late.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>The train next makes a wide bend to the S., round the wooded
hills of the <i>Beni Addi</i>, past the influx of the <i>Oued Cherf</i> into the
Bou Hamdan, which now takes the name of <i>Seybouse</i>. 72 M.
<i>Medjez-Amar</i> (958 ft.), amid fine hill scenery.</p>

<p class='c011'>80 M. <b>Guelma</b> (916 ft.; Hôt. d’Orient, Rue Sadi-Carnot, tolerable;
Hôt. de l’Univers; pop. 10,200), a pleasant little town, in a
broad olive-clad basin, was founded on the site of <i>Calama</i>, in 1836,
when the <i>Byzantine Town Walls</i> of the time of Solomon (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>)
were partly used to build the French camp. The striking ruins of
the Roman <i>Thermae</i> (2nd cent. A. D.), with walls still about 33 ft.
high, and the <i>Jardin Public</i>, with Roman antiquities, are worth
seeing. There is a small collection of antiquities also at the <i>Mairie</i>.
The restoration of the <i>Roman Theatre</i> was begun in 1907 but
never finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Guelma holds the greatest <i>Cattle Market</i> in E. Algeria (Mondays;
chief of all, last Sunday in April). The poor-looking oxen,
mostly light-grey, of the E. districts as far as the Tunisian frontier,
are known as Guelma cattle.</p>

<p class='c016'>An interesting excursion may be made from Guelma by carriage
(12 fr. whole day) to <i>Thibilis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_307'>307</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>As the train proceeds, we have a fine view, to the right, of
<i>Jebel Mahouna</i> (4630 ft.), often snow-clad in winter. 82½ M.
<i>Millésimo</i> (755 ft.); 86 M. <i>Petit</i>, amidst pleasant wooded hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>93 M. <i>Nador</i> (430 ft.), with the poor huts of the natives half-hidden
by cactus-hedges, is the station for the zinc-mines on <i>Jebel
Nador</i> (2418 ft.), owned by the Vieille-Montagne Company.—We
next traverse the <i>Gorges du Nador</i>, clad with underwood.</p>

<p class='c011'>101 M. <b>Duvivier</b> (312 ft.; Rail. Restaur.; Hôt. Lagarde,
poor; pop. 2000), below the mouth of the <i>Oued Melah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_312'>312</a>),
junction for Bona, Souk-Ahras (Tunis, Tebessa; RR. 49–51).</p>

<p class='c011'>Our line now runs to the N. through the Seybouse valley.
103½ M. <i>Boudaroua</i>, 105½ M. <i>Oued-Frarah</i>, 110 M. <i>St. Joseph</i>,
all on the W. border of the wooded hills of the <i>Beni Salah</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the right, just before (117 M.) <i>Barral</i>, is the new reservoir
of the <i>Canal d’Irrigation de la Seybouse</i>. The chief branch of
the conduit runs on the left bank through the plain of Bona. A
minor branch, along with the highroad, crosses to the right bank,
below the picturesque village, by the iron <i>Pont de Barral</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now enter the <i>Plaine de Bône</i>, the broad, largely marshy
flats of the Seybouse, a picture of luxuriant fertility in spring, with
their extensive vineyards, flower-carpeted meadows, tall aloes, and
picturesque clumps of trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>120½ M. <i>Mondovi</i> (72 ft.; Hôt. Honorati), the agricultural

<p class='c009'><i>Bona</i>, French <i>Bône</i>, Arabic <i>Enneba</i> (pop. 42,900, incl. 28,300
Europeans, mostly French, 11,200 Mohammedans, and 1700 Jews),
on the W. side of the <i>Gulf of Bona</i> (p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>), a fortified town, is
the chief seaport of Algeria after Oran and Algiers and the most
important outlet for the produce of the département of Constantine,
such as phosphates (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>), iron (comp. pp. <a href='#Page_310'>310</a>, 314), zinc, cork,
cattle, and cereals. Besides its fine harbour, the town offers no
sights; but it deserves a visit especially in winter, for the sake of
its pretty situation at the foot of <i>Jebel Edough</i> (3307 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>),
not far from the picturesque <i>Cap de Garde</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bona lies on the small <i>Anse du Cassarin</i>, about 1¼ M. to the N.E.
of <i>Hippo</i>, which was one of the chief Phœnician colonies on the coast
of N. Africa. Under Masinissa (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>) Hippo was the capital of Numidia,
and under the Roman empire, when it was called <i>Hippo Regius</i>, it was the
richest port on the N. coast next to Carthage and rivalled Cæsarea (p. <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Here in 393 met a council of over three hundred bishops, who for the first
time recognized the present canon of the New Testament. On that occasion
St. Augustine (born in 354 at Thagaste, p. <a href='#Page_313'>313</a>), attended as a presbyter
and co-bishop. Chief among the four ‘Latin fathers’ and a keen
opponent of the Donatists (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), St. Augustine, after his conversion
at Milan by St. Ambrose (387), settled at Hippo, where he was bishop
from 395 to 430, and died there during the siege of the town by the
Vandals. After its destruction by Genseric and the downfall of the
Vandals, whose king Gelimer (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) sought his last asylum on Mt.
Edough, Hippo arose from its ruins once more under the Byzantines, but
it succumbed to the assaults of the Arabs in 697 and was thenceforth
entirely abandoned.</p>

<p class='c022'>The present town of <i>Bona</i>, founded later by the Arabs on the slope
of the Kasba hill, was seized by the Genoese in the 15th cent. for the
sake of its valuable coral-fishery. After the conquest of Tunis (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>),
it was occupied for a short time by the Spaniards in 1535, and afterwards
temporarily by the Compagnie d’Afrique from Marseilles. In 1837,
soon after the entry of the French (1832), the old Kasba, built under
Charles V., was blown up, and since then the native quarter has been
modernized in French fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<b>Harbour</b>, which has been so improved of late years as
to rival that of Algiers, consists of three basins. The <i>Petite Darse</i>
(Pl. B, C, 3), 27 acres in area, the old inner harbour, lies near the
railway-stations and the mouth of the <i>Seybouse</i>; the <i>Grande Darse</i>
(Pl. C, D, 3, 2; formerly the outer harbour), 170 acres in area, is
a new basin between the <i>Môle Cigogne</i> (Pl. C, 3) and the small creek
of <i>Grenouillère</i> (sea-baths); the <i>Avant-Port</i> is a new outer basin of
nearly 100 acres adjoining the <i>Pointe du Lion</i>. The outer entrance
to the harbour, 270 yds. wide, between the <i>Jetée du Lion</i>, 1200 yds.
long, and the <i>Jetée Sud</i> (Pl. C, D, 4, 3), 1800 yds. long, is difficult
of access during N. or N.E. gales. The inner entrances, through
the <i>Jetée Babayaud</i> and at the <i>Môle Cigogne</i> (see above), are only
77 yds. wide. The Quai Nord (Pl. B, C, 3) in the Petite Darse is
for the large French passenger-steamers, the Quai Ouest (Pl. B, 3)
for phosphate, and the Quai Sud (Pl. B, C, 4) for the iron-ore from
the mine near Aïn-Daliah (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>). Adjoining the last quay and
bordering the new reclaimed lands (82 acres) is the new <i>Quai aux
Phosphates</i> (Pl. C, D, 3, 4), to be used for the phosphate depots and
for the Ouenza iron ores (comp. p. <a href='#Page_314'>314</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The broad <span class='sc'>Cours Jérôme-Bertagna</span> (Pl. B, 2, 3; formerly
<i>Cours National</i>), the main street of the town, with the pretty
grounds of the ‘Square’, skirts the W. side of the native quarter.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W., in the European quarter, are the covered <i>Marché</i>
(Pl. B, 2), the interesting <i>Fondouk</i> (Pl. 1, A 2; native market),
and, in the Boul. des Jujubiers, the <i>Marché aux Grains</i> (Pl. A, 3).</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the W. gates, Porte des Karézas (Pl. A, 3) and Porte
Randon (Pl. A, 1), are the <i>Marché aux Bestiaux</i> (Pl. A, 2; Thurs.)
and the grounds of the <span class='sc'>Square Randon</span> (Pl. A, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Native Quarter</span>, where also the Jews reside, is intersected
by the Rue St. Augustin (Pl. B, C, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>From the Boul. Victor-Hugo (Pl. B, C, 2), on the N. side of this
quarter, we may mount in 10 min. to the <b>Colline de la Kasba</b>,
or <i>Colline des Santons</i> (358 ft.), crowned by the <i>Kasba</i> (Pl. C,
D, 1; no admittance). The pine-clad slope is skirted by the pretty
<i>Boul. des Caroubiers</i> (Pl. C, D, 2, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>A beautiful walk may be taken from the Porte des Caroubiers
(Pl. D, 1) on the busy *<b>Chemin de la Corniche</b>, round the E.
side of the <i>Batterie du Lion</i>, always skirting the shore and passing
many villas with luxuriant gardens. It leads to the N.W. to the
suburb of (2½ M.) <i>St Cloud-les-Plages</i>, on the <i>Baie des Caroubiers</i>,
with its sea-baths (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>). In clear weather a pleasant drive may
be taken past the little <i>Baie des Corailleurs</i> and the old <i>Fort
Génois</i> to (7 M.) the <i>Cap de Garde</i>. At the <i>Semaphore</i> (519 ft.),
above the lighthouse, we enjoy a delightful view of the bay.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the <i>Faubourg Ste. Anne</i> (Pl. A, 1) a hill-road with fine views,
but almost shadeless as far as the (5 M.) <i>Col des Chacals</i> (1578 ft.), ascends
in windings to (9 M.) <b>Bugeaud</b> (2809 ft.; Hôt. Fuster, Hôt. Kittler,
Hôt. Cronstadt, etc.), a favourite summer resort, beautifully situated among
woods of cork-oaks. In clear weather the *Panorama from (1½ hr.) <i>Kef
Seba</i> (3307 ft.), the summit of Mt. Edough, embraces the whole coast from
the bay of Stora (p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>) to the Kroumirie (p. <a href='#Page_326'>326</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The dusty Route de Constantine (Pl. A, 4) leads through the S.
town-gate to a (12 min.) <i>Bridge</i> the foundations of which are Roman,
spanning the <i>Oued Boudjimah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>). Between this brook and
the <i>Seybouse</i>, whose mouth once lay farther to the S.E. and was
used as a harbour, extended the site of <b>Hippo Regius</b> (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>).
The road straight on, beyond the bridge, leads to the (ca. 5 min.)
<i>Fortin</i>, which together with the castle-hill (see below) formed the
nucleus of the Roman town. Here once lay the Roman villa quarter.
Excavations in the former <i>Jardin Chevillot</i> (adm. 50 c.), now belonging
to the town, have brought to light several Roman columns and
mosaics (Apollo and the Muses, Triumph of Amphitrite, etc.), the
foundations of a small early-Christian basilica, and notably a fragment
of wall, about 22 yds. long, composed of enormous blocks of
granite, 10–13 ft. long, 39 in. thick, and 27 in. high. This last is
probably the oldest and most interesting specimen of Phœnician
building in Barbary. In the adjoining property of <i>Mme. Dufour</i>
part of the foundations of a Roman villa and superb mosaics have
been laid bare. Among the latter are a very lifelike representation
of a hunt, fishing-scenes, houses of a town, etc. (admission kindly
granted). Of the <i>Ancient Theatre</i> a few steps only now exist.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the right, just beyond the Boudjimah bridge (see above),
diverges the Chemin de Beleliéta, whence after 9 min. a fine road
leads to the right to the old <span class='sc'>Castle Hill</span> (181 ft.). On its slope lie
the <i>Roman Cisterns</i> of Hippo, resembling in plan those of Bordj
el-Djedid (p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>), but modernized in 1893 for the waterworks of
Bona (small fee for admittance). As Lalla Bouna, a famous saint,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>is supposed to have been buried here, the spot attracts Mohammedan
pilgrims on Fridays, when they may be seen picturesquely grouped
round the bronze <i>Statue of St. Augustine</i> (1843).</p>

<p class='c011'>The castle-hill is crowned with the handsome <i>Basilica of St.
Augustine</i>, founded by Card. Lavigerie (p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>), and built by Abbé
Pougnet in 1885–1900 in a semi-Oriental style, on the model of
the cathedral of Carthage (p. <a href='#Page_347'>347</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span> is unfinished. Over the high-altar is preserved a highly-revered
relic of St. Augustine, whose bones were carried in 496, during the
Vandal period, by fugitive Catholic bishops to Sardinia, whence they were
removed to Pavia by the Longobard king Liutprand in 722. In front of
the church we have a fine view of the coast, with its dunes, as far as
Cape Rosa (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We cross the <i>Seybouse</i> and follow the narrow dale of the <i>Oued
Melah</i> to the S.E., with its fine growth of underwood. 107½ (or
40½) M. <i>Medjez-Sfa</i> (476 ft.); the village (758 ft.) lies to the
right, on the Souk-Ahras road. We then mount to (113 or 46 M.)
<i>Aïn-Tahamimine</i> (about 1100 ft.), with its eucalyptus groves.</p>

<p class='c011'>The finest part of the line lies between this point and Laverdure.
We cross the ravine of the <i>Oued Cherf</i> by a viaduct. 116 (or 49) M.
<i>Aïn-Affra</i> (1739 ft.). We ascend the hill-side to the N.E., partly
through plantations of young cork-trees and underwood, and then on
the crest of the hill turn sharply back to the S.W. Below lies the
line just traversed. At several points we obtain a splendid view of
the distant hills of the <i>Beni Salah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_308'>308</a>). Among the cork-trees
appear the first evergreen oaks.</p>

<p class='c011'>124 (or 57) M. <i>Laverdure</i> (2369 ft.). The village (2526 ft.;
Hôt. Arena; Hôt. Raschiero), 1 M. to the W., on the Souk-Ahras
road, with its woods and beautiful views, attracts summer visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the left appears <i>Jebel Mahabouba</i> (4144 ft.), often snow-clad
in winter. Passing through woods of cork and evergreen oak,
fringes of the <i>Forêt de Fedj el-Makta</i>, we come to the <i>Col de Fedj
el-Makta</i> (tunnel), the watershed between the Seybouse and the
Medjerda (p. <a href='#Page_325'>325</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>127 (or 60) M. <i>Aïn-Sennour</i> (2552 ft.). The forest-zone is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>succeeded by a region of meadows, fields, and vineyards. To the
left we sight the bare mountains to the N. of Souk-Ahras.</p>

<p class='c016'>134 (or 66½) M. <b>Souk-Ahras.</b>—<i>Railway Restaurant.</i>—<span class='sc'>Hotels.</span>

<p class='c009'><i>Souk-Ahras</i> (2297 ft.; pop. 9000) lies very prettily in a lofty,
undulating plain enclosed by distant hills. It is a rapidly rising
place, with quite a European aspect, and is one of the pleasantest
provincial towns in Algeria. It dates only from 1852, when it was
founded as a convenient centre for roads radiating to Constantine,
Bona, and La Calle, and as a mart for the phosphates of Tebessa
(p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>). It stands on the site of <i>Thagaste</i>, the birthplace of St. Augustine
(p. <a href='#Page_310'>310</a>), who mentions it with affection in his Confessions.
At the foot of the old castle-hill, an excellent point of view, are
placed a few antiquities from Khamissa (see below). Cattle-breeding
and vine-culture are the chief industries in the environs.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to Khamissa</span>, about 23 M. from Souk-Ahras, is best
made by motor-car as far as Ksar Tifech and thence on mule-back. We
follow the Sedrata highroad to the S.W., soon crossing the <i>Medjerda</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_325'>325</a>). About halfway we enter the <i>Plaine de Tifech</i>, watered by the
Oued Tifech and once fertile and populous. We then reach the <i>Ksar Tifech</i>
(3150 ft.), on the slope of <i>Jebel Tifech</i> (3609 ft.), with the ruins of a
Byzantine fortress, the most considerable relic of the Numidian <i>Tipasa</i>.
Thence we ride to the N.W., in the direction of the ancient Roman road,
to *<b>Khamissa</b> or <i>Khemissa</i> (3084 ft.; no inn), the interesting site of
the Roman <i>Thubursicum Numidarum</i>, one of the oldest and most important
towns in Inner Numidia. It lies on a hill high above the valley
of the Medjerda, which rises a little to the N.W. on the <i>Râs el-Alia</i>
(4321 ft.). Among the ruins may be noted the <i>S.E. Gate</i>, a triumphal
arch with a single passage, on the Tipasa road; near it, the underground
<i>Columbarium</i> (hypogæum); the <i>Thermae</i>; and also, in the Platea Vetus,
the chief square in the E. quarter of the town, an unfinished <i>Roman
Temple</i> besides other buildings. On the crest of the hill we come upon
the foundations of a <i>Byzantine Basilica</i> and a small <i>Byzantine Fortress</i>
(‘Ksar el-Kebîr’). On the N. hill-side is the <i>Roman Theatre</i>, with its
fairly preserved stage-building (comp. p. <a href='#Page_293'>293</a>). The <i>Forum</i>, on the W.
margin of the hill, and a <i>Triumphal Arch</i> with three passages were afterwards
incorporated with a second <i>Byzantine Fortress</i>. All around are
extensive <i>Burial Grounds</i>, some of them with rock-tombs.</p>

only. Morsott is preferable to Tebessa for night-quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Souk-Ahras</i>, see above. We cross the Tunis line (R. 51) by a viaduct,
and descend to the S. into the valley of the <i>Medjerda</i> (p. <a href='#Page_325'>325</a>),
latterly through underwood and Aleppo pines. 5 M. <i>Les Tuileries</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next ascend the narrow and picturesque side-valley of the
<i>Oued Chouk</i>, through pine and cork-oak woods. Beyond (9 M.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span><i>Oued-Chouk</i> (1975 ft.) we skirt the upper course of the stream,
now called <i>Oued el-Hammam</i>, in a barren hill-country, and at
places through limestone gorges, bordered with Aleppo pines.</p>

<p class='c011'>17½ M. <i>Dréa</i> (2634 ft.), an alfa (esparto grass) station.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Dréa we may visit the native village of <i>Mdaourouch</i> (3058 ft.),
3 M. to the S.E., on the N.W. slope of <i>Jebel Bou Sessou</i> (3566 ft.). This
was the ancient <b>Madaura</b> or <i>Madauros</i>, the birthplace (about 125 A. D.)
of the Roman author <i>L. Apuleius</i>. It was once the seat of a famous
school of oratory, at which St. Augustine (p. <a href='#Page_310'>310</a>) was educated. On its
site, where there are relics of a Roman <i>Mausoleum</i> and the foundations
of an early-Christian <i>Basilica</i>, rises the conspicuous <i>Byzantine Castle</i>,
dating from the time of Solomon (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>), a building curiously irregular
in plan, partly enclosed by later (Berber?) fortifications. Large <i>Thermae</i>
also have been recently excavated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Dréa we traverse fields and poor pastures to the S.W.</p>

<p class='c011'>22½ M. <i>Mdaourouch</i> (2809 ft.; no inn), the highest point on
the line, the watershed between the Medjerda and the Mellègue
(see below). In the vicinity is the village of <i>Montesquieu</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>A field-road leads to the E. from the station to (4½ M.) the village
of <i>Mdaourouch</i> (see above).</p>

<p class='c022'><i>Khamissa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_313'>313</a>) may be visited from Montesquieu (see above) or
Mdaourouch if we are fortunate enough to find mules there. We follow
the Sedrata highroad to the W. to (9 M.) the caravanserai (Bordj; 2756 ft.)
in the Plaine de Tifech (p. <a href='#Page_313'>313</a>), whence we turn to the N. to (13 M.)
<i>Ksar Tifech</i> (p. <a href='#Page_313'>313</a>) and thence go on to (16 M.) <i>Khamissa</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Mdaourouch there are long stretches of bleak steppe-like
country. The train descends to (30 M.) <i>Oued-Damous</i> (1982 ft.),
in the valley of that name. It then skirts the <i>Oued Kebarit</i> and
rounds the E. slope of <i>Jebel Kréréga</i> (3251 ft.), a tableland with
scanty woods of pine and arbor vitæ. Far away to the left rises
<i>Jebel Ouenza</i> (4229 ft.), with the largest iron-mines in Algeria,
owned by the ‘Société d’Etudes de l’Ouenza’. (Mineral-line to Bona
or to Nebeur projected; comp. p. <a href='#Page_325'>325</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>We now ascend the valley of the <i>Oued Mellègue</i>. To the right
appear the bare <i>Kef Bou Djabeur</i> (2504 ft.) and <i>Kef Raghma</i>
(2700 ft.), similar in type to the hills fringing the Sahara.</p>

<p class='c011'>38 M. <b>Clairefontaine</b> (2146 ft.; Buffet, D. 3 fr., very fair),
an important alfa station, with artesian wells. Sunday market.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing between <i>Jebel Mestoula</i> (3488 ft.) on the right and
<i>Jebel el-Dzeroua</i> (3432 ft.) on the left, we enter, to the S.E., the
valley of the <i>Oued Chabrou</i>. To the S., above the steppe, which is
overgrown with alfa and enlivened by browsing camels, rise the
ranges of <i>Jebel Metloug</i> (4111 ft.) and <i>Jebel Mzouzia</i> (4514 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>60 M. <b>Morsott</b> (2559 ft.; Hôt. de Lyon or Sivignon, good
cuisine), below <i>Jebel Hout es-Srir</i> (3445 ft.), a thriving European
settlement, with its Monday market and alfa trade, is the starting-point
of the mineral-line to (9½ M.) <i>Jebel Bou Kadra</i> (4734 ft.)
and the iron-mines of the Mokta el-Hadid Company (p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Here, partly seen from the train, are relics of the Roman <i>Vasampus</i>:
a <i>Gateway</i> of solid masonry, perhaps that of a temple-court; <i>Thermae</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>with unusually small chambers; and two <i>Mausolea</i>. There are also remains
of the foundations of an early-Christian <i>Basilica</i>, curiously planned,
40½ by 16¾ yds. (three portals to the nave, apse with four side-recesses,
baptistery behind the choir-recess).</p>

of the mineral-line to the phosphate-beds of <i>Jebel Dyr</i> (4977 ft.).
On the right rises the ‘<i>Chapeau de Gendarme</i>’ (4393 ft.; Arabic
<i>Jebel bel-Khifeh</i>), whose characteristic form we do not see until
near Tebessa. A line of rails to the left leads to the phosphate-deposits
of <i>Aïn-Kissa</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the foreground appear the hills of Tebessa, to the S. <i>Jebel

<p class='c022'>A hasty visit to the sights, in the following order, takes 2–3 hrs.—For
the description of Tebessa comp. also <i>Cagnat’s</i> book mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Tebessa</i> (2717 ft.; pop. 5700, mostly Mohammedans), a poor
town, now unimportant except as the centre of the E. Algerian phosphate
trade, was the ancient <i>Theveste</i>, one of the most prosperous
towns in Inner Numidia from the Punic period (about B.C. 250–200)
onwards. It was the first headquarters of the Third Legion (p. <a href='#Page_286'>286</a>);
in 123 A. D. it was connected with Carthage by a Roman military
road; and after its destruction by the Berbers it was re-founded in
535 by Solomon, the general of Justinian (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>). Its ruins of
the late-Roman and Vandal periods are among the finest in Barbary,
but as they lie off the beaten track they are almost forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town is still enclosed by the <b>Byzantine Walls</b> built by
Solomon, forming a rectangle of 350 by 306 yds., with fourteen
towers, two gates, and a sally-port on the S. side. The old upper
gallery and the battlements were removed in 1852 when the walls
were restored.</p>

<p class='c011'>The modern W. Gate, the Porte de Constantine, leads first to the
pleasant <span class='sc'>Place d’Armes</span>, the centre of traffic. Two minutes’ walk
to the E. of this is the so-called <i>Porte de Solomon</i>, the most interesting
part of the fortifications, with a round-arched passage and
two square towers 56 ft. high. Outside of it the natives hold market
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</p>

<p class='c011'>The N. Gate, where the walls project a little on both sides, is
formed by the *<b>Arch of Caracalla</b>, dating from 214 A. D., once
in the middle of the far more populous Roman town, but now at
the end of the main street coming from the Place d’Armes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>This arch, resembling the Janus Quadrifrons at Rome, is the most
imposing Roman monument of the kind in Algeria, rivalling those of
Tripoli (p. <a href='#Page_408'>408</a>) and Leptis Magna (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>). It forms a square of about
12 yds. each way, with four round-arched passages, 27 ft. high and 15 ft.
wide. Each pillar is adorned on its two outer sides with two Corinthian
pilasters and two projecting Corinthian columns, all on a common base.
Of the sculptures on the keystones of the archways, under the lavishly
decorated architrave, there are preserved, on the E. side, a medallion in
high relief of Minerva and a Medusa, and on the W. side a Fortuna (goddess
of the town) and an eagle holding a bundle of thunderbolts. On three
sides, in the middle of the attica, which is 4 ft. high, there are Latin
inscriptions referring to Caracalla and his parents, Septimius Severus and
Julia Domna. On the N. side, when the arch was restored, there was added
an inscription in honour of Solomon. On the S. side is still preserved an
ædicula, one of the four destined for statues adjoining the central dome.
On the inner side of two of the pillars are long inscriptions from the
testament of C. Cornelius Egrilianus, the builder of the triumphal arch.</p>

<p class='c009'>The highroad now descends to the N. to the (7 min.) so-called
**<b>Basilica</b>, the most remarkable early-Christian ruin in Algeria,
still in some respects an enigma to archæologists. Built mainly of
Roman materials, and itself used for centuries as a quarry, it still
forms an immense quadrilateral of about 213 by 88–115 yds.,
systematically excavated for the first time in 1888–92. The oldest
parts of the edifice, perhaps of the late 4th cent., are believed to
be the basilica and the memorial chapel; the main street, the court,
and the ‘stable’ seem to belong to a second building period, perhaps
also prior to the Vandal era. The monastery, with its fortifications,
and the additions to the memorial chapel date probably from the
Vandal period; the small ‘emergency chapel’ is perhaps a later
Byzantine addition. The custodian (fee ½–1 fr.) is to be found at
the little house near the E. gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>E. Gate</i>, the old main entrance, once adorned externally,
in the style of a Roman triumphal arch, with Corinthian pilasters
and jutting columns, is in fair preservation. Thence ran the paved
<i>Main Street</i>, 8 yds. wide, without wheel-ruts, past the Basilica
on the right and the court and ‘stable’ on the left, to the <i>W. Gate</i>,
the ancient subsidiary entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the N. side of the main street, formerly flanked with three
colonnades, a flight of fourteen steps, 9½ ft. high in all, ascends
to the portico of the <span class='sc'>Basilica</span>, which was once preceded by eight
columns. Three portals here opened into the Atrium, the square
forecourt of the church, with remains of the <i>Cantharus</i>, or fountain
of purification, in the centre. Near the entrance-wall are two side-rooms
whence winding staircases ascended to the upper floor and
the church galleries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Church, built of solid masonry, consisted of nave and two
aisles, 50 by 24 yds. in all; but now nothing remains save the
external wall of the left aisle, two arcades of the nave, and the
choir-recess. The formation of the arcades, with low pillars and
Corinthian columns in front, is peculiar. The site of the choirscreen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>and of the base of the altar is still traceable. Of the galleries,
supposed to have been added on the occasion of a restoration
of the church, there still lie fragments of the columns and
imposts all around. The mosaic pavement is covered with earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the front part of the right aisle twelve steps descend into
an almost square outer building (25½ by 22 yds.), contemporaneous
with the church. The middle of this is occupied by the
Trichorum, a trefoil-shaped hall, with three rounded apses, probably
a <span class='sc'>Memorial Chapel</span>, resembling the early-Christian cemetery-chapels,
and dedicated to some martyr or bishop buried under the
altar. The four corner-rooms served as <i>Tomb Chambers</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Among the later additions of the Vandal period are the <i>Square
Chamber</i> on the S. side of the memorial chapel, which also was used as
a burial-place, with its small ante-room, and the <i>Baptistery</i>, accessible
only from the atrium by three steps, containing remains of the old font.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the same period belong the other additions to the basilica. Extending
round the church from the memorial chapel on the E. to the W.
side of the atrium are twenty-seven square chambers, partly built of
heathen tombstones, commonly supposed to have been the <i>Monks’ Cells</i>,
though unusually large for that purpose. Between these and the castellated
<i>Monastery Wall</i>, whose towers do not project externally in the
usual Byzantine fashion, probably lay the <i>Monastery Garden</i>, which was
used down to the Moorish period as a burial-ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>Lastly we note the small ‘<i>Emergency Chapel</i>’ on the N. side of the
memorial chapel, a small church, probably hastily built subsequent to
the irruption of the Berbers (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>), with nave and two aisles, portico,
choirscreen, rounded apse, and a square sacristy added on the N. side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Quadrangle</span>, 60 by 46 yds., on the S. side of the main
street, formerly called the forum, was once divided into four sections
by two cross-ways bordered by marble balustrades. In spite of the
unevenness of the ground these sections are supposed to have been
basins (watering-places for cattle and horses?), the water being
supplied from the square reservoir still existing at the S.E. corner
of the quadrangle. From the cross-ways steps ascended to narrow
terraces enclosing the quadrangle on three sides, that on the S. side
being a porticus of twenty-two columns.</p>

<p class='c011'>More enigmatical still is the <span class='sc'>West Building</span>, 53 by 24 yds., a
hall with three aisles borne by pillars. This was afterwards converted,
by the insertion of two low partitions, into a central chamber
of three aisles with eleven two-storied side-rooms on each
side of the outer aisles. The curious stone boxes or troughs (mangers?)
on the partitions, together with the holes in the walls, of a
kind that recur in many Byzantine buildings (perhaps for the
rings to which horses were attached), have led to the conjecture
that the building was a stable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small building behind the <i>Porticus</i> of six columns on the
N. side of the main street, opposite the so-called stables, contains
similar stone boxes.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Kubba Sidi Djaballah</i>, about 5 min. to the N. of the Basilica,
near the Catholic cemetery, is a Roman mausoleum with a Moorish dome.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>On the way back to the town we call at the <i>Bureau des Ponts
et Chaussées</i>, on the right, a little off the road, 2 min. before the
Arch of Caracalla, to ask M. Coggia, the curator, for the key of
the museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>The so-called *<b>Temple of Minerva</b>, the best-preserved Roman
temple in Algeria, now used as a museum, dates from the 3rd
cent. A.D. The only relic of the old temple-court is the gateway
wall, adorned with Corinthian pilasters, now forming the façade of a
zaouïa (Mohammedan school) in the main street, close to the Arch
of Caracalla. The temple, a pseudo-peripteros of 19¾ by 10 yds., on
a substructure 13 ft. high, is in a side-street, adjoining the N. town-wall.
A new flight of twelve (once twenty) steps ascends to the portico,
with four Corinthian columns in front. The structure of the
temple shows many of the peculiarities of African provincial art. Instead
of an architrave there is a frieze with bulls’ skulls and eagles
grasping serpents; above it is an attica in similar style, overladen
with reliefs but without a cornice. Instead of a pediment there
was probably a flat terrace on the summit. The present roof and
the whole front-wall of the cella are modern.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <b>Town Museum</b> contains antiquities from Tebessa, Morsott, etc.
(catalogue for the use of visitors). In the court are relics of antique and
early-Christian buildings, inscriptions, altars, Saturn-stelæ and tomb-stelæ,
some of them with bowls on the pedestal for the repasts of the
deceased. The cella contains bronzes, vessels and sculptures in clay, etc.;
a sarcophagus with the Muses; two mosaics from the baths which were
removed to make way for the cavalry barracks, one with Nereids and
sea monsters, the other with a home-coming ship and numbered figures
of a game (bull, ostrich, gazelle, boar, etc.; comp. p. <a href='#Page_292'>292</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Catholic Church</b>, at the N.W. angle of the town-wall,
is adorned in the interior with a few fragments from the Basilica.
Thus, over the high-altar, are remains of an early-Christian sarcophagus
with three curious figures in relief (Christian Roma?).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Environs.</span> The <i>Roman Aqueduct</i>, 547 yds. long, restored in turn
by the Moors, the Turks, and the French, still conveys water from the
spring of <i>Aïn el-Bled</i>.—About 1¾ M. from the Porte de Constantine
(p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>) are the extensive late-Roman ruins of <i>Tebessa Khalia</i> (‘Old
Tebessa’), the nature of which is still unexplained.</p>

<p class='c022'>Diligence daily to (11 M.) <i>Youks-les-Bains</i> (2625 ft.), with ‘indifferent’
hot springs (95° Fahr.), 2 M. to the S.W. of the Meskiana and Aïn-Beïda
road (p. <a href='#Page_273'>273</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>To avoid the long return-journey from Tebessa to Souk-Ahras, we may
ride or drive to the N.W. viâ (26 M.) <i>Haidra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_362'>362</a>) to (40½ M.) <i>Thala</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_362'>362</a>) or to (37½ M.) rail. stat. <i>Kalaâ-Djerda</i> (p. <a href='#Page_362'>362</a>). A mineral-line
also runs thence to the Algerian frontier and the phosphate-beds on <i>Jebel
Kouif</i> (3871 ft.; leave to travel by it is usually granted by the manager).</p>

<p class='c022'>A road leads to the S.W., past <i>Jebel Osmor</i> (5052 ft.), noted for its
Punic rock-tombs, then across the <i>Tenoukla Pass</i>, between <i>Jebel Tenoukla</i>
(5118 ft.) on the right and <i>Jebel Bou Roumane</i> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>) on the left, and

<p class='c009'><i>Tunisia</i>, the eastmost part of the <i>Maghreb</i> (p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>), a territory
of about 50,000 sq. M., has a population of ca. 1½–2 millions,
the great majority being Mohammedans (Berbers, Arabs, Moors,
Kuluglis, and negroes). Of the remainder about 60,000 are Jews
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>(Arabic <i>Ihûdi</i>, pl. <i>Ihûd</i>), either natives or settlers (from Spain and
the so-called Livornese), 105,680 Italians, 40,850 French, 12,200
Maltese (p. <a href='#Page_397'>397</a>), and 4800 other Europeans. The coast, about 620 M.
long, extends from <i>Cape Roux</i> (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>) to <i>Râs Adjir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The abrupt coast of the <i>Tell Atlas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), which stretches
from the <i>Fedja Grandpré</i> (3783 ft.) on the Algerian frontier to
<i>Cape Blanc</i> (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>), and comprises the wooded hill-country of
the <i>Kroumirie</i>, the <i>Nefza</i> and <i>Mogod Mts.</i>, and several ranges of
lower heights, is broken by the small coast-plain of <i>Tabarca</i> alone.
The dunes to the E. of Bizerta, rising to 1033 ft., the greatest
range of sand-hills on the Mediterranean, separate the <i>Lake of Bizerta</i>
from the <i>Gulf of Tunis</i> (p. xxx), into which fall the <i>Medjerda</i>
and the <i>Oued Miliane</i>, the two chief rivers of the country,
forming a number of lagoons and tongues of land at their mouths.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Algerian <i>Sahara Atlas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>) extends to the N.E. from
<i>Jebel Bou Roumane</i> (5250 ft.) and <i>Jebel Zebissa</i> (4167 ft.) near
Tebessa (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>) to <i>Cape Bon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_153'>153</a>), broken by stony plateaux
(<i>Hammada</i>, <i>Kalaâ</i>, <i>Dyr</i>), and finally descends abruptly to the sea.
Its most important peaks in Tunisia are <i>Jebel Chambi</i> (5217 ft.),
<i>Jebel Bireno</i> (4655 ft.), <i>Jebel Rekaba</i> (or <i>Râs Ali Bou-Mouzine</i>,
4987 ft.), <i>Jebel Serd</i> (4511 ft.), and, beyond the deep depression
of <i>Jebel Faroua</i> (2362 ft.), <i>Jebel Zaghouan</i> (4249 ft.), which
last is the most striking landmark for mariners in all Tunisia.
The S. slope of the Sahara Atlas is remarkable for its terraced
formation due to the action of water. The whole country consists
mainly of great basins with floors of clay or sand of recent origin,
separated from each other by elliptically shaped hills of more solid
rock, chiefly of chalk formation. The <i>Oued Hathob</i> (pp. <a href='#Page_362'>362</a>, 370)
flows through no fewer than six basins of the kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the <i>Gulf of Hammamet</i>, on the S. margin of the peninsula
of Cape Bon, to the <i>Lesser Syrtis</i>, now the <i>Gulf of Gabes</i>, extends
an alluvial plain of marine formation. This steppe-like tract,
with its large fresh-water lake (<i>Lac de Kelbia</i>, p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>) and many
salt-marshes (<i>Sebkha</i>, comp. p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), is thinly peopled by nomads
only, except on the strip of coast, with its lagoons, flanking the <i>Sahel</i>.
To the W. of the Gulf of Gabes lies the region, 250 M. long, of the
<i>Shotts</i> (<i>Chotts el-Fedjedj</i>, <i>Djerid</i>, and <i>Rharsa</i>), belonging to the
great <i>Bassin du Melrir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_170'>170</a>); it forms the N. fringe of the desert,
lying largely below the sea-level, and contains the finest palm-oases
in Barbary. The transition from the shotts to the highlands
of Tripoli is formed by <i>Jebel Tebaga</i> (1608 ft.), and by the <i>Monts
des Ksour</i> (2460 ft.), famed ever since the time of Herodotus for
their troglodytes or cave-dwellers, and bounded on the S.W. by
the <i>Erg Oriental</i> (p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Tunisia, unlike its neighbour Algeria, which is shut in all round
by high mountains, covered with snow in winter, opens due E. upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the Mediterranean and enjoys a mild winter climate, but in summer
and autumn is directly exposed to the sirocco (Arabic <i>samûm</i>),
the burning wind from inland Africa, which is hotter and drier here
than in Algeria. The mean temperature of January is at Tunis 51°
Fahr. (minimum 28½°), at Aïn-Draham 42½° (min. 9½°), at Le Kef
45° (min. 23°), at Kairwan and Tozeur 50° (min. 25°), at Djerba
54½° (min. 35½°). The mean temperature of August at Tunis is
81° (maximum 122°), at Kairwan 85° (max. 120°), at Djerba 81°
(max. 115°), and at Tozeur reaches 91° (max. 120°). The greatest
rainfall in N. Africa is in the region of the Kroumirie (65 inches
per annum at Aïn-Draham); to the S. of the Medjerda it decreases
to 20–24 inches (at Le Kef 21½ in.); it is still lower at Tunis
(17¾ in.), on the E. coast (Susa 16½, Sfax 9¾ in.), and particularly
in the district of the shotts (at Tozeur 5 in.). The rain falls
in short, torrential showers; owing to the destruction of the forests
and the paucity of reservoirs the water rushes down unhindered to
the salt-lakes and the sea, inundating the plains on its way. A few
hours after each shower the thirsty soil is as dry as before, but the
devastation caused by erosion is aggravated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fauna and flora are almost identical with those of Algeria
(p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>). The chief products of Tunisia are the tanner’s bark and
cork of the Kroumirie, early vegetables from the environs of Tunis,
cereals from the Medjerda valley and from the dales of the Sahara
Atlas (here horse and cattle breeding also thrive), alfa or esparto
grass (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>), olive-oil from the Sahel and from Sfax, and dates
from the oases of the Sahara. Fish abound on the coast and the
sponge fishery also is productive, while the coral-fishing has sunk
into complete insignificance. The principal ores worked here are
zinc, lead, iron, and copper. At Kalaât es-Senam, Kalaâ-Djerda,
Metlaoui, Redeyef, and Aïn-Moularès there are immense deposits
of phosphate, the yield of which has rapidly increased the traffic
of <i>Tunis</i> and <i>Sfax</i>, and is expected greatly to augment that of
<i>Susa</i> after the completion of its harbour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tunisia owes its ancient culture, the earliest in Barbary, to its
numerous Phœnician colonies, such as Utica, Kambe, Hadrumetum
(Susa), Leptis Minor, and Carthage. The Carthaginians wisely
introduced the irrigation system of Mesopotamia into N. Africa
and promoted the corn and vine culture, but the agricultural prosperity
of the country was confined chiefly to the littoral, inhabited
by Libyan-Phœnicians, a mixed Berber and Phœnician race, and to
the valley of the Medjerda. The contiguous region of <i>Numidia</i> was
first opened up to Punic culture by <i>Masinissa</i> (B.C. 201–149), the
most distinguished of the ancient Berber kings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman republican period was unfavourable for the development
of the new province of <i>Africa</i>. The chief events were the
war with Jugurtha (111–106), the grandson of Masinissa, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>battles between Pompey, whose adherents were aided by Juba I.,
and Cæsar, which, after the battle of Thapsus (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), led to the
annexation of Numidia as the province of <i>Africa Nova</i>. The
marvellous progress of the country during the first centuries of the
Roman empire is evidenced by the colonization of the central
Tunisian and S. Algerian steppe, a triumph of Roman enterprise.
A great network of roads was constructed, chiefly from the reign
of Hadrian onwards, to connect Carthage, the new capital, and
other towns with Tebessa, Hippo Regius (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>), Tripolitania,
and even the distant Mauretania Tingitana (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), and numerous
towns were founded in the interior of Tunisia and Numidia. But
soon (about 238) a period of decline set in. Its causes were manifold.
The Berbers were constantly rebelling, the Roman soldiers
quarrelled, advancing Christianity and expiring paganism were
struggling fiercely for the mastery, and the Christians, at length
victorious, persecuted with the greatest ferocity. To add to these
troubles, the terrible peasant-war of the so-called Circumcelliones
broke out in the 4th cent., followed in the 4th and 5th cent. by
the religious wars between Catholics and Donatists.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more, however, the ancient glory of Tunisia revived, though
for but a brief period (439–77), under <i>Genseric</i>, the Arian king of
the Vandals. After he had completed his victorious expedition from
S. Spain to Carthage (429–39) he proceeded, in alliance with the
Donatist Berbers and with the still Punic speaking inhabitants of the
coast, to attack the effete western empire. With his newly formed
fleet he conquered Sicily (440), Rome (455), Tripolitania, Malta
(456), and Sardinia (458), and in 476, after the overthrow of the W.
Roman empire, was recognized by Zeno, the E. Roman emperor,
as lord of the whole western Mediterranean. But the incompetence
and intolerance of his successors soon shattered this new empire,
and in 533 king <i>Gelimer</i> was defeated by Justinian’s able general
<i>Belisarius</i>. Even in Justinian’s time, however, the new rulers were
incessantly attacked by the Berbers of the mountains, while the Byzantine
governors (534–698) persecuted Donatists and Arians alike,
with the result, according to Procopius’s estimate, that five millions
of the inhabitants of N. Africa perished. The fate of the country
was thus sealed and its conquest by Islam greatly facilitated.</p>

<p class='c011'>After eight successive campaigns (647–98) the first Arabian
governors (representing the caliphs), <i>Abdallah ibn Saâd</i>, <i>Moauya
ibn Hodeij</i>, <i>Sidi Okba ben-Nâfi</i> (founder of Kairwan, p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>),
<i>Zoheir ibn Kaïs</i>, and <i>Hassan ibn en-Nôman</i> (destroyer of Carthage,
p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>), drove the Byzantines out of ‘Ifrikia’ and overcame
the desperate resistance of the Berber mountaineers, thus sweeping
Christianity from African soil and destroying the last vestiges
of Punic and Roman culture. Ere long, however, their ineradicable
love of independence led the Berbers, who after the conquest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Andalusia (p. <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>) had formed the sect of the <i>Kharijites</i> and later
that of the <i>Shiites</i>, to unite in opposing the orthodox Arabs and
to found (about 740) several small states of their own, such as
that of the <i>Ibadites</i> in Tiaret (p. <a href='#Page_208'>208</a>) and that of the <i>Sofrites</i> in
Sijilmassa (Tafilet, p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>). In Tunisia the <i>Aglabides</i> (800–909),
a Berber dynasty, who were originally governors under Hârûn er-Rashid,
declared themselves independent, and in 827 they proceeded
to conquer Sicily. Under the <i>Fatimites</i>, who also were Berbers,
the seat of government was transferred in 916 from Kairwan to
Mehdia (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), and in 973, after the conquest of Egypt, it was
removed to Cairo (comp. p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>). The revolt of the <i>Zirites</i>, a new
dynasty of Tunisian governors, named after <i>Bologgîn ez-Ziri</i>, led
in 1045 to the fateful irruption of the <i>Beni Hilal</i> (<i>Hilalides</i>) and
<i>Beni Soleïm</i>, two marauding tribes of nomadic Arabs. At the instigation
of the Fatimites they overran Barbary like a swarm
of locusts, defeated the allied Zirites and Hammadites (p. <a href='#Page_270'>270</a>),
destroyed Kairwan and many other towns, demolished most of the
forests and the irrigation-works, and drove the Berbers back to
their mountains. After a time the Zirites partly succeeded in subduing
these hordes, but in 1148 the whole of the Sahel with its
capital Mehdia was wrested from them by the Normans of Sicily
(p. <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>). In 1160 the Normans were expelled by <i>Abd el-Mûmen</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), and Tunisia was incorporated with the great empire of
the Almohades. At length, under the <i>Hafsides</i> (1206–1573), Tunisia
regained independence, with Tunis as the capital. Towards the end
of this period troubles began anew. After interminable wars with
the Merinides (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>) Tunis was captured by Kheireddin (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>)
in 1534, and was attacked, though without permanent success, by
the crusading Maltese knights (p. <a href='#Page_398'>398</a>), by Emp. Charles V. (in
1535), by Juan de Vega (1551), and by Don John of Austria (1573).
From 1574 to 1650 Tunisia was governed by Turkish officials
(<i>pashas</i>, <i>deys</i>, <i>beys</i>), after which the dynasty of the <i>Husseinites</i>
was founded by <i>Hussein Ali ben-Turki</i>. From 1705 onwards
Tunisia, often only a nominal dependency of Turkey, degenerated
into a mere pirate-state, which down to 1830 took an active part in
the marauding expeditions of its barbaresque Algerian neighbours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since 1881 the French protectorate has paved the way for a
new period of prosperity and opened up the greatly impoverished
and thinly peopled country to European trade and culture. The
present bey is <i>Sidi Mohammed en-Nasr</i> (born in 1855). The
minister for foreign affairs is the French resident-general, and the
minister of war is the commandant of the French garrison. Finance,
postal arrangements, public works, and education are all superintended
by French officials, with whom are associated a Mohammedan
prime minister and a secretary of state. Europeans and their
dependents are under the jurisdiction of the French law-courts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the natives are dealt with by the courts of the Ouzara and the
‘Shaâra’. The bey is allowed a body-guard of 600 men of the
infantry, cavalry, and artillery, uniformed like the Zouaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lovers of art will find Tunisia a most attractive country. As
in Algeria and Morocco, so here also the megalithic monuments
(dolmens, basinas, etc.), built of huge blocks of stone, are the chief
memorials of the Libyan (or ancient Berber) culture. The Punic
art of Tunisia, at first under Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek influence,
but exclusively Greek after the first campaigns in Sicily,
has become better known of late, especially since the rich yield of
the rock-tombs of Carthage. Apart from the tomb at Dougga
(p. <a href='#Page_355'>355</a>), as little of Punic architecture remains as in Algeria. On
the other hand no other country can boast of such a profusion of
Roman ruins (called by the Mohammedans Henshir) as Tunisia.</p>

<p class='c011'>The early Moorish art of Tunisia, as in the whole of the Maghreb,
betrays the influence of Andalusian masters, but most of the buildings
are no earlier than the Turkish period. Contrary to their
Algerian methods the French have preserved the Oriental character
of the country, so that the seaports of the E. coast, Kairwan, and
the oasis villages still contain fine Moorish buildings.</p>

<p class='c016'>Travellers may explore any part of the country in safety and without
escort, but they should not enter Mohammedan burial-grounds or shrines
(comp. p. xxv). The only mosques and zaouïas open to Christians (but
not to Jews) are those of Le Kef, Kairwan, Gafsa, and Tozeur.</p>

<p class='c022'>The means of communication are similar to those in Algeria (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>). The network of <span class='sc'>Railways</span>, mostly belonging to the company of the
Chemins de Fer de Bône-Guelma (p. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>), extends to central Tunisia only.
Between Susa and Sfax (until the opening of the new railway) and
between Sfax or Graïba and Gabes the motor-omnibus or the diligence
(p. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>) is at present the only conveyance. The shotts are visited by carriage
from Metlaoui, or, if preferred, from Gabes. A visit to S.E. Tunisia
(Monts des Ksour, Gightis, Djerba) is usually paid from Gabes, where
introductions had better be obtained from the authorities of the Territoire
Militaire. Susa, Sfax, Gabes, and Djerba are also steamboat-stations
(comp. R. 64). In Tunisia mid-European time (1 hr. ahead of Greenwich
time), which is observed also on the Italian steamers, has recently been
introduced.</p>

<p class='c022'>First-class <span class='sc'>Hotels</span> are to be found in Tunis only. Those in country
places are similar to the Algerian (p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>), but still plainer and less up
to date, apart from a few creditable exceptions. In the steppe and on
the Sahara one must often have recourse to the fortified caravanserai or
to the hospitality of the local authorities.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Post Office</span> of the regency of Tunis has its own stamps (letter-postage
within Tunisia or to France 10, to Italy 20 c. etc.; post-cards 5 c.).
A passport visé by the consul must be shown in order to obtain delivery
of registered letters.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Coinage</span>, since the introduction of the gold standard (1891), has
been French, with Arabic and French inscriptions. The gold coins are
of 10 and 20 francs, the silver of ½, 1, and 2 francs, the copper of 5 and
10 centimes. Italian, Swiss, Belgian, and Greek silver coins (except 5 fr.
pieces) and copper coins are rejected. English or American money should
be exchanged for banknotes of the Banque de France or the Banque de
l’Algérie (p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>), or for gold of the Latin monetary union.</p>

(pp. <a href='#Page_313'>313</a>, 320), called by the Carthaginians <i>Makar</i>, and by the
Romans <i>Bagradas</i>, the most fertile and most important in Tunisia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond (5½ M.) <i>Tarja</i> (1611 ft.) the valley forms a short ravine.
10½ M. <i>Sidi-Bader</i>, in a meadowy dale, the future junction

<b>Bulla Regia</b>, the prosperous ancient capital of the Dakla in the
Carthaginian period, and in 203 the scene of Scipio’s victory over
Hasdrubal and Syphax. The village lies on a terrace on the S. slope
of <i>Jebel Rebia</i> (2123 ft.) and owes its modern name <i>Hammam-Darradji</i>
to its spring. Among the interesting Roman ruins are
the large *<i>Thermae</i>; a *<i>Nymphaeum</i>, or fountain; a <i>Temple of

only suitable for the warmer season, introduces us to the most
beautiful parts of the *<b>Kroumirie</b>, which, thanks to its ample rainfall
(p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>), is the most richly wooded region in Barbary. Now and then
we meet with an almost virgin forest of cork-trees, evergreen oaks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>elms, ashes, and other trees, in whose shade grow luxuriant ferns, while
babbling brooks refresh the wayfarer. It was owing to violations of the
frontier and thefts of cattle committed by the <i>Kroumirs</i> that the French
at length occupied Tunisia in 1881, but the natives are now peaceable
herdsmen, wood-cutters, and charcoal-burners. The tombs of this Berber
tribe still recall the ancient megalithic monuments of their ancestors.</p>

pop. 1300, of whom 1100 are Europeans; Frid. market), a quiet little
seaport in the fertile coast-plain between the Oued el-Kébir and <i>Cape
Tabarca</i>, was the Roman <i>Thabraca</i>, the busiest harbour on the coast-road
between Utica (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>) and Hippo Regius (p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>), the outlet for the
marble of Simitthu (p. <a href='#Page_326'>326</a>) and for the timber and the wild beasts of
the Kroumirie. Hardly a trace of that period now exists. The loftily
situated Turkish <i>Bordj Djedid</i> is now used as barracks. Opposite lies
the bare island of <i>Tabarca</i>, rising abruptly on the N. side, with a
picturesque old Genoese castle. Of the two, originally Carthaginian, quays
connecting the island with the mainland the westmost has lately been
restored, but the shallow harbour is scarcely used except by Sicilian
fishermen. The steamers of the Comp. Gén. Transatlantique (p. <a href='#Page_130'>130</a>)
anchor in the open roads.—For the future railway to <i>Mateur</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Tabarca to <i>Béja</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>64 M. <i>Ben-Bachir</i>, not far from the influx of the <i>Oued Mellègue</i>,
the ancient <i>Muluth</i>, and of the <i>Oued Tessa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>) into
the Medjerda. We cross the <i>Oued Bou Heurtma</i>, the <i>Armascla</i>
of the Romans. Fine view of <i>Jebel Gorra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_355'>355</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>71½ M. <i>Souk el-Khemis</i> (427 ft.; ‘fifth-day market’), a thriving
agricultural village, the largest at this end of the Dakla. The
valley now contracts. 79½ M. <i>Sidi-Zehili</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>87½ M. <i>Pont-de-Trajan</i> (Rail. Restaurant), misnamed after
a three-arched *<i>Bridge</i> of the time of Tiberius, 99 yds. long and
8 yds. wide, one of the oldest Roman structures in Barbary.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span><span class='sc'>From Pont-de-Trajan to Béja</span>, 9 M., branch-line in 24 min. (1 fr. 45,
1 fr. 10 c., 80 c.). The line ascends the bare valley of the <i>Oued Béja</i>, to
the N.—9 M. <b>Béja</b> (715–1000 ft.; Hôt. de France, etc.; pop. 12,000, incl.
1600 Europeans), the <i>Vaga</i> of the Roman period, when it had a great market
and was one of the most thriving places in the Medjerda valley, owes its
present prosperity to the grain-trade and the culture of early vegetables.
To the E., bordering the Avenue de la Gare, is the new quarter of the
Italian and French farmers, with the <i>Halle aux Grains</i>. To the W., on
the slope beyond the <i>Oued Bou Zegdem</i>, rises the picturesque old town.
On its N.E. margin the Grande Rue leads to the <i>Marché</i> (cattle-market,
Tues.) and to the <i>Souks</i> (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>). The <i>Grande Mosquée</i>, built in the form
of an Egyptian cross (p. <a href='#Page_376'>376</a>), one of the oldest in Tunisia, is famed for
its borrowed wealth of ancient Roman capitals. The only Roman ruins
are the <i>Bâb el-Aïn</i> (‘fountain-gate’) and relics of <i>Thermae</i> and of a <i>Basin</i>.
The <i>Town Walls</i>, with their many towers, were originally Byzantine, but
have been repeatedly restored. With the exception of the ‘keep’, the
Byzantine fortress on the top of the hill has been superseded by the
<i>Kasba</i>, built largely of Roman materials. On the <i>Bou Hamdan</i> (1047 ft.),
a hill 1 M. to the N.W. of Béja, lies a large <i>Punic Burial Ground</i>, with
rock-tombs.—Railways run from Béja to the N.E. to <i>Mateur</i> (p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>) and
to the S.W. to <i>Nebeur</i> (p. <a href='#Page_326'>326</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>The picturesque route to Tabarca (45 M.; motor-omnibus or diligence)
leads to the N. from Béja, past the zinc-mines of <i>Jebel Charra</i> (1414 ft.),
and through the now treeless valleys of the Oued Béja (<i>Oued Djorfane</i>
in its upper course) and the <i>Oued Sersar</i>. It next passes the richest
calamine or zinc-ore mines in Tunisia (<i>Jebel Damous</i>, <i>Aïn-Roumi</i>, <i>Jebel
Sidi Ahmed</i>) and leads through the grand ravine of <i>Khanguet Kef Tout</i>
into the valley of the <i>Oued Maden</i>. 25 M. <i>Djebel-Abiod</i> (Hôt. des Nefzas,
quite good), a village in the <i>Nefza Mts.</i>, famed for their cork-tree woods,
their abundant game, and their great deposits of hæmatite. (Railway
from Mateur to Djebel-Abiod, see p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>; thence to Tabarca under construction.)
We now drive to the W., between <i>Jebel Kherouf</i> (2035 ft.) on
the left and a chain of *Dunes (650 ft.) on the right, to <i>Râs er-Radjel</i>,
and cross the Oued el-Kébir to (45 M.) <i>Tabarca</i> (p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>From Pont-de-Trajan to <i>Teboursouk</i> (<i>Dougga</i>), see p. <a href='#Page_355'>355</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Medjerda, in its sinuous course, then forces its way through
the bare hill-country below Pont-de-Trajan. For a short distance
the train runs to the N.E. into the side-valley of the <i>Oued Zarga</i>,
stopping at (100½ M.) <i>Oued-Zarga</i> (322 ft.), and then returns to
the E., through hilly country, and below <i>Toukabeur</i> and <i>Chaouach</i>
(see below), into the valley of the Medjerda.</p>

<p class='c011'>113 M. <b>Medjez el-Bab</b> (197 ft.; Hôt. des Colons; omn. to
the diligence office 30 c.), a considerable village on the right bank
of the Medjerda, 1¼ M. to the S. of the station, was formerly <i>Membressa</i>,
a busy place on the Roman road from Carthage to Tebessa
(p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>). The eight-arched <i>Medjerda Bridge</i> was built in the
18th cent. with the materials of the Roman bridge; and the Roman
<i>Triumphal Arch</i>, to which the village owes its name (‘ford by the
gateway’), has lately been almost entirely demolished for a similar
purpose. Important corn-market on Mondays.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the slope of <i>Jebel Chaouach</i> (1778 ft.), some 5½ M. to the N.W.
of Medjez el-Bab, lies <i>Chaouach</i> (1480 ft.), with the ruins of the small
Roman town of <i>Sua</i> (triumphal arch, nymphæum, town-wall, etc.). About
1¼ M. to the W. of Chaouach are the ruins of <i>Toukabeur</i> (1221 ft.), the
Roman <i>Thuccabor</i>, with its ancient cisterns, gateways, temple, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>The train now proceeds, generally somewhat apart from the
tortuous stream, at the foot of bare hills (<i>Jebel Heïdous</i>, <i>Jebel
Lansarine</i>, etc.), to (119 M.) <i>El-Heri</i> and (122½ M.) <i>Bordj Toum</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>133 M. <b>Tebourba</b> (133 ft.; Hôt. Cafort, R. 2, B. ½, D. 2½,
pens. 6 fr.; pop. 2000) is pleasantly situated among olive-groves.
On a height (164 ft.) crowned with the kubba of <i>Sidi Ras-Allah</i>,
between the village and the Medjerda, are the scanty ruins of the
Roman town of <i>Thuburbo Minus</i>. About ½ hr. to the S. of Tebourba
lies the dam or *<i>Bridge of El-Bathan</i>, originally Roman, but
restored to form a reservoir for watering the olive-trees. Adjacent
are a small manufactory of chechias (a kind of fez) and barracks.
Near Tebourba are large quarries of gypsum.</p>

<p class='c011'>139 M. <i>Djedeïda</i>, junction for Bizerta (R. 54), with a barrage
and an agricultural school and farm of the Alliance Israélite.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train crosses the Medjerda and, at the arches of the *<i>Aqueduct
of Carthage</i> (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>), still 7½ M. long, the watershed between
the Medjerda valley and the undulating plain of Tunis.</p>

<p class='c011'>148 M. <i>La Manouba</i> (p. <a href='#Page_342'>342</a>). We then pass <i>Kassar-Saïd</i>
(on the left; p. <a href='#Page_342'>342</a>) and the (150½ M.) <i>Bardo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>), and for
a short time skirt the N. side of the <i>Sebkha es-Sedjoumi</i> (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>).
Lastly the train rounds the S. edge of the old town (<i>Rebat Bab-Djazira</i>,
p. <a href='#Page_337'>337</a>) and passes close to the <i>Manoubia Hill</i> (p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>)

<p class='c009'><i>Tunis</i>, Ital. <i>Túnisi</i>, capital of the <i>Régence de Tunis</i>, and seat
of the French Resident-General (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) and of the Mohammedan
university, is the largest city in N. Africa after Cairo and Alexandria,
and vies with Sfax as a most important harbour. Population about
200,000, of whom about 115,000 are Mohammedans, 22,500 Jews,
41,000 Italians, 14,000 French, 5400 Maltese, and 250 Greeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town lies in 36°47′ N. lat. and 10°10′ W. long., on the
E. margin of the narrow tongue of land (rising to 190 ft.) between
the <i>Lac de Tunis</i> (or <i>Lake Bahira</i>, p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>) and the small salt-lake
<i>Sebkha es-Sedjoumi</i>, an old lagoon. The central part of
the sea of houses composing the old town is the <i>Medina</i>, the oldest
Moorish quarter, built largely out of the ruins of Thunes,
Carthage, and Utica, and now the chief focus of trade and industry.
Adjacent, to the N. and S., are two poor quarters, also chiefly
Mohammedan, the <i>Rebat Bab-Souika</i> and <i>Rebat Bab-Djazira</i>,
formerly N. and E. suburbs. The monotonous European new town
in the low ground to the E. of the Medina, exposed in summer
to the exhalations of Lake Bahira, is gradually extending from
the <i>Porte de France</i> (formerly <i>Bab el-Bahar</i>, sea-gate) towards
the harbour. On the brow of the hill to the W. of the old town are
the old Kasba and most of the public buildings, almost all built under
the French protectorate. Some of these lie outside the Turkish
town-wall, once 6000 yds. long, erected in the 17th century.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Tunis</i>, the ancient <i>Thunes</i>, a Berber name given to an earlier Phœnician
colony, appears in history in 508 B.C. as an ally of Carthage. In
395 it was destroyed by rebellious Berber tribes. It was from Thunes
that Agathocles (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>) and Regulus (p. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>) advanced against Carthage,
and here, after the first Punic war, the discontented mercenaries from
Sicca Veneria (p. <a href='#Page_360'>360</a>) established themselves. Tunis was probably
destroyed by the Romans at the same time as Carthage (146 B.C.) and
rebuilt later. After the downfall of Carthage Utica (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>) entered into
the heritage of her proud neighbour, but for a short time only; for from
29 B.C. onwards Carthage resumed her ancient supremacy and continued
to flourish down to her second destruction in 698 A.D. This time Tunis
was her natural successor. But the nomadic Arabs, being ignorant of
navigation, and the Aglabides (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) preferred Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), which
had recently been founded in the heart of the Tunisian steppe; and the
succeeding Fatimite and Zirite dynasties favoured the Sahel, with Mehdia
(p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>) as their new capital, to the detriment of N. Tunisia. At length, under
the Hafsides (1206–1573; p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), Tunis became the capital, and rapidly
grew to be the greatest and fairest city in the land, as well as a zealous
promoter of the glorious Moorish art and science of the 13th and 14th
centuries. The most distinguished of the Hafside sovereigns was Abû
Abdallah Mohammed el-Mostanser Billah, who in 1270 defended his capital
successfully against Louis IX., the Saint (p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>). After the decline of
that dynasty at the close of the 15th cent. and the capture of Tunis by
Kheireddin (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) in 1534, the city was attacked by the Spaniards in
three different campaigns (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), and was conquered four times by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Turks and the Algerians (in 1569, 1573, 1689, and 1757); yet in the 17th
and 18th centuries, thanks to its Oriental trade and the booty of its pirates,
it again enjoyed great prosperity.</p>

<p class='c022'>The only mediæval buildings in the old town which have survived
all these vicissitudes are three mosques, now much modernized. The
distinctive character of the present town is of Mauro-Turkish origin.
Those who cross the threshold of the Orient here for the first time will
be specially struck with the narrow and crooked lanes of the Mohammedan
quarters, only 12–16 ft. wide, with the motley crowd in the Souks
(p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>), and with the picturesque concourse of all the tribes of N. Africa
and the Sahara. The poor Jewish quarter (p. <a href='#Page_337'>337</a>) is less interesting.
The strange costume of the women, with their kufias or sugar-loaf hats,
loose jackets, and tight-fitting trousers, is now rarely seen except on
members of the older generation, while the pretty, old-fashioned costume
of the girls is a thing of the past.</p>

United States consul at Tunis from 1842 until his death in 1852.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. The New Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>From the <i>Harbour</i> (Port; see inset map, Pl. E, 1), which together
with the Bahira Canal (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>) was constructed in 1888–96,
the short Avenue du Port (tramway No. 1, p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>) leads through the
<i>Piccola Sicilia</i>, a group of workmen’s huts, into the town, ending
at the bronze statue of <i>Jules Ferry</i> (1832–93), the French statesman
who brought about the occupation of Tunisia.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Avenue Jules-Ferry</span> (Pl. E, 4), or <span class='sc'>Avenue de la Marine</span>,
the finest street in the new town, 66 yds. wide and 710 yds. long,
is planted with double avenues of fig-trees. On the left, just beyond
the divergence, to the right and left, of the unfinished Avenue de
Paris (p. <a href='#Page_338'>338</a>) and Avenue de Carthage (Pl. E, 5–7), which together
are 2¼ M. long, rises the <i>Casino Municipal</i> (Pl. E, 4; p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Ave. Jules-Ferry ends at the <span class='sc'>Place de la Résidence</span> (Pl.
D, 4; band, see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>), the centre of the new town. To the left,
on the S. side, rises the <b>Palais de la Résidence</b> (Pl. D, E, 4),
or <i>Maison de France</i>, built in 1856–60 for the French consulate
(see p. <a href='#Page_334'>334</a>), and tastefully remodelled in 1890–2 by <i>Dupertuys</i>
as a dwelling for the resident-general. The beautiful garden is not
accessible. Opposite the Residence is the <b>Cathedral</b> (Pl. D, 4);
erected in 1893–7. The Rue es-Sadikia leads to the S. from the
W. end of the square to the <i>Gare du Sud</i> (p. <a href='#Page_329'>329</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Ave. Jules-Ferry is continued by the much narrower <span class='sc'>Avenue
de France</span> (Pl. D, 4), intersecting the older European quarter, the
favourite promenade of the town. A little to the S. of it, in the
Rue d’Italie, which leads to the <i>Post and Telegraph Office</i> (Pl.
D, 5), is the <i>Marché</i> (Pl. D, 5; interesting from 7 to 10 a.m.).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Rue de Russie, the southmost street in this quarter, is
the <i>Bibliothèque Française</i> (Pl. D, 5; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>), which is
well supplied with literature relating to N. Africa.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>
  <h4 class='c023'>b. The Old Town.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'>At the W. end of the Ave. de France (p. <a href='#Page_333'>333</a>), the starting-point
of several tramway-lines (see p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>), is the Porte de France
(p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>), and beyond it lies the <span class='sc'>Place de la Bourse</span> (Pl. D, 4),
which presents a busy scene all day. In and near this square are
most of the <b>Consulates</b> (British among others), as during the
Turkish period. The old <i>French Consulate</i> (about 1650 to 1860),
which served also as a warehouse (fondouk), is at No. 15 Rue de
l’Ancienne-Douane.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. from the Place de la Bourse run the two chief thoroughfares
of the Medina. To the right is the <span class='sc'>Rue de la Kasba</span> (Pl. D,
C, 4, 5; p. <a href='#Page_336'>336</a>), leading past the Jewish quarter (p. <a href='#Page_337'>337</a>) and the
<i>Souk el-Grana</i> (Pl. C, 4) to the upper boulevards (p. <a href='#Page_336'>336</a>), to
which it is the chief approach. To the left is the <span class='sc'>Rue de l’Eglise</span>
(Pl. D, C, 4, 5), leading direct to the Souks of the Medina, the main
business street of the Christian merchants in the Turkish period.</p>

<p class='c011'>We follow the Rue de l’Eglise. On the left is the small church
of <i>Ste. Croix</i> (Pl. C, D, 4, 5; 1662), to which the street owes its
name. Then, on the right, is the <i>Administration des Habous</i>, the
headquarters of the Mohammedan pious foundations. Lastly we
pass through a vaulted passage under the <i>Direction des Antiquités</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de l’Eglise ends at the Rue de Djamâa ez-Zitouna, on
the E. side of the chief mosque, the <b>Djamâa ez-Zitouna</b> (Pl. C,
5), which is said to trace its origin to the tomb of St. Oliva of
Palermo, a Christian saint revered even by many Mohammedans.
The mosque was founded in 732 by Obeïd Allah ibn el-Habbab,
enlarged by the Aglabide Sijadet Allah I. (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>), and repeatedly
altered under the Hafsides. When Tunis was plundered by the
troops of Emp. Charles V. the mosque was used as a stable. Since
then the edifice has been much modernized, and is lavishly adorned
with spoils from Carthage. The chief portal, behind the colonnade
in the Rue de Djamâa ez-Zitouna, where on Fridays the clergy
receive the Sheikh ul-Islam, or supreme pontiff, and the side-portal
in the Souk des Etoffes (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>) have each an ornamental
ancient pillar as a lintel. The many-aisled interior, with its 161
columns and two domes over the nave, is similar in plan to the
Sidi Okba Mosque at Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>). The new minaret, 145 ft.
high, erected in the Andalusian style by <i>Si Slîmân Ennigro</i> in
1894, is a free copy of the old tower. The pile of buildings is
best surveyed from the roof of the Dâr el-Bey (p. <a href='#Page_336'>336</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The mosque serves also as a lecture-room for the Mohammedan
<i>University</i>. The instruction is under the direction of the Sheikh
ul-Islam; there are about a hundred teachers and 400 students.
Admittance to the twenty-two medersas, or colleges, for students
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>from other parts of the country, and to the library famed for
7000 Oriental MSS. is granted to none but Mohammedans.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Zitouna Mosque lies in the region of the *<b>Souks</b> (Pl. C,
5; Arabic <i>sûk</i>, market), the market quarter of the Medina, dating
from the Hafside period (13th cent.). As usual in the East the
lanes are roofed over. The small narrow shops are shut in by a
counter, over which the trader swings himself into his seat with
the aid of a rope. Most trades have their own streets. It is
interesting to watch the people at work in those souks where the
wares are made on the spot. The larger bazaars in some of the
streets are designed solely to attract foreigners. The busiest time
is the early morning. Friday is the Mohammedan, and Saturday
the Jewish day of rest. As to purchases, see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>. In and near
the Souks are many small Arab coffee-houses and barbers’ shops.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Rue de Djamâa ez-Zitouna we turn to the right to visit the
<b>Souk el-Attârîn</b>, the spice-market, founded in 1249. Besides the spices
and perfumes sold here (such as essence of jasmine and rose-geranium,
sometimes palmed off on strangers as attar of roses), we observe amber,
dried henna-leaves, henna-powder (p. <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>), and the big candles, often
branched, which are used at weddings and for the tombs of saints.—The
side-street to the right, opposite the N. side of the mosque, is the
<i>Souk el-Blagdjia</i>, for leather-wares.</p>

<p class='c022'>At the W. end of the spice-market, to the left, opposite the Rue Sidi
Ben-Arous (see below), is the <b>Souk des Etoffes</b>, on the W. side of the
mosque, with its display of silk and woollen stuffs, carpets from Kairwan,
and rugs from the Djerid (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>) and from Djerba (p. <a href='#Page_393'>393</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Adjoining the Souk des Etoffes is the busy <i>Souk des Femmes</i>, the
only one frequented by Mohammedan women, where female apparel,
trinkets, and slippers of Saffian leather (p. <a href='#Page_109'>109</a>) are sold.</p>

<p class='c022'>Between these two souks the <i>Souk el-Leffa</i> (Pl. C, 5), off which, on
the right, is the <i>Souk el-Kebabdjia</i> (lace), leads to the *<b>Souk Sekajine</b>,
the saddle-market, where, among gorgeous caparisons embroidered in gold
and silver, we are specially struck with the ornaments worn by horses
at the fantasias (p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>We return to the Souk el-Leffa. Thence, to the left, we follow the
short <i>Souk ed-Dziria</i>, past the <i>Hôpital Sadiki</i> (Pl. B, C, 5), destined
for natives, to the—</p>

<p class='c022'>Rue Sidi Ben-Ziad, on the S. side of the Dâr el-Bey (p. <a href='#Page_336'>336</a>). The
small <i>Sidi Youssef Mosque</i> (‘Mosquée’; Pl. C, 5), belonging to the Hanefites
(p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>), with the handsome tomb of the founder and an octagonal
minaret, dates from 1610–37.—At the lower end of the street, where the
Souk el-Bey branches off to the left to the Place de la Kasba, we turn
to the right into the—</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Souk el-Berka</b>, the slave-market, which was abolished only in 1842.
Down to 1816 Christians captured by the pirates were sold here by auction.
This is now the seat of the silversmiths, goldsmiths, and dealers in antiquities,
mostly Jews. The best of their gold trinkets are from Paris; the
fine silver filigree is Genoese or Maltese; the ancient coins are often
spurious.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the Souk el-Berka the <i>Souk el-Trouk</i>, the street of the tailors,
almost all Jews, who make the rich costumes of the Moslems, leads back
to the Souk el-Attârîn.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the N.W. angle of the Zitouna Mosque the Rue Sidi Ben-Arous
leads into the Rue de la Kasba (p. <a href='#Page_334'>334</a>). At the junction of
these streets, adjoining the burial-chapel of <i>Mohammed Murad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Bey</i> (d. 1705), is the Hanefite <i>Mosque of Sidi ben-Arous</i> (Pl. C, 5),
of 1654, similar in plan to that of Sidi Youssef (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>), with an
elegant minaret.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de la Kasba ends at the <span class='sc'>Place de la Kasba</span> (Pl. B,
C, 5), with its charming grounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the S. side of this square rises the <b>Dâr el-Bey</b> (Pl. B, C,
5), the largest pile of buildings in the Medina, erected in 1810 on
the foundations of a Roman theatre(?) by Moroccan architects under
Hamuda Bey as his town-palace. It is now the seat of the French
secretary-general and other authorities. The Bey usually comes
hither on Monday mornings from La Marsa (p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>) for the transaction
of business. Admittance, see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>. The entrance is by the
portal where a sentry is posted.</p>

<p class='c016'>The covered quadrangle (patio) on the first floor forms the centre of
the palace. The fine timber ceiling in the dining-room is the only object
of interest in the state apartments. The council-chamber of the ministers
has a dome with remarkably fine stucco-work. Here, as in the Bardo and
at Kassar-Saïd, the effect is marred by European gewgaws.</p>

<p class='c022'>Fine *View from the flat roof over the white houses of the town,
the Zitouna and many smaller mosques. Best light at and after noon.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the W. of the Place de la Kasba, at the junction of the two
upper boulevards Bab-Benat (Pl. B, 4; p. <a href='#Page_337'>337</a>) and Bab-Menara
(Pl. B, C, 5, 6), the old town culminates in the <b>Kasba</b> (Pl. B, 5),
an extensive group of barracks on the site of the palace of the Hafsides
and the Turkish citadel. The <i>Kasba Mosque</i>, with its fine
minaret, well restored in 1904, dates from 1231–5.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the old Bab-Menara, where the Souk des Sacs diverges to
the reservoir of the waterworks (p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>), is the small <i>Mosquée el-Ksar</i>
(Pl. C, 5), the oldest in Tunis, said to have been founded by
Hassan ibn en-Nôman (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>). The handsome minaret (1545) is
an addition of the Turkish period.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. side of the mosque runs the Rue du Château. No. 3
is the <span class='sc'>Division d’Occupation</span> (Pl. C, 5), the seat of the French
commandant, formerly the *<i>Dâr-Hussein</i> (18th cent.; well restored
in 1876), one of the finest Mauro-Turkish palaces in Tunis. (Adm.
by special introduction only.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Rue des Andalous</i> (Pl. C, 5), which begins here, and its
side-street Rue du Riche are the aristocratic streets of the Medina.
Many of the houses have elegant marble portals and artistically
grated windows. Parallel, on the E., leading to the Avenue de
Bab-Djedid, runs the long Rue Tourbet el-Bey, in which at No. 62,
at the corner of the Rue Sidi-Zamouhl, rises the <i>Tourbet el-Bey</i>
(Pl. C, 6), the domed tomb of the Husseinites (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>; ladies sometimes
admitted).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue Sidi Kassem, the next side-street on the left, leads to
the <i>Djamâa Djedid</i> (‘new mosque’), or <i>Mosquée des Teinturiers</i>
(Pl. C, 5, 6), founded by Hussein Ali ben-Turki (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>). The modern
minaret is by Si Slîmân Ennigro (p. <a href='#Page_334'>334</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>The open space near the dilapidated <i>Bab Djedid</i> (Pl. C, 6),
dating from 1277, is an afternoon haunt of snake-charmers and
story-tellers (5–10 c. to the boy soliciting money).</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the Bab Djedid and the Place aux Chevaux (Pl. B, 6;
p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>) is the <b>Market Quarter</b> of <i>Rebat Bab-Djazira</i> (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>),
containing the <i>Souk el-Aâssar</i>, the <i>Souk des Armes</i>, and the <i>Marché-au-Blé</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Bab Djedid we return to the Place de la Kasba
(p. <a href='#Page_336'>336</a>; tramway No. 2, see p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the <span class='sc'>Boulevard Bab-Benat</span>, in an old Moslem cemetery on
the right, is the <i>Tekia</i> (Pl. B, 4, 5), a home for the aged (1905).
On the left, founded in 1876, is the <i>Collège Sadiki</i> (Pl. B, 4), a
high school for Moslems. Farther on rises the handsome <i>Palais
de Justice</i> (Pl. B, 4; 1901). These two buildings are in the neo-Moorish
style.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may now proceed direct to the Place Bab-Souika (see below;
tramway No. 3, p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>); but it is better to take the less direct route
through the N.W. part of the Medina, by the Rue du Lutteur (diverging
to the right from Boul. Bab-Benat, a little before the Palais
de Justice), Rue du Pacha (Pl. B, 4), Rue de la Hafsia (Pl. B, C, 4),
Rue Achour (Pl. C, B, 4, 3; with the Hanefite <i>Mosque of Sidi Mohammed
Bey</i> on the left), Rue el-Monastiri, and Rue Sidi-Mahrez.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the left, in the last-named street, rises the *<b>Mosque of
Sidi Mahrez</b> (Pl. B, 3), with several domes in the Turkish style,
built in the latter half of the 17th cent., resembling in the interior
the Ahmed Mosque of Constantinople (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>). The square minaret
was added early in the 19th century.—On the right is the school
or <i>Zaouïa Sidi Mahrez</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The picturesque <span class='sc'>Place Bab-Souika</span> (Pl. B, C, 3) lies between
the Medina and the poor <i>Rebat Bab-Souika</i> (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>). Executions
took place here in the Turkish period. The Rue el-Halfaouine
(‘alfa street’), partly vaulted over, and lined with butchers’ shops,
leads hence to the lively and industrious—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Place el-Halfaouine</span> (Pl. B, 2), with its numerous Arab cafés,
where on Mohammedan festivals, such as Ramadan (p. <a href='#Page_447'>447</a>) and
Bairam, the evenings and nights are spent in mirth and frolic. On
the W. side is the <i>Djamâa Sahab et-Taba</i> (Pl. B, 2), one of the
largest mosques in Tunis, founded on blocks of stone from Carthage.
The <i>Souk el-Djedid</i> on the N. side is for silk wares.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time permitting, we may glance at the <i>Rue des Potiers</i> (Pl. C, 3),
seat of the once noted pottery of Tunis, or at the <b>Jewish Quarter</b>
(<i>Hara</i>; Pl. C, 3, 4), in the N.E. part of the Medina. The chief <i>Synagogues</i>
(visitors admitted) are in the Impasse es-Snadli, at the corner
of Rue Sidi-Mardoun, in Rue Zarkoun (Pl. C, D, 4), etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>The interesting <i>Old Jewish Cemetery</i> (Pl. D, E, 3), just outside
the old town, is entered from the Rue du Cimetière-Israélite.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>
  <h4 class='c023'>c. Environs.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'><b>1.</b> About 1¼ M. to the N. of Tunis lies the *<b>Jardin du Belvédère</b>,
laid out in 1892, the most popular promenade in the environs,
well shaded with palm-trees, but still unfinished. The
grounds cover 250 acres on the slope of <i>Belvedere Hill</i> (269 ft.),
which was fortified in the Turkish period. The chief entrance is
at the Rond Point at the end of the Ave. de Paris (p. <a href='#Page_333'>333</a>; tramway
No. 7, p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>), and there is a side-entrance (tramway No. 6) in the
Ave. Carnot, near the <i>Pépinière Municipale</i> (nursery-ground) and
the <i>Cimetière Municipal</i> (opened in 1883).</p>

<p class='c011'>Halfway up, above the main entrance, rises the <i>Pavillon du
Belvédère</i> (café; fine view from the terrace). On the S. slope of
the hill, ¼ M. from the Avenue Carnot and concealed amid the
thick vegetation, is the <i>Mida</i>, the ruin of a mosque-court brought
from the souks of the Medina. Farther up is the *<i>Pavillon de la
Manouba</i>, a freely restored Moorish garden-pavilion from the Palais
de la Manouba (pp. <a href='#Page_342'>342</a>, 343), with fine ornamentation in stucco
and a charming view. The top of the hill affords a splendid *Panorama,
especially towards evening. To the S. is the old town with
the Kasba, the Manoubia Hill, and Fort Sidi Bel-Hassen; more to
the right, beyond the Sebkha es-Sedjoumi, rise the distant hills
of Zaghouan; to the E. lies Lake Bahira with the island of Chikly,
the Ship Canal, and the little towns of Goletta and Rades, backed
by the Gulf of Tunis and Cape Bon; then, more to the N.E., rise
the hills of Carthage, with the cathedral and Sidi Bou-Saïd; a little
to the left, in the plain, lie La Marsa and the Sebkha er-Riana; to
the W. are seen the Bardo and the two aqueducts.</p>

<p class='c016'>Adjoining the <i>Institut Pasteur</i> (1904), on the N. side of the Rond-Point,
is the entrance to the <b>Jardin d’Essais</b> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>), opened in 1892,
with many tropical and subtropical plants. Connected with it is the <i>Ecole
Coloniale d’Agriculture</i>, founded in 1898.</p>

<p class='c022'>The tramway (No. 7) runs on through olive-groves to (3 M.) the village
of <i>El-Ariana</i>, once famed for its Hafside palace of <i>Abu Fehr</i>, and now
noteworthy for its beautiful roses. It is a favourite resort of the Jews
of Tunis, especially on Saturday afternoons, when Jewish musicians and
dancers perform at the cafés.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>2.</b> A less extensive but more picturesque *View than that from
the Belvedere is obtained from the hill, to the W. of the old town,
on which lie the decayed Turkish forts of <b>Bordj Flifel</b> and <b>Bordj
Rabta</b> (193 ft.). The shortest way to the hill is by the Rue Bab
el-Allouch (Pl. B, 3; see tramway No. 3, p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>) and through the
gate of that name. We then follow the Bardo road (comp. p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>),
straight on, between the garden of the <i>Hôpital Civil</i> (Pl. A, 3, 4),
on the right, and the <i>Ecole Professionnelle Loubet</i> (Pl. A, 4), a
technical school, on the left. About 6 min. from the gate we diverge
to the right by a field-road, and we reach the top in 6 min. more.
Near the forts are numerous dilapidated <i>Silos</i> (rabta), once the
bey’s granaries.</p>
<div id='i_338'  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/i_338_large.jpg'><img src='images/i_338.jpg' alt='TUNIS et ses environs' class='ig001'></a>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>The Bardo is about 1 M. farther on, but we now return to the
crossroads (see above) and follow another road to the S., leaving the
village of <i>Mélassine</i> on the right, to the <i>Bab Sidi Abdallah</i>
(Pl. A, 5). Close to this gate is the <i>Château d’Eau</i> or <i>Reservoir</i>
(Pl. A, B, 5; visitors admitted) of the waterworks of Tunis, which was
substituted in 1859–62 for the Roman aqueduct of Carthage (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>).
It is supplied by the main conduit from Zaghouan (p. <a href='#Page_359'>359</a>), 58½ M.
long, by an auxiliary branch from the Aïn Djouggar (1276 ft.), 23 M.
distant, and (since 1905) by a new branch, 50 M. long, from Djebel
Bargou, which flows partly through a tunnel 4 M. in length.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>3.</b> The <b>Manoubia Hill</b> (240 ft.) may be reached in ¼ hr. by
a road to the S. from the <i>Bab Sidi Kassem</i> (Pl. A, 6), a town-gate
3 min. to the S. of the reservoir. Or we may start from the Place aux
Chevaux (Pl. B, 6; p. <a href='#Page_337'>337</a>), whence, near the <i>Collège Alaoui</i> (seminary
for teachers), we have a good view of the city and of Lake
Bahira, and then follow the Rue Bab el-Gorjani (Pl. B, C, 7). The
hill offers a fine view, especially in the morning, of the city, Lake
Bahira, the hills of Carthage and Cape Bon; at our feet lies the
Sebkha es-Sedjoumi; to the S. rise the hills of La Mohamédia and
Oudna, backed by the jagged mountains of Zaghouan.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>4.</b> From the <i>Bab Alleoua</i> (Pl. E, 7; station of tramway No. 8,
p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>) diverge the roads to Rades (p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>), Hammam-Lif (p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>),
and the Mornag (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>). We ascend across the <i>Cimetière Sidi Bel-Hassen</i>
(Pl. E, 7), the largest Mohammedan cemetery of Tunis, now
desecrated and therefore open to ‘unbelievers’, to the (12 min.)
<i>Zaouïa Sidi Bel-Hassen</i>, where we enjoy a charming view of the
city and Lake Bahira. The mosque, where many of the former beys’
wives are buried, stands on the site of a cavern which was for many
years inhabited by the Moroccan saint Sidi Bel-Hassen ech-Chadly,
the founder of the Chadlya brotherhood. The beautiful view from
the top of the hill (240 ft.), a little apart from the small <i>Fort Sidi
Bel-Hassen</i>, resembles that from the Manoubia Hill.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>5.</b> The <b>Bardo</b>, the former winter-residence of the beys, lies
in the fertile plain to the W. of Tunis, 1¼ M. from Bab Bou-Saâdoun
(Pl. A, 2), and 2 M. from Bab el-Allouch (Pl. A, B, 3, 4; see
p. <a href='#Page_338'>338</a>) or from Bab Sidi Abdallah (Pl. A, 5). Starting from the Porte
de France, we may go by tramway No. 3 (p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>; 5 c.) to Place Bab-Souika,
and thence by tramway No. 5 (15 c.) to the Bardo. About halfway
we cross the <i>Aqueduc du Bardo</i>, originally Roman, a branch
of the Carthage aqueduct (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>), restored by Andalusian Moors in
the 16th century.—Those who prefer to go by carriage should drive
out past the Reservoir (see above), and return round the N. side of
the old town, past the <i>Feskia</i> or <i>Ancien Réservoir</i> (Pl. A, 1, 2; for
rain-water) and the Mohammedan <i>Cimetière el-Bsili</i> (Pl. B, C, 1, 2),
to <i>Bab el-Khadra</i> (Pl. C, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>During the Turkish period the Bardo, like the Moroccan palaces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of the present day, formed a little town by itself. It included
several palaces of the beys and of the widows of deceased princes,
a treasury, dwellings of the court officials, a mosque, baths, barracks,
and a prison (zendala), and the whole group was enclosed
by a massive rectangular wall. Most of the sadly ruined buildings
have been utilized since 1900 as material for the new harbour-works.
At the S. end the outer wall has disappeared. From the
tramway station we enter the pretty grounds (1903) to the right.
Immediately to the left is the way to the remains of the chief palace
of the beys, and beyond it, on the left, to the Museum. Straight
ahead rises the ruin of a domed building; beyond it are the mosque
and the prison (now a reformatory for natives).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Palace of the Beys</b>, erected after 1782 by Hamuda Bey
(p. <a href='#Page_336'>336</a>), contains several objects of interest, apart from its tasteless
European furniture and poor pictures. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We enter by a flight of steps, adorned with marble lions of mediocre
Italian workmanship, and through a vestibule with delicate decoration
in stucco. The anterior colonnaded court is adjoined on the right by the
hall of justice, where the beys used to pronounce sentences of death which
were immediately carried out close by; opposite to it is the reception-room.
A passage to the left brings us to a second colonnaded court. A tasteful
marble portal (Italian) leads thence into the Salle des Glaces, which has
a fine ceiling and a valuable Kairwan carpet. We then mount the staircase
to the First Floor, where the large festal hall is on the right.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old <i>Palace of the Harem</i>, a creation of the extravagant
bey Sidi Mohammed (1855–9), rivalling the Alcázar of Seville
(p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>) in its wealth of decoration, was carefully restored in 1885–1888
and converted into a national museum.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<b>Musée du Bardo</b>, or <i>Musée Alaoui</i>, named after Bey
Ali Pasha (1882–1902), containing the rich yield of excavations in
every part of Tunisia, is now the finest collection in Barbary. The
Moorish and Turkish antiquities were arranged in 1900 in a pretty
little adjoining palace under the name of <i>Musée Arabe</i>. Adm., see
p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>; catalogue (1897) 10 fr., supplement (1906–10) 27 fr.; director,
M. Merlin.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Ground Floor.</b> The <span class='sc'>Entrance Room</span> contains Roman mosaics from
Henchir Sidi Djedidi, etc.; family tombstone of the imperial slave Optatus,
from the burial-ground of the Officiales (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>). Also, on the right, votive
stones from the temples of Saturn at Aïn-Tounga and on Jebel Bou-Kornin
(p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>), Roman milestones from the Tebessa road, etc.; on the
left, Roman tomb-cippi and inscriptions. Then two altars bearing regulations
in favour of farmers on the imperial estates: D441. from Henchir-Mettich
near Testour (time of Trajan), and D 442. from Aïn-Ouassel (time
of Septimius Severus); C 1030. Statue of Concordia from Djorf Bou-Grara
(p. <a href='#Page_392'>392</a>). At the end of the room, a much damaged Roman sarcophagus

tomb-stelæ, catapult-balls from an arsenal at Carthage, etc.—At the back-wall
of the side-room is a stela from Maktar, nearly 7 ft. high, with a
Libyan and neo-Punic inscription.—On the left of the Entrance Room is—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span><span class='sc'>Room III</span> (Early-Christian Room). In the centre, B 53. Font from El-Kantara

and fox hunt, in front); A 105. Representation of a country estate, with
hunting scenes. Between the columns of the portico are Roman statues
in marble from Carthage (C 944. Ganymede; C 979. Bacchus; C 924. Juno;
C 982. Isis; and others). Along the walls are marble busts and heads,
most of them from Carthage.—Adjoining this room on the N. is—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room VII</span>, formerly the banqueting-room, with superb *Dome carved

a Roman villa near Susa (‘Cortège de Neptune’). By the end-walls, A 25–27.
Three semicircular mosaics from Tabarca (beginning of the 4th cent. A.D.)
representing a country seat with park, stable, granary, sheds, and cellar.
By the left side-wall are two Roman mosaics (A 7. Fishing; A 12. Head
of Oceanus); A 19. Early-Christian relief with circus-scenes; old Christian
*Sarcophagus Mosaics from Tabarca, mostly representing the deceased in
the attitude of prayer, between two candles. The wall-presses contain

Bordj el-Djedid, theatre, and museum), Goletta, Maxula-Rades (p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>),
and back to Tunis is recommended. Luncheon (brought from Tunis) may
be taken beside the lighthouse at Sidi Bou-Saïd or at Carthage. Good
carriages are to be had also at Goletta and the stations of Carthage and
Marsa-Ville (2 fr. per hr.; but the fare should be fixed beforehand).—In
cool weather, especially in the forenoon, the <span class='sc'>Walk</span> from La Marsa viâ
Sidi Bou-Saïd to Carthage is very enjoyable.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Hotels</span> at Carthage: <i>Hôt. St. Louis de Carthage</i>, on the castle-hill,
tolerable, déj. or D. 3–3½ fr., wine dear; <i>Pavillon Beau-Séjour</i>, R. 3,
B. 1¼, déj. 2½, D. 3 fr.; <i>Hôt. des Citernes Romaines</i>, near the cisterns
of Bordj el-Djedid (p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>), plain but good.</p>

<p class='c022'>For a short visit to the ruins the following description will suffice.
For further study the traveller is referred to the Carte archéologique et
topographique des Ruines de Carthage (Paris, 1907; three sheets, scale
1 : 5000) and to ‘Carthage autrefois, Carthage aujourd’hui’ (2½ fr.; to be
had at the Musée Lavigerie), a full description, but partly out of date.
Comp. also the chapters on Carthage in <i>Cagnat’s</i> book mentioned at
p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>.—The guides and beggars are very importunate. Native vendors
offer spurious antiquities (cameos, coins, etc.), ‘just dug up’. It should
be noted that the ruins abound in awkward cavities and fissures, and
that, in summer especially, scorpions lurk under the loose stones.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Electric Tramway</span> (see above) to Carthage and Marsa-Plage
runs to the <i>Harbour</i> (p. <a href='#Page_333'>333</a>), crosses its N. entrance by an
embankment, and follows the N. bank of the ship-canal across Lake
Bahira (comp. p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>), skirting the passing-place of the steamers.
On the left is the islet of <i>Chikly</i> (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>6¼ M. <i>Arrêt du Bac</i>, station for the Goletta steam-ferry

little town of—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Goletta</b>, or <i>La Goulette</i> (Hôt. de la Gare, unpretending; pop.
5000, chiefly Sicilian and Maltese fisher-folk), the former little
harbour of Tunis, deserted since the opening of the ship-canal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>It was strongly fortified by Kheireddin (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) in 1534 and transformed
into a great naval station, but was soon captured by the
Spaniards and formed the base whence they kept Tunis in check
(1535–74).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the island between the ship-canal and the two narrow inlets
to the harbour are the <i>Dâr el-Bey</i>, an old palace of the beys, and
the disused <i>Marine Arsenal</i> founded by Ahmed Bey (1837–55).
On the shore, beyond the old harbour-mouth, which is only 6½ ft.
deep, rises the <i>Kasba</i>, now barracks.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Goletta to Maxula-Rades, see p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Between old Goletta and the ancient harbour of Carthage
stretches a tongue of land, the ancient <i>Taenia</i> or <i>Ligula</i>, between
Lake Bahira and the open sea, where bathing-places abound: 7¼ M.
<i>La Goulette Neuve</i>, with a long row of humble lodging-houses,
chiefly patronized by the poorer Jewish families from Tunis; 8 M.
<i>Khéreddine</i>, where the old palace of Khéreddine, once the all-powerful
minister of Bey Mohammed es-Saddok (1859–82), is now
a casino; 9 M. <i>Le Kram</i>, another favourite Jewish resort, on the
small <i>Baie du Kram</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next station is (9¾ M.) <i>Salambo</i>, a new colony of villas
named after Flaubert’s novel; near it is the ‘<i>Lazaret</i>‘, an old palace
of the beys’ harem, on the shore, between the two ancient harbours
of Carthage (p. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>), used as a cholera hospital in 1884 (now barracks).
10 M. <i>Douar ech-Chott</i>, on the E. side of this picturesque

<p class='c011'>10¼ M. <i>Dermèche</i>, station for <i>El-Kheraïb</i> (‘the ruins’), supposed

the S. side of the Kothon, and also for the <i>Palais de Dermèche</i>,
once the palace of the minister Mustapha ben-Ismaïl, and now the

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'><b>Carthage</b>, once the proud queen of the seas, lay 10 M. to the
E. of Tunis on a low range of hills culminating in <i>Cape Carthage</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>). The cape was originally an island, but was probably
united with the mainland by the deposits of the Medjerda before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the foundation of the city (comp. p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>). The neck of land between
Lake Bahira on the S. and the <i>Sebkha er-Riana</i> on the N.,
where the army of Regulus was annihilated in 255 and where
Scipio encamped in 146, was, according to Polybius, only 3000
paces (ca. 1½ M.) wide, but is now 3 M. at the narrowest part. In
the middle ages Douar ech-Chott (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>; ‘village on the salt-lake’)
lay on Lake Bahira. Carthage possessed two harbours. The outer
or commercial harbour lay between the Baie du Kram (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>) and
Bordj el-Djedid (p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>), where considerable remains of its quays
are preserved for a distance of nearly a mile. The inner or naval
harbour (Kothon) was an artificial inland basin, probably on the
same site as the two modern lagoons, with a rectangular entrance-basin
and a circular main harbour. On an islet in the latter lay
the naval arsenal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the two harbours ran the triple town-wall, which on one
side extended from the Bordj el-Djedid to the plateau between the
Odeon and Damous el-Karita (p. <a href='#Page_349'>349</a>), and on the other side enclosed
the castle-hill (see below) on the S. and W. sides. The market-place
(p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), on the N. side of the naval harbour, was connected
with the castle-hill by three narrow streets, the chief scene of
contest during the storming by Scipio. To the N.W. of the city-wall,
as early as the Punic period, lay the villa-suburb of <i>Megara</i>
or <i>Magalia</i> (now La Malga).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> Carthage was founded about 880 B. C. by Phœnicians from
Tyre, under the leadership, according to tradition, of Dido, adjacent to
<i>Kambe</i>, a colony from Sidon. Under the name of <i>Kart-hadasht</i> (‘new
town’) it extended gradually from the dale on the N.E. side of the Bordj
el-Djedid up to the castle-hill. Thanks to its most advantageous site
near the Sicilian straits and on the sea-route between Egypt and Spain,
and to its proximity to the valleys of the Medjerda and the Oued Miliane
(p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>), the richest in the land, it soon surpassed Utica (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>) and the
smaller Phœnician seaports in wealth and power. From the 6th cent.
onwards Carthaginian fleets contended with the Greeks and with the
Etruscans, from whom they wrested Corsica and Sardinia, for the mastery
of the W. Mediterranean, and in 480 their army of mercenaries, in
alliance with Xerxes, even attacked the Greeks of Sicily. After a great
struggle of more than two centuries for the possession of Sicily, during
which Agathocles (p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>) carried the war into his enemies’ country
(310–307), the intervention of Rome led to the three Punic wars (264–241,
218–201, and 149–146), to the occupation of Spain by the Carthaginians, and
to the capture and destruction of Carthage, after a heroic resistance, by
Scipio in 146 B. C. On its ruins, in 122, C. Gracchus attempted to found
a Roman colony, but it was not till the year 44 that the far-seeing policy
of Cæsar led to the firm establishment of the <i>Colonia Julia Carthago</i>.
The despatch by Augustus of a colony of veterans and the erection
of the city into the capital of the province in place of Utica (29 B. C.)
paved the way for the renewed glory of Carthage, which soon became the
greatest Mediterranean seaport next to Alexandria and the third-greatest
city in the Roman empire. Far and wide its schools of rhetoric and
philosophy were famous. Passionate champions of Christianity, like Tertullian
(160 to about 245), founder of the sect called after him, and Cyprian
(d. 258), who protested against the claim of Rome to precedence in
the church, were residents in Carthage, the chief bishopric in N. Africa.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>In numerous councils (from 393 onwards) the dogmas of the Catholic
church were here discussed and settled, and at the synod of the Gargilian
Thermæ in 411 St. Augustine with fiery eloquence combated the
doctrines of the Donatists (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) and the Tertullianists.</p>

<p class='c022'>Genseric (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) converted the old palace of the proconsuls into
his royal residence and made Carthage the capital of the Vandal empire,
and a little later the city became the residence of the Byzantine governors.
After Hassan ibn en-Nôman (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) had destroyed the city in 698,
almost as completely as Scipio had done, and after he had even caused
the harbours to be filled up, the ruins were used for centuries as a
quarry for the building of Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), Tunis, Goletta, and the small
towns around, while many of the Roman and Byzantine columns were
carried off by the Moors to Cordova and by the Italians to Palermo,
Amalfi, Pisa, and Genoa. The attempts of the Hafsides (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) to resuscitate
Carthage met with little success. To that dynasty belonged El-Mostanser-Billah,
against whom Louis IX., the Saint, directed his last
crusade. It was on the castle-hill of Carthage that Louis died of the
plague in 1270, and it was from Carthage that Emp. Charles V. led his
expedition against Tunis in 1535. Modern builders have again been busy,
at the cost of the ancient ruins, since the time of Card. Lavigerie (1825–92),
who made the Missions d’Afrique (see below) the centre of the catholic
missions in N. Africa and succeeded in 1884 in obtaining the restoration
of the old archbishopric.</p>

<p class='c022'>After all this endless havoc, and owing to constant alterations in the
earth’s surface, it is now very difficult to trace the plan either of the Punic
or of the Roman Carthage, which seems to have been laid out in chessboard
fashion. Yet the beauty of the scenery and the wealth of historical
memories amply compensates for the deplorable state of the ruins. The
valuable yield of recent excavations is now preserved in the Musée Lavigerie
(see below), in the Bardo Museum (p. <a href='#Page_340'>340</a>), and in the Louvre.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Byrsa</b> (194 ft.), the ancient castle-hill of Carthage, 660
yds. from the sea, was the site in the Punic period of a temple of
Eshmun, and in the Roman period of a temple of Æsculapius and
of the palace of the proconsul. It is now called the <i>Colline de
St. Louis de Carthage</i> and is occupied by the chapel of St. Louis,
the seminary, and the archiepiscopal cathedral. The terrace on the
side next the sea, adjoining the Hôtel St. Louis de Carthage (p. <a href='#Page_343'>343</a>),
commands a delightful *View of the gulf of Tunis and the site of
ancient Carthage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Grand Séminaire de Carthage</i>, founded in 1875 by Card.
Lavigerie as a mission-house and seminary for the Pères Missionnaires
d’Afrique (commonly called Pères Blancs from their white
semi-Arab garb), contains the *<b>Musée Lavigerie</b>, dating from
1875, where the yield of the excavations made by Père Delattre,
the learned principal of the seminary, is preserved. Adm. on
Mon., Thurs., Frid., and Sat., 2 to 5.30; on Sun. and holidays 2–3
and 4 to 5.30; probably also before 11, and on other afternoons,
on application (closed in Holy Week after Wed.). Visitors make a
donation to the offertory-box. No catalogue.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the <span class='sc'>Seminary Garden</span>, below the small <i>Chapelle de St. Louis</i>,
built in 1845 to the memory of King Louis the Saint (see above), are
preserved eight barrel-vaults, with semicircular niches, relics of some
ancient edifice of unknown character. On the terrace in front of the chapel
is a large Roman sarcophagus in marble. Around it are placed numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Punic cinerary urns. In the grounds lie fragments of ancient buildings.
Along the garden-walls are ranged Roman mosaics, inscriptions, and fragments
of sculpture.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Colonnade</span> of the seminary is adorned with three colossal figures
of Victory in high-relief, of the time of the proconsul Q. Aurelius Symmachus
(373–5), one of the last champions of expiring paganism.—The
<span class='sc'>Vestibule</span> contains two sadly mutilated early-Christian reliefs, the Annunciation
to the Shepherds and the Adoration of the Magi, from Damous
el-Karita (p. <a href='#Page_349'>349</a>).—To the left, in the <span class='sc'>Salle de la Croisade</span>, are Punic,
Roman, and early-Christian inscriptions.—On the right is the—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Punic Room</span>, containing the most valuable collection, almost exclusively
from Punic rock-tombs (8th–2nd cent. B.C.), unrivalled except
in the museum of Iviza. In the 1st Case in the middle of the room are
Egyptian scarabs and amulets, trinkets (some Egyptian), and weights.
2nd Case: lamps and vases in clay, gold trinkets, beautiful Greek ivory
carving (swan bearing a goddess), an Etruscan inscription (the only one
yet found in Africa), Egyptian signet-rings, etc. 3rd Case: necklaces
composed of amulets, glass amulets with faces of iridescent glass, gold
signet-rings with engraved figures, fragments of painted ostrich-eggs,
toilet articles in lead, Cupid in terracotta resembling the Tanagra figurines,
a Greek work. 4th Case: bronze mirrors and ‘little axes’ or razors, probably
amulets.—In the wall-presses, on the left of the entrance, Punic
vases and terracotta masks, iron and bronze weapons. By the left side-wall
are statuettes in clay in the Egyptian and Cyprian style, Corinthian
and Attic vases, an Etruscan vase (toilet scene), two bronze jugs with
fine figures as handles. By the back-wall are terracottas.—At the end
of the right side-wall, in the window-niche, cinerary urn of the priest
Baalchelek, also that of another priest with a beautiful relief of the
deceased. By the last window but one, on the right side, are five cinerary
urns; in front of them stands a sarcophagus with two skeletons. Then,
at the end of the room, are four anthropoid *Sarcophagi in the Greek style
(end of 4th cent. B.C.); two bearded priests in the attitude of prayer (one
of them a cast); a priestess, with remarkably well-preserved painting,
holding a dove and a situla.</p>

<p class='c022'>Lastly we enter the <span class='sc'>Roman-Christian Room</span> from the garden. By
the end-wall on the left are early-Christian mosaics and lamps. By the
back-wall, Roman mosaics (incl. Autumn and Winter); marble sculptures
(Ceres, bust of Apollo, etc.). By the right end-wall are Roman terracottas,
*Lamps with figure-compositions, and three reliefs in stucco from
the tomb of a lady of rank. By the entrance-wall, Roman and Byzantine
weights.—The 1st Case in the middle of the room contains early-Christian
relics from the abbey-hill (p. <a href='#Page_349'>349</a>), mostly of the Vandal period. 2nd Case:
a bronze lamp and the clay statuette of an organ-player (upper part broken
off). 3rd Case: Roman bronzes and glasses; rolls of lead inscribed with
curses, from the burial-ground of the Officiales (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>); Byzantine and
mediæval coins. 4th Case: coins of the Phœnician down to the Byzantine
periods.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Cathedral</b> (<i>Primatiale de St. Cyprien et de St. Louis</i>), a
basilica with nave and two aisles, built in 1884–90 by <i>Abbé Pougnet</i>,
in the Byzantine-Moorish style, contains (in the choir) the archiepiscopal
throne and the tomb of Card. Lavigerie (p. <a href='#Page_346'>346</a>). Over
the high-altar is the valuable reliquary of St. Louis, executed by
Armand Caillat, a goldsmith of Lyons. Adm. from 5 to 11.15 and
12.30 to 5.30 (in summer 6.45).</p>

<p class='c011'>The limestone blocks on the S.W. side of the cathedral, near the
small eucalyptus grove, are remains of the stylobate of a <i>Roman
Temple</i>. From the brow of the hill we obtain a good survey of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>the site of the ancient naval harbour (p. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>) and of the Roman
circus (see below). The view of Lake Bahira is charming at sunset.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the brow of the hill and the road descending to Douar
ech-Chott (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>) Père Delattre’s excavations have brought to light
a number of buildings a thousand years apart in date. Above, on
the margin of the hill, is an interesting <i>Punic Necropolis</i> with
rock-tombs; lower down are remains of the <i>Town Walls</i>, hastily
restored under Theodosius II. (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>) in 424, and traces of the
<i>Roman Road</i> leading to the harbour; then Punic tombs again, and
below them the foundations of a <i>Byzantine Dwelling House</i> (a room
here contains early-Moorish tombs).</p>

<p class='c016'>Below the S. angle of the castle-hill we come upon ancient fortifications.
Farther down is a wall or buttress composed of thousands of early-Roman
earthenware amphoræ; also a rock-hewn <i>Chapel</i> (key at the Seminary)
with remains of wall-paintings (saint bestowing a blessing) in the style
of the catacomb frescoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Time permitting, we follow the Sidi-Daoud road to the N.W.
from the castle-hill, cross the Goletta and La Marsa highroad, and
reach (¼ hr.) the Roman <b>Amphitheatre</b>, which has been broken
up only since the 16th cent., and which Edrisi, the geographer
(1154), has described as one of almost matchless splendour. All
that is left of it consists of a few remains of substructures deeply
imbedded in rubbish, several underground passages, and in the
centre of the arena (where a chapel with a cross recalls the martyrs
Perpetua and Felicitas, p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>) three underground chambers, probably
for the machinery used in theatrical performances.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the S., not far from Douar ech-Chott (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), are a few vestiges
of the Roman <i>Circus</i>. It measured 770 by 110 yds.; the Spina, or partition
round which the racing chariots passed, was 380 yds. long.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely a hundred paces to the N.W. of the amphitheatre, near a
farm-building, is a <i>Burial Ground of the Officiales</i> (1st–2nd cent.),
the imperial freedmen and slaves employed in the proconsul’s office
(tabularium).—Beyond the amphitheatre the road passes a second
<i>Burial Ground</i> of the same kind on the right and the foundations
of the <i>Villa of Scorpianus</i> (identified by the inscription ‘Scorpianus
in adamatu’) on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. of the highroad, 12 min. from the castle-hill, lies
the dirty village of <b>La Malga</b> (82 ft.), which swarms with begging
children. On the N.E. side of the village are scanty ruins of Roman
<i>Thermae</i>. The <span class='sc'>Cisterns</span> in the middle of the village, 15 (originally
24) barrel-vaults now in a very ruinous condition and partly
used by the natives as dwellings or stables, once formed the chief
reservoir fed by the <i>Roman Aqueduct</i> (pp. <a href='#Page_329'>329</a>, 353, 358), begun
under Hadrian in 117, but not completed till 163. The whole city
was supplied thence by means of leaden pipes.</p>

<p class='c016'>A <i>Roman Road</i> leads almost in a straight line from La Malga, to the
N.E., close past Damous el-Karita (p. <a href='#Page_349'>349</a>) and past the Basilica Maiorum
(p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>), to the Arrêt de la Briqueterie (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>From La Malga we follow the road to the S.E., past the <i>Croix de
St. Cyprien</i>, a memorial of the famous bishop (pp. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>, 346), along
the course of the old ‘Conduit Souterrain’, to the <b>Abbey Hill</b>
(171 ft.), often groundlessly called <i>Colline de Junon</i>, rising to the
N.E. of the castle-hill. Here are situated the <i>Monastère du Carmel</i>,
a Carmelite nunnery, and the <i>Petit Séminaire</i>, the original mission-house
of the White Fathers, now an orphanage presided over by
the Sœurs Missionnaires d’Afrique, a sisterhood also instituted
by Card. Lavigerie. On the roadside, between these buildings,
remains of <i>Roman Houses</i> and <i>Cisterns</i> have been excavated.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the slope of the <b>Odeon Plateau</b> (181 ft.), the N.E. continuation
of the abbey-hill, near the bridge of the electric tramway,
and 3 min. to the left of the upper Carthage and Sidi Bou-Saïd road
(p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>), are relics of the <i>Roman Theatre</i>, including several rows
of the seats of the cavea (p. <a href='#Page_293'>293</a>) and parts of the stage-building.
After the partial restoration of the theatre a grand performance
took place here in 1908 and similar representations will be occasionally
repeated.—A few paces to the S.W. of the stage we
come to the foundations of a small Roman <i>Temple Circulaire</i>. To
the N.E. of the theatre, on the S.E. slope of the plateau, are the
more considerable remains of <i>Roman Houses</i>, but these have recently
been threatened with demolition.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the plateau itself, about a hundred paces above the theatre,
in the midst of a <i>Punic Necropolis</i> (3rd cent. B.C.), are relics of
pavement and several underground passages marking the site of
the <i>Odeon</i>, a roofed theatre (theatrum tectum) for concerts, built
under the proconsul Vigellius Saturninus (about 212 A.D.). Both
the theatre and the odeon are said to have been destroyed by the
Vandals in 439.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the old town-wall (p. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>), about 135 yds. to the N. of
the Odeon, and 3 min. to the W. of station Ste. Monique (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>),
lies an extensive early-Christian cemetery, in the centre of which
lie the ruins of <b>Damous el-Karita</b> (domus caritatis?), a great
basilica. This church, 71 by 49 yds., was built at different periods.
The oldest basilica with its ten aisles (4th cent.) was orientated to
the S.E., and the second, with eight aisles, probably of the Vandal
period, was turned towards the S.W. A third building, again with
ten aisles, evidenced by its reduced size the decline of Carthage in
the Byzantine period, as it consisted only of the old transept converted
into a nave and of the four N.W. aisles of the second basilica.
Within the oldest nave, in the axis of the first choir-recess, a new
apse was erected. The <b>⟙</b>-shaped building thus resulting, with its
very short and many-aisled body, seems to have been the model on
which Hassan ibn en-Nôman built the Kairwan mosque, as well as
the source of much of its material (comp. pp. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>, 376).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Adjoining the basilica on the N.E. is a vast semicircular <i>Atrium</i>
(see p. <a href='#Page_316'>316</a>), belonging to one of the two earlier churches, with
remains of the fountain of purification and of a trefoil-shaped
memorial-chapel (comp. p. <a href='#Page_317'>317</a>) built into the colonnade. On the
S.W. side of the basilica lie the foundations of a <i>Baptistery</i> with
an octagonal font.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the outskirts of a small olive-grove, reached either across the
fields from Damous el-Karita (in 8 min.) or to the W. from the Arrêt
de la Briqueterie (2 min.; p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), is the <b>Basilica Maiorum</b>, excavated
in 1907. In the Vandal period this was the church of the Arian bishop.
In the Confessio (10½ by 10¼ ft.), according to an inscription, the martyrs
Perpetua and Felicitas (d. 203; see also below and p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>) were
buried. In the contiguous early-Christian cemetery bishops’ tombs and a
cistern have been discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>We conclude our visit with a glance at the ruins in the <span class='sc'>Plain</span>
by the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the slope of the Odeon plateau, between the two roads to
Sidi Bou-Saïd, extends a large <b>Punic Necropolis</b> (<i>Nécropole de
Douïmès</i>), containing many rock-tombs of the 7–5th centuries.
Near it are remains of <i>Punic Pottery Kilns</i> and the foundations
of the <i>Basilica of Dermèche</i>, a Byzantine church with double
aisles and traces of a baptistery with its octagonal font. A few
paces to the N. we come to a <i>Roman Cistern</i>, 85 ft. deep, and
vestiges of an <i>Early Christian Monastery</i> (St. Stephen’s?).</p>

<p class='c011'>Close by are the *<b>Cisterns of Bordj el-Djedid</b>, on a side-branch
of the lower road, the largest in the ancient city after those
of La Malga, whence they were supplied. They were restored in
1887 and utilized for the new waterworks of Tunis (p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>). The
building, once dreaded by the natives as the ‘devil’s cavern’ (Douames
ech-Chiatinn), forms a rectangle of 147 by 44 yds., with
seventeen parallel barrel-vaults of 33 by 8 yds., two filtering basins,
and broad side-passages (keeper ½ fr.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Close to the sea, a little to the S.E., perhaps on the site of the
harbour of Kambe (p. <a href='#Page_345'>345</a>), lie the shapeless ruins of the <b>Thermes
d’Antonin</b>, or <i>Baths of Dermèche</i>, re-erected under Antoninus
Pius about 145, once perhaps the largest at Carthage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the baths and the ruinous Turkish fort <i>Bordj el-Djedid</i>
(49 ft.) lie the foundations of the superb <i>Roman Stairs</i> (Escalier
Monumental) which once ascended from the quay to the Platea
Nova, one of the largest squares in Roman Carthage. Their marble
blocks were used in the building of the cathedral in 1884.</p>

<p class='c016'>An underground Roman building, with a flight of twenty-five steps,
to the N.E. of the Bordj el-Djedid, formerly called Fanum Cereris, but
now termed <i>Carcer Castrensis</i>, is said to have been the prison of the
martyrs Perpetua and Felicitas (see above).—Near it is a <i>Roman Tower</i>
resembling a bastion, half in the sea.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the new road from Bordj el-Djedid to station Ste. Monique (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>)
is the ‘<i>Kubba Bent el-Re</i>‘, a number of underground chambers of unknown
object, formerly called ‘Baths of Dido’.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>A picturesque rock-path skirting the abrupt coast, besides the
two roads named on p. <a href='#Page_350'>350</a>, leads from Carthage to <b>Sidi Bou-Saïd</b>,
about 2¼ M. from the Byrsa. This wealthy and highly picturesque
village, almost entirely Mohammedan, with the bey’s summer residence,
a fine beach for bathing, and the shrine of the local saint
(much frequented on Fridays), lies at the E. end of <i>Cape Carthage</i>
or <i>Cartagena</i> (423 ft.; Arabic <i>Râs Sluguia</i>), which has kept its
Punic name throughout the ages. From the entrance to the village
(station and cab-stand) we ascend straight to a small square with
several Arab cafés, then by a path in steps to the left, again to the
left, and lastly to the right, to the round lighthouse (<i>Phare</i>;
½–1 fr.). From the top we enjoy an exquisite *View, which is
finest by morning light, of the site of Carthage, the whole of the
bay stretching to Cape Farina (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>), and Lake Bahira with its
mountain background.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the lighthouse a beautiful path leads past the <i>Poste
Optique</i> and behind the vineyards of the <i>Archiepiscopal Palace</i>,
to the Arrêt de la Corniche (p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>) and (½ hr.) <b>La Marsa</b> (Hôt.
de la Régence), a village in the fertile plain between Cape Carthage
and Jebel Khaoui (see below), with many country-houses and a
bathing beach (dangerous currents). About halfway between the two
stations (p. <a href='#Page_343'>343</a>) is the <i>Palais du Bey</i>, where the present prince
(p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) usually resides. (Adm. to the stables only, containing the
state-carriages; fee 1 fr.)</p>

<p class='c016'>To the N.W. of La Marsa extends <b>Jebel Khaoui</b> or <i>Kraoui</i> (345 ft.;
ascent from La Marsa and back viâ Kamart ca. 2½ hrs.). On the top and
the N. slope are many rock-tombs, remains of the <i>Jewish Necropolis</i> of
Roman Carthage. Fine view, to the S. to Tunis, and to the N.W. over
the <i>Sebkha er-Riana</i> to the Medjerda delta as far as Utica (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>). On
the N. side of the hill, on the reddish <i>Cape Kamart</i>, lies the picturesque,
palm-girt village of <i>Kamart</i>, with the ruined <i>Bordj Ben-Aïed</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>40½ M. <b>Mateur</b> (Rail. Restaurant; Hôt. de France, etc.;
pop. 5000, incl. 1600 Italians), a small town nearly 1 M. from the

Tine</i> into the <i>Oued Jemine</i> or <i>Joumine</i>, and is still enclosed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>its old walls, built partly out of the ruins of the Roman <i>Oppidum
Matarense</i>. It is the corn and cattle market for the fertile <i>Plaines
de Mateur</i>, which were densely peopled in ancient times, and for
the Berber tribes of the <i>Bejaoua</i> and <i>Mogod Mts.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>A railway runs from Mateur viâ (17 M.) <i>Jefna</i>, in the Nefza Mts., to
<i>Djebel-Abiod</i> (p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>), whence it is being extended to <i>Tabarca</i> (p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>).—Another
line connects Mateur with <i>Béja</i> (p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The train crosses the plain, to the N., towards the <i>Garaet
Ichkeul</i> or <i>Achkel</i>, the <i>Sisara Lacus</i> of the ancients, a freshwater-lake
abounding in fish, but very shallow and rapidly filling up.
On the S. side is a marshy tract where within the last few decades
a large herd of half-wild Italian buffaloes has sprung up. Above
it towers <i>Jebel Ichkeul</i> (1667 ft.), noted for its marble, the chief
landmark of the bay of Bizerta.</p>

<p class='c011'>50 M. <i>Oued-Tindja</i> (Hôt. de la Gare) lies on the strip of land,
barely 2 M. broad, between Lake Ichkeul and the <b>Lac de Bizerte</b>
(Arabic <i>Garaet Tindja</i>). The latter, the ancient <i>Lacus Hipponensis</i>,
ca. 30,000 acres in area and 40 ft. deep at places, is now the chief
French naval harbour on the Mediterranean next to Toulon.</p>

<p class='c016'>A strategic railway and a road (omn. 20 c.) lead to the E. from Oued-Tindja
to (2 M.) <b>Ferryville</b> (Hôt. de l’Amirauté; Hôt. de l’Arsenal; pop.
3000, largely Italian dock-labourers), the youngest town in Tunisia, named
after Jules Ferry (p. <a href='#Page_333'>333</a>), and to (2¾ M.) the small bay of <i>Sidi-Abdallah</i>,
on which, 9½ M. from the open sea, a <i>Naval Arsenal</i>, with five large
dry-docks, was built in 1899–1908.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train crosses the <i>Oued Tindja</i>, the sinuous effluent of
Lake Ichkeul, and rounds the marshy W. bank of Lake Bizerta.
55½ M. <i>Sidi-Ahmed</i>, opposite <i>Djezira el-Kebira</i>, the largest

<p class='c011'>59 M. <i>La Pêcherie</i>, on the <i>Goulet</i>, a narrow arm of the sea to
the N., which, with the new harbour-canal (p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>), connects the
dockyard with the open sea. On the small <i>Baie Ponty</i>, now used
as a torpedo-boat station, rise the <i>Arsenal de la Défense-Mobile</i>
and the handsome <i>Amirauté</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>A road leads to the S. from the station through olive-woods to (½ M.)
the <b>Barrage des Pêcheries</b>, two fish-dams about 1000 yds. long, adjoining
the S.W. end of the Goulet (here 55 yds. across), where the fish
descending from the lakes to spawn in the sea are caught in great numbers.
The yield, a few years ago ca. 580 tons, but now much reduced, is sent
to Tunis and Marseilles.</p>

<p class='c009'>We pass the <i>Baie de Sebra</i>, the inner harbour of Bizerta, as
yet little used, and the <i>Artillery Arsenal</i>, intersect the new S.

was one of the earliest Phœnician settlements on the Tunisian
coast. It lies on the W. shore of the <i>Bay of Bizerta</i>, between a
range of hills on the N.W., culminating in <i>Jebel Kebir</i> (900 ft.),
and a strip of land (once bounding the Bizerta Lake, and also fortified),
to the S.E., beyond the harbour-canal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old town, to which many Moors flocked after the fall of
Granada (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>), and which was occupied for a short time by
Charles V. on his way back from Tunis in 1535 (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) and was
to a great extent destroyed by a Venetian fleet in 1785, rises on
the hill-side between the ruined <i>Kasba</i> and the <i>Fort d’Espagne</i>,
both originally built by the Spaniards. The <i>Old Harbour</i>, unimportant
in ancient times, became in the 16th cent. a favourite haunt
of pirates, but is now used by fishing-boats only. Of the <i>Old
Harbour Canal</i>, completely choked up with the mud of centuries,
the mouth alone now exists. The new town, with its busy market
(Tues. and Thurs.), is still in embryo.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Avant-Port</i>, 215 acres in area, constructed by the Compagnie
du Port de Bizerte in 1890–5, is sheltered by two piers, the
Jetée du Nord (1337 yds. long) and the Jetée du Sud (1041 yds.),
and by a new mole or breakwater (670 yds.). The commercial
harbour consists of the <i>New Harbour Canal</i>, 1 M. long, 263 yds.
broad, and 33 ft. deep, the entrance to the Goulet (p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>), and also
of the Baie de Sebra (p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>). Two steam-ferries (bacs à vapeur;
passage free) cross to the N.E. bank of the canal, where there are
large coal-stores near the village of <i>Zarzouna</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>High Road from Tunis to</span> (37½ M.) <span class='sc'>Bizerta</span> diverges to the N.,
between the Bardo (p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>) and Kassar-Saïd (p. <a href='#Page_342'>342</a>), from the road connecting
Tebourba with Medjez el-Bab (p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>), intersects the Roman *Aqueduct
of Carthage (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>), which was here restored in the 16th cent., and ascends
through olive-woods to the saddle (269 ft.) between the hills of Ariana
(p. <a href='#Page_338'>338</a>), on the right, and <i>Jebel Ahmar</i> (1060 ft.), on the left.</p>

<p class='c022'>10 M. <i>La Sebala</i> lies on the S. edge of the marshy Medjerda delta
(p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>), now called <i>Sebala</i>. 16 M. <i>Fondouk el-Kantara</i>, a caravanserai
on the right bank of the Medjerda, near the old seven-arched bridge.</p>

<p class='c022'>Just beyond (19½ M.) <i>Oued Cherchara</i> a road branches off, to the N.E.,
past the spurs of <i>Jebel Menzel Roul</i> (541 ft.), once a cape, to (2 M.) the
ruins of <b>Utica</b>, the earliest Phœnician settlement in this region. Before
the rise of Carthage it was the richest trading town in Barbary, and from
146 to 29 B.C. it was the capital of the province of Africa and seat of
the Roman proconsul. It was here that the younger Cato committed suicide
(46 B.C.) on the overthrow of Pompey’s party in the civil war against
Cæsar. The harbour, entirely silted up since the middle of the 3rd cent.,
lay between the cape and a small island off the coast. The sea is now
5½ M., and the mouth of the Medjerda, near the Porto-Farina lagoon
(p. <a href='#Page_354'>354</a>), is nearly 10 M. distant. The Roman town was destroyed by
Hassan ibn en-Nôman (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) in 698, at the same time as Carthage. The
ruins, now called <i>Henchir Bou-Chateur</i>, consist chiefly of the aqueduct
and cisterns, a theatre, a vast amphitheatre, and large thermæ.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Beyond Jebel Menzel Roul the Bizerta road traverses a desolate plain,
strewn with Roman ruins. On the S.E. side of <i>Jebel Kechbata</i> (1370 ft.),
and also in the marshy plain beyond it, roads diverge to the right (one
12½, the other 15 M.) to <b>Porto-Farina</b> (pop. 1400, incl. 320 Europeans,
mostly Maltese), the <i>Ruscinona</i> of antiquity, a notorious pirates’ harbour
in the Turkish period. In 1665 it was destroyed by an English fleet,
but it was restored and fortified by Ahmed Bey (1837–55). Potatoes are
largely cultivated in the neighbourhood. The <i>Lac de Porto-Farina</i>, on
the S. side of <i>Jebel Nadour</i> (883 ft.), once abounding in fish, has been
filled up by the deposits of the Medjerda since the middle of last century.</p>

<p class='c022'>Beyond the dunes of <i>Aïn Bou-Ras</i>, where the new water-conduit of
Bizerta, 8½ M. long, has its source, our road runs close to the lake of
Bizerta, passes (34½ M.) <i>Menzel Djemil</i>, and ends on the old neck of land
on the harbour-canal of (37½ M.) <i>Bizerta</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_353'>353</a>).</p>

<h3 class='c020'>55. From Tunis to Dougga (<i>Le Kef</i>).</h3>

<p class='c016'>Excursionists to Dougga usually start from the station of <i>Medjez el-Bab</i>

Dougga direct. Or we may take a carriage (30 fr.; ordered in advance
at the Hôt. des Colons) or the diligence (6 hrs.; 2½ fr.) from Medjez el-Bab
to (28 M.) <i>Teboursouk</i>, whence we go on to (3¾ M.) Dougga by carr.
(5–6 fr.) or on mule-back (3–4 fr.).—The journey may be made also from
the station of <i>Pont-de-Trajan</i> (p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>; 66½ M. by railway in 2¾–4 hrs.;
fares 12 fr., 9 fr. 10, 6 fr. 40 c.); ride thence (mule being ordered beforehand

10 fr. 30, 7 fr. 25 c.); ride thence across <i>Jebel Sidi Abdallah Ben-Cheid</i>
to (19 M.) Teboursouk.</p>

<p class='c022'>The excursion from Tunis to Dougga and back, in one day, is far
more easily made by motor-car (p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>). Motoring parties are occasionally
formed at the tourist offices (p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>From Tunis to (41 M.) <i>Medjez el-Bab</i> by railway, see pp. <a href='#Page_329'>329</a>,
328.—The two roads from Tunis to Medjez el-Bab, one direct
(35½ M.) viâ <i>Bordj el-Amri</i>, the other, passing the station and

bank of the Medjerda, near the bridge (p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Our road leads from Medjez el-Bab in the same direction as
the Roman road from Carthage to Tebessa (see p. <a href='#Page_328'>328</a>), to the S.W.,
generally a little apart from the Medjerda, past a good many Roman
ruins. 9 M. <i>Slouguia</i> (299 ft.; the ancient <i>Chidibbia</i>), a village
with a slender minaret, lies on a hill on the right bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road then leads through olive-woods and vineyards to
(12 M.) <b>Testour</b>, on the site of the Roman <i>Tichilla</i>, now a little
town of 3500 inhab., mostly descendants of Andalusian Moors, with
thriving potteries and a large Friday market.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cross the <i>Oued Siliana</i>, not far from its influx into the

and a Byzantine fortress.</p>

<p class='c011'>We descend, in sight of Teboursouk and the distant capitol of
Dougga, into the valley of the Oued Khalled. We pass through
many side-valleys, cross the river, and then ascend a branch of
the road to the right, soon joining the Gaffour road (p. <a href='#Page_360'>360</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>28 M. <b>Teboursouk</b> (1378 ft.; Hôt. International, R. 3½)

(incl. 300 Europeans) has a fine open site on the olive-clad slope
of <i>Kef Teboursouk</i>, high above the valley of the <i>Oued Zebbès</i>.
Into the walls of the narrow and picturesque streets are built many
fragments from the ruins of the once considerable town of <i>Thubursicum
Bure</i>. We note also the <i>Byzantine Fortress</i> (with remains
of a Roman triumphal arch in its N. wall) and the <i>Neo-Punic
Burial Ground</i>, to the S.W. of the town. A superb distant view
is obtained at the ruined tower at the upper end of the town.</p>

<p class='c016'>The rough, hilly road from <i>Pont-de-Trajan</i> (p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>) to Teboursouk
leads through the rugged hill-region to the S. of the Medjerda, and passes
(12½ M.) <i>Henchir Maâtria</i>, the ruins of the small Roman town of <i>Numluli</i>
or <i>Numiulis</i> (foundations of the capitol of 170 A.D., early-Christian
chapel in quatrefoil form with four apses, and Byzantine fort). It ends
at the N. gate of (17½ M.) <i>Teboursouk</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Road to Dougga</span>, 3¾ M. from Teboursouk, leaves the Le

plateau thinly overgrown with scrub.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Dougga</b> (about 1970 ft.), a poor Berber village on the S. margin
of <i>Kef Dougga</i>, is the ancient <i>Thugga</i>, one of the oldest
and most important places in the heart of Tunisia. The site of the
ruins, which vie with those of Gightis (p. <a href='#Page_392'>392</a>), is the most beautiful
in the whole country. The name is of Berber origin (<i>thukka</i>,
pasture). It appears to have been the seat of a Berber dynasty
allied with Carthage. It then belonged successively to the Carthaginian
dominions and to those of Masinissa (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>), and attained
its prime about the end of the 2nd cent. A.D. The grand late-Roman
ruins, partly excavated since 1891, the venerable olive-woods
on Kef Dougga, and the view of the Oued Khalled valley
and of the N. Tunisian hills, stretching far away to Jebel Zaghouan
and Jebel Bou-Kornin (p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>), combine to form a fascinating picture.
On the N.W. horizon is <i>Jebel Gorra</i> (3160 ft.), famed ever
since ancient times for its lead and zinc mines.</p>

*<b>Mausoleum</b> of a Berber prince (5th or 4th cent. B.C.), probably
the oldest existing Punic-Libyan monument of the kind.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Built in the style of the Egyptian and Syrian tombs of kings, the
mausoleum, originally about 55 ft. high, consisted of a pile of huge limestone
blocks. The substructure, resting on a foundation of six steps, is
adorned with narrow corner-pillars and three blind windows. The middle
part, which is square, rises above three steps and has two portals flanked
with Ionic mural columns and an Egyptian concave moulding instead of
a cornice. Three more steps, once embellished at the angles with figures
on horseback, bore a small pyramid crowned with the figure of a lion.
The upper part was unfortunately destroyed in 1842 by natives employed
by Sir T. Reade, with the bey’s permission, to remove the inscription
in the Phœnician and the Libyan language, which is now in the British
Museum. The monument, however, has been recently completely restored
The tomb-chamber is probably underneath the monument.</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing through the village, to the W., we come to the ruins
of other <i>Thermae</i> and the so-called <i>Dâr el-Acheb</i>, a Roman building
of some kind, of which the steps and façade alone remain.
We ascend thence to the N.E., past the foundations of <i>Roman
Houses</i>, to the hill of the Capitol.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Capitol</b> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_288'>288</a>), the conspicuous landmark of
Dougga, is one of the finest ruined temples in Tunisia, vying with
the three temples of Sbeïtla (p. <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>). It is a Corinthian pseudo-peripteros,
with a lofty flight of eleven steps and a portico of six
columns, 43 ft. high and 24 ft. deep, the whole consisting of great
limestone blocks. The square cella, 15 by 14 yds., has been destroyed,
with the exception of the portal and the stone-panelled
back-wall, with its semicircular niche in the centre and two square
side-niches for images. The inscription on the frieze of the portico,
of the time of Marcus Aurelius (166–9 A.D.), names two citizens
of Thugga as the founders. In the Byzantine period the temple
formed the nucleus of the citadel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Roman Theatre</b>, on the hill-side a little to the E. of the
Capitol, is not only the best-preserved in N. Africa but is unique
in the richness and beauty of its embellishment. The twenty-five
tiers of seats in the Cavea, or auditorium, are almost intact, except
that the upper colonnade has fallen into the orchestra. The stage
(pulpitum) still has the old pavement, the front-wall, articulated
like similar structures in Algeria, and the superb rear wall, with
its three niches and remains of rich columnar decoration. The
founder of the building, as recorded by the inscription now lying
on the ground, was the flamen perpetuus L. Marcius Quadratus.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the <i>Forum</i> and of the street connecting it with the Capitol
fragments of the pavement only have been unearthed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Temple of Cælestis</b>, in the olive-wood to the N.W. of the
Capitol, is the strangest ruin at Dougga. The crescent-shaped court
represents the half-moon, the symbol of the Punic goddess Tanit,
or Astarte, whose name was Latinized in the Roman period.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ruin stands on the hill-side, supported by huge substructures.
The court terminated in a rectangular antechamber, 46 by 20 yds. The two
entrances, with dedicatory inscriptions, lay at the sides, preceded by
square chambers (or towers). The semicircular wall of the court (57 yds.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>in diameter), in concrete, is partly preserved. A large hall here, with two
corner-pillars and twenty-three Corinthian columns, formed along with the
antechamber the meeting-place of the congregation. The temple itself,
in the centre of the court, which was probably planted with trees, was
a rectangle of 18½ by 10½ yds., but its foundations alone survive. The
flight of steps and the two semicircular apses at the back of the cella date
from a restoration in the Byzantine period. The inscription names a
wealthy citizen of the time of Alex. Severus as the founder (222–35).</p>

<p class='c009'>We next walk through olive-wood to the E. to the <i>Roman Cisterns</i>,
once fed by the partly preserved aqueduct of Aïn el-Hammam
(S.W. of Dougga), and then, past the ancient N. gate of the town, the
<i>Arch of Alexander Severus</i>, called by the Arabs <i>Bâb er-Rûmia</i>
(‘gate of the Christian woman’), to the ruins of the <i>Numidic Citadel</i>
and the <i>Roman Hippodrome</i>. Near this is the ancient <i>Berber
Burial Ground</i>, containing several dolmens.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the steep slope of a bare hill to the N.N.E. of the Theatre,
and once no less conspicuous than the Capitol, was enthroned the
<b>Temple of Saturn</b>, founded by a rich citizen in 195 A.D. The
ruin probably stands on the site of a Punic temple of Baal Hâman.
The peculiar ground-plan is reminiscent of the Phœnician temples,
whose open colonnaded courts contained altars for burnt offerings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pronaos or vestibule, resembling a corridor, to which there
was an approach at the S. end only, had a portico of four Corinthian
columns facing the E., high above the Oued Khalled; but of all this
there are but scanty traces. From the pronaos a small gate admitted
into a quadrangle, paved with limestone slabs, and enclosed on
three sides by Corinthian colonnades. On the W. side these were
divided by partitions into three sections, forming ante-rooms to the
three cellæ. The raised central cella, once railed in, was the chief
shrine, richly adorned with wall-paintings and reliefs in stucco.</p>

Farther on, leaving the zinc-mines of <i>Jebel Fedj el-Adoum</i> on one side,

of <i>Jebel Bou-Kornin</i> (p. <a href='#Page_363'>363</a>). Crétéville lies on the road from Tunis to
Grombalia (p. <a href='#Page_364'>364</a>), near the grand <i>Khanguet el-Hadjadj</i> (‘pilgrim-pass’),
a deep ravine between Jebel Bou-Kornin and Jebel Ressas (see below),
through which formerly passed the traffic between the interior and the
harbours on the E. seaboard. In this defile, now clothed with vineyards,
lay the little town of <i>Neferis</i>, which was destroyed by the Romans at
the same time as Carthage. 17½ M. (from Tunis) <i>La Laverie</i> (377 ft.)
is a village of Italian miners, at the W. foot of <i>Jebel Ressas</i> (2608 ft.;

<p class='c009'>Beyond (8 M.) <i>Nassen</i> we cross the Miliane. 12½ M. <i>Khledia.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>15 M. <b>Oudna.</b> In the hill-country, ½ hr. to the S.E., is
the large Ferme Ducroquet, situated among the ruins of <i>Uthina</i>,
one of the wealthiest towns of N. Tunisia in the Roman age. Of
the public buildings nothing remains but the <i>Cisterns</i> and scanty
traces of the <i>Theatre</i> and <i>Amphitheatre</i>. Among the ruins of private
houses is the <i>Palace of the Laberii</i> (end of 3rd cent. A.D.),
a fine specimen of a sumptuous African-Roman dwelling, with a
large peristyle as its centre (comp. p. <a href='#Page_290'>290</a>) and numerous mosaics
(now mostly in the Bardo Museum). The adjoining Balineum
(baths) was long used, from the 5th cent. onwards, as a potter’s
workshop. Fine view from the highest hill (407 ft.); on a lower
hill is a <i>Byzantine Fortress</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Oudna the line intersects the Roman *<i>Aqueduct of

(525 ft.), the only intermediate station, the two Roman aqueducts and the
modern conduits (p. <a href='#Page_339'>339</a>) from Jebel Zaghouan and Jebel Djouggar unite.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Road from Tunis to Zaghouan</span> (34½ M.) leads past the <i>Abattoirs</i>
(beyond Pl. E, 7) and the <i>Sebkha es-Sedjoumi</i> (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>) to (8 M.) <i>La Mohamédia</i>,
a poor village, with the decayed residence of Ahmed Bey
(p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>). It crosses the Oued Miliane near the arches of the Roman aqueduct,
here 66 ft. high, and beyond <i>Bou er-Rébia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>) leads along the E.
slope of Jebel Oust to (34½ M.) Zaghouan. A branch of the road from
La Mohamédia, passing <i>Oudna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>), also leads to Zaghouan.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Zaghouan</b> (821 ft.; Hôt. de France, déj. 3 fr., plain but quite good,
orders should be given in advance; pop. 1200, incl. 530 Europeans, mostly
Ital.), Arab. <i>Zaghwân</i>, a charming place, specially in spring, lies amidst
olives, oranges, and cypresses on a terrace at the foot of Jebel Zaghouan
(see below), ¼ hr. above the station. The Roman <i>Triumphal Arch</i>, at the
entrance to the village, is the sole relic of the small town of <i>Onellana</i> (<i>?</i>);
the columns of the nymphæum now adorn the <i>Chief Mosque</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>We may thence walk in ½ hr. to the <i>Prise d’Eau</i> (902 ft.), the reservoir
of the new conduit which supplies both Zaghouan and Tunis with
water from the <i>Aïn Ayed</i>. The direct route leads from the station past the
barracks of the tirailleurs; or we may follow a rough but romantic path
from the little town, through a secluded valley, where numerous nightingales
nest among the oleander-bushes by the bed of the stream. From
the Prise d’Eau a rocky path leads to the S.W. to the (12 min.) *<span class='sc'>Nymphæum</span>
(<i>Temple des Eaux</i>; Arabic <i>Henchir Aïn-Kasba</i>, ‘ruined castle of the
fountain’), the well-house of the Carthage aqueduct (p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>), shaded by
groups of splendid old trees. Near the basin are two flights of steps leading
to the semicircle of the fountain-shrine, with its colonnade, twenty-four
empty niches for statues, and a domed central chamber, the ante-room
of the cella.</p>

<p class='c022'>*<b>Jebel Zaghouan</b> (4245 ft.), the ancient <i>Mons Ziquensis</i>, the finest
mountain in Tunisia, offers from the summit, called <i>Râs el-Kasa</i>, a superb
panorama of the greater part of N. Tunisia and of the E. coast as far
as Susa. It is ascended from the Nymphæum path in 4 hrs., past the
kubba of <i>Sidi Sala Bou-Ghobrin</i> (2264 ft.) and the zinc-mines (with their
humble canteen), and lastly by rough and toilsome paths. Less extensive,
but also very grand, is the view near the <i>Poste Optique</i> (3199 ft.), 2 hrs.
above the Prise d’Eau (bridle-path; mule 2–3 fr.).</p>

<p class='c009'>Our train, running to the S.W. with a fine view of Jebel
Zaghouan on the left, now intersects the Smindja plain and reaches
the <i>Fahs er-Riah</i>, the fertile upper basin of the valley of the
Oued Miliane, which is here formed by the <i>Oued Jarabia</i> and the
<i>Oued el-Kébir</i>. Its inhabitants are of the Riah tribe, descendants
of the Beni Hilal (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>40 M. <i>Pont-du-Fahs</i> (574 ft.). The village (Hôt. Calega, poor),
occupied by immigrants, lies ½ hr. to the N.E., on the left bank of
the Miliane. Behind it, on the spurs of <i>Jebel Djaffar</i> (1185 ft.),
are the extensive ruins of <i>Henchir-Kasbat</i> (702 ft.), the ancient
<i>Thuburbo Majus</i>; in the forum are two ruined temples, one of
them, dedicated to Mercury, dating from 211 A.D.; there are also
triumphal arches, thermæ, and a Byzantine fortress.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the right rises the curiously shaped <i>Jebel Klab</i> (1204 ft.).
We cross the Oued el-Kébir and run to the W. through the Jarabia
valley to (48½ M.) <i>Tarf ech-Chena</i>, 3 M. to the N.W. of <i>Apisa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Majus</i>. Farther on almost the only habitations visible are the
tents and gourbis (twig-huts) of nomadic tribes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond (55½ M.) <i>Bou-Arada</i> we cross the watershed between
the Oued Miliane and the <i>Oued Siliana</i> (p. <a href='#Page_354'>354</a>).</p>

Oued Siliana. We then ascend the winding valley to the S.W.</p>

<p class='c011'>75 M. <b>Gaffour</b> (about 1080 ft.; Rail. Restaurant, with rooms),
with its railway-works, is the station for the large estate of the
Société Foncière de Tunisie, 72,500 acres in area, where extensive
corn-fields are seen in spring. From Gaffour a road, tolerably fit
for driving in dry weather, leads over <i>Jebel Sidi Abdalla Ben-Cheid</i>
(2070 ft.) to <i>Teboursouk</i> (Dougga; comp. p. <a href='#Page_354'>354</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>82 M. <i>El-Akhouat</i>, in the valley of the <i>Oued Soufi</i>, near the

<p class='c011'>93 M. <i>Sidi Bou-Rouis</i>, on the <i>Oued Tessa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>), which
here forms a wide bend to the E. round <i>Jebel Maïza</i> (2920 ft.).
To the left rises the chain of <i>Jebel Massouge</i> (3019 ft.). 103 M.
<i>Le Sers</i>, on the N. margin of the broad dale of that name (Arabic
<i>Bled es-Sers</i>), one of the most fertile inland districts in Tunisia.</p>

<p class='c011'>106 M. <b>Les Salines</b> (Rail. Restaurant), junction for Kalaâ-Djerda
(see p. <a href='#Page_361'>361</a>), lies on the highroad from Le Kef to Souk et-Tléta
and on a rough road to (19 M.) Maktar.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Maktar</b> (3117 ft.; inn), the <i>Maktarium</i> of the Libyans and the <i>Ælia
Aurelia Augusta Mactaris</i> of the Romans, to the W. of the richly wooded
<i>Hammada Kessera</i>, is now a small village of ‘colonists’ with a fortified
bordj (Contrôle Civil; containing an epigraphical collection), and is the
administrative centre for the district of the Ouled Aoun and Ouled Ayar.
Extensive orchards and Sunday market. Among the antiquities are numerous
dolmens, Roman ruins (arch of Trajan of 116 A.D., mausolea, an
aqueduct, etc.), and an early-Christian basilica.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train next ascends to the N.W., between Jebel Maïza, on
the right, and <i>Jebel Lorbeus</i> (2641 ft.), on the left, and crosses
the <i>Oued Lorbeus</i>, up whose valley once lay the Roman <i>Lares</i>,
later <i>Lorbeus</i>, a small town destroyed in 1048 by the Hilalides
(p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>).—118 M. <i>Zafran</i>, on the spurs of <i>Jebel Zafran</i>. Traversing
the bleak mountain plain of <i>Bled Zafran</i> we soon have a
fine view of Le Kef and the barren <i>Dyr el-Kef</i> (p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>125½ M. <b>Le Kef</b> (2477 ft.; Hôt. Dalban, Milano, etc., very
plain; pop. 7000, incl. 1400 Europeans, 900 of them Italians),
superbly situated near an abrupt rocky slope, the S.W. spur of
Dyr el-Kef, was down to modern times the chief town in W. Tunisia.
In its earliest period it was famed for its temple of Astarte. After
the first Punic war the discontented mercenaries (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>) were banished
hither. Under Augustus the town became a Roman colony
named <i>Sicca</i>, with the cognomen of <i>Veneria</i> derived from its temple
of Venus. Under the later Roman empire it was of great strategic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>importance, lying at the junction of the roads to Thacia (p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>),
Theveste (Tebessa), Thagaste (p. <a href='#Page_313'>313</a>), and Simitthu (p. <a href='#Page_326'>326</a>); by
the Arabs it was even regarded as the key of Algeria. During the
Turkish period fierce battles were fought under its walls (in 1694,
1705, and 1807) between the beys of Tunisia and Algeria, and
during the French advance in 1881 Le Kef was hardly a less important
objective than Tunis itself. Since then the mosques have
been open to visitors (tickets at the Contrôle Civil).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the station (omnibus) we ascend through the new European
quarter, with its red-tiled roofs, to (20 min.) the Boulevard de Tunis,
once the rampart on the N.W. side of the town, where we have an
extensive view. The only Roman ruins are the basin of <i>Aïn el-Kef</i>
and the <i>Thermae</i> at the W. angle of the old town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old town, still enclosed on three sides by the mouldering
Turkish wall, consists of narrow and irregular streets built partly
out of Roman and Byzantine ruins. The old <i>Dâr el-Bey</i> is now
the Hôtel de Ville. The <i>Chief Mosque</i> (Djamâa el-Kebîra) is built
into the ruins of an early-Christian basilica (?).</p>

<p class='c011'>The early-Christian *<span class='sc'>Church of St. Peter</span> (Arabic <i>Dâr el-Kuss</i>)
was a small columnar basilica of the early 5th cent, with
nave and aisles (23 by 10½ yds.); but the narthex (vestibule, now
used as a church) and the fine choir-recess have alone been left
standing. Many Roman sculptures, mostly from a temple, have been
built into the walls of the aisles, which were originally vaulted.
The nave, which once had a timber roof, retains relics of its old
mosaic pavement.</p>

<p class='c011'>The zaouïa of <i>Sidi Kaddour el-Mizouni</i>, one of the three
largest Tunisian establishments of the widely diffused Mohammedan
brotherhood of the Kadria (p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>), enjoys a high reputation.
The zaouïa of <i>Sidi Salah ben-Aïssa</i>, belonging to the Rahmania,
contains a fine modern cenotaph of the saint.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steep lanes and passages in steps connect the old town with the
Turkish <i>Kasba</i> (now barracks).</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the town is a third early-Christian church, the so-called
<i>Kasr el-Ghûla</i> (‘castle of ghosts’). The <i>Roman Cisterns</i> to the

(19½ M.) the mines of <i>Slata</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train next passes over the saddle between the lofty plateau
of <i>Khremensa</i>, rich in phosphates, on the right, and <i>Jebel Ayata</i>
(3480 ft.), on the left, and then descends past <i>Jebel Zrissa</i>, on the
right, with its iron-mines, into the valley of the <i>Oued Sarrath</i>, the
chief feeder of the Oued Mellègue (p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>138½ M. <i>Oued-Sarrath</i> (ca. 1900 ft.), on the right bank.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Branch Line</span> from Oued-Sarrath (18½ M., in 1¼–1¾ hr.) down the left
bank of the Sarrath viâ <i>Majouba</i> to <b>Kalaât es-Senam</b> (Hôt. de Jugurtha),
the station for the great phosphate deposits of the Comp. des Phosphates
du Dyr on the <i>Jebel Kalaât es-Senam</i> (4111 ft.). The top of the
huge mountain, conspicuous far and wide, consists of a tableland, occupied
by a deserted Berber village and an old Byzantine fort, accessible only by
steep paths with steps.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train skirts the Sarrath and then ascends the side-valley
of <i>Oued Haidra</i>. On the left, <i>Jebel Bou el-Hanèche</i> (4040 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>146 M. <b>Kalaâ-Djerda</b> (about 2130 ft.; hotel), near the rich
phosphate mines of an Italian company on the hills of that name
(2886 ft.).</p>

<p class='c016'>A most interesting excursion may be taken to (11 M.) <b>Haidra</b> (about
2790 ft.), the Tunisian frontier custom-house, on the site of <i>Ammaedara</i>
(<i>Colonia Augusta Emerita Ammaedara</i>), founded perhaps by Vespasian
as a Roman colony of veterans, and in the later Roman age no less important
than Tebessa. Originally a frontier-fortress it was, like Timgad
(p. <a href='#Page_289'>289</a>), a model Roman camp. The Carthage and Tebessa road formed
the Decumanus Maximus and the Kasserine and Gafsa road the Cardo
Maximus. On the left bank the ruins have partly fallen into the bed
of the Oued Haidra. The much smaller suburb lay on the right bank.
The castellated *<i>Byzantine Fortress</i> of the time of Justinian (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>), the
largest in N. Africa, was built to guard the passage of the stream.
Within the vast enclosure, 219 by 120 yds., are remains of a Byzantine
basilica, cisterns, etc.—The imposing *<i>Triumphal Arch</i> of the time of
Septimius Severus (p. <a href='#Page_407'>407</a>) was used by the Byzantines as a fort also.
Near it are an early-Christian <i>Basilica</i>, with aisles and extensive Byzantine
additions (curious, unexplained holes in the masonry; comp. p. <a href='#Page_317'>317</a>),
and a second <i>Basilica</i> with double aisles and numerous tombstones. A
column, 33 ft. high, is the sole relic of a Roman <i>Temple</i>, the only one of
which there is a trace. High above the stream, almost intact, rises a Roman
*<i>Mausoleum</i>, with an open loggia on the upper story.—From Haidra over
(10½ M.) <i>Jebel Kouïf</i> to (26 M.) <i>Tebessa</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_318'>318</a>.</p>

<p class='c022'>A <span class='sc'>Road</span> leads from Kalaâ-Djerda to <i>Kasserine</i> (43 M.; diligence to
Thala daily, thence to Kasserine on Tues. and Frid. only) over the central
Sahara Atlas (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>) and through the valley of the <i>Oued Hathob</i> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>),
by which of old the Arabs invaded Algeria. (From Kasserine to Feriana,
see p. <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>.) The only village on the route, as in the time of Marius (p. <a href='#Page_384'>384</a>)
it was the only settlement between Lares (p. <a href='#Page_360'>360</a>) and Gafsa, is (8¾ M.)
Thala (3337 ft.; Hôt. Recli, Hôt. Gros, both rustic; pop. 800, incl. 80 Europeans),
which holds market (Sat.–Mon.) for the Arab-like Berber tribes of
the Fraichich (the Frexes of Ptolemy) and Madjeur. It lies on the N.E.
slope of <i>Jebel Char</i> (4321 ft.), 40½ M. to the N.E. of Tebessa (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>).
The Roman antiquities of the town, which was most prosperous under
Diocletian, are uninteresting. Near the Esplanade, in the centre of the
Roman town, are traces of a temple of Cælestis (p. <a href='#Page_356'>356</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>From Tunis to (2½ M.) <i>Djebel-Djelloud</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>. Our train
turns to the E. to (3¾ M.) <i>Mégrine</i>, a station amidst vineyards.
Pretty views of Tunis, behind us, to the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>6¼ M. <i>Maxula-Rades</i>, in a marshy site, at the S. end of the
tongue of land between Lake Bahira (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>) and the open sea.
On a height, ¼ hr. to the S. of the station, lies the picturesque
little town of <b>Rades</b>, which, like Sidi Bou-Saïd (p. <a href='#Page_351'>351</a>), is a
favourite summer residence of the wealthy Moslems of Tunis. Near
the <i>Fort</i> (184 ft.) behind the town we have a splendid view of
Lake Bahira, the hills of Carthage, the bay of Tunis, and the fertile
Mornag (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of the station lies <i>Maxula</i>, a colony of the villas of
European families in Tunis, on the site of the Roman town of that
name. A road leads thence to (1¼ M.; tramway in summer) the
bathing-beach on the bay of Tunis.</p>

<p class='c016'>A <span class='sc'>Road</span>, enlivened by many vehicles, especially on Sundays and
holidays, leads from Maxula to (3½ M.) <i>Goletta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_343'>343</a>). It runs to the
N. through the isthmus, past swamps and fig-gardens, and, on the left,
past large salt-ponds, where in summer salt is obtained by evaporation,
and finally it skirts the sea. About an hour’s walk brings us to the steam-ferry
(bac à vapeur; free) across the new <i>Bahira Canal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>), opposite
the station of the electric tramway to Carthage (p. <a href='#Page_343'>343</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>We cross the <i>Oued Miliane</i> (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>), below a five-arched bridge
(1749; not visible from the train) and close to the shore, which is
here marshy at places.</p>

<p class='c011'>10½ M. <b>Hammam-Lif</b> (Hôt. de Paris, near the sea, plain;
Terminus Hôt., near the station, humble; pop. 1000, incl. 650 Italians),
formerly oftener called <i>Hammam el-Enf</i>, the ancient <i>Naro</i>,
is prettily situated at the N. base of Jebel Bou-Kornin (see below).
On the wooded slope, to the right of the railway, where the hot
salt-springs rise (117–120° Fahr.), is the old <i>Dâr el-Bey</i>, a palace
now converted into barracks, on the foundations of the Roman baths
<i>Aquae Persianae</i>, so called from the founder, C. Julius Perseus.
Near it is the ‘<i>Fondouk</i>‘, the modern unpretending bath-house. Of
the late-Roman <i>Synagogue</i> (3rd cent.), discovered here in 1883,
scarcely a trace is left.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N.E. of the station is (¼ M.) the <i>Bathing Beach</i>, with
a summer casino. Fine view of Goletta, the Carthage hills, and
the peninsula of Cape Bon.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<b>Jebel Bou-Kornin</b>, or <i>Bou-Kournine</i>, so named from its two
‘horns’, the W. (1890 ft.) and the E. (1626 ft.), separated by a deep hollow,
commands a splendid panorama of N. Tunisia. The W. peak, once crowned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>with a temple of Saturnus Balcaranenis (Saturn-Baal of Mt. Karnaïm),
the most famous shrine of Baal in the land, is ascended by a new bridle-path
on the E. slope or by a steep old path on the W. margin of the N.
spur (925 ft.).</p>

<p class='c009'>A little farther on we pass between the eucalyptus groves and
vineyards of the estate of <i>Potinville</i>, where many negroes are employed,
to (15 M.) <i>Bordj Cédria</i>. To the left we sight Jebel Korbous
(see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>The train next runs to the N.E. across the <i>Plain of Soliman</i>
(see below), a depression between the main chain of the Sahara
Atlas (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>) and the hills of the peninsula of <i>Cape Bon</i>, passing
at first through a steppe where browsing camels are often seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>18 M. <i>Fondouk Djedid</i>, a village of immigrant settlers on the
wooded spurs of <i>Jebel Zaïana</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>From Fondouk Djedid to Menzel Bou-Zelfa</span>, 8½ M., branch-line in
¾ hr. (through-carr. from Tunis to Soliman by the morning train; return-fares
5 fr. 80, 4 fr. 15, 2 fr. 55 c.). Also from Tunis (Auto-Palace, p. <a href='#Page_330'>330</a>)
motor-omnibus Sun. and Thurs. at 8.30 a.m., in 1½ hr. (fare 8, return
10 fr.). The only intermediate station is <b>Soliman</b> (145 ft.; Hôt. Zammit,
humble; pop. 2200, incl. 150 Europeans; Frid. market), a picturesque little
town founded by Andalusian Moors in 1616, with a lofty minaret. Thence
through venerable olive-woods to <i>Menzel Bou-Zelfa</i> (or <i>Zalfa</i>; 197 ft.),
famed for its luxuriant orchards, with a zaouïa of the Kadria brotherhood
and an important cattle-market (Thurs.).</p>

<p class='c022'>A <span class='sc'>Road from Soliman</span>, where a hotel-omnibus from Korbous meets
the morning train (fare to Korbous 2, there and back 3, luggage 1 fr.;
other vehicles also), leads at first to the N.E. through pleasant olive-groves,
and then, beyond the <i>Oued Bezirk</i>, runs behind the low coast-dunes
to <i>Mraïssa</i>, the ruins of the little Roman town of <i>Carpis</i>. At
(7½ M.) the kubba of <i>Sidi Raïs</i>, near which are seen fragments of walls
of the harbour of Carpis, begins the new coast-road to Korbous. This skirts
the rocky slopes of <i>Jebel Korbous</i> (1375 ft.), being strongly buttressed
at places, and affords a delightful view, especially in the morning, of
Tunis, the Carthage hills, and the W. shore of the bay as far as Cape
Farina (p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>). 11 M. <b>Korbous</b> (Hôt. des Thermes, R. 2–6, B. 1, déj. 3½,
D. 4, pens, from 10 fr.), a small watering-place, and of late a winter
resort also, has hot springs (alkaline and saline, 111–151° Fahr.), an old
palace of the beys situated on the shore and now used as a bath-house,
and scanty ruins of the Roman baths (<i>Aquae Carpitanae</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>22 M. <i>Khanguet</i>, for Khanguet el-Hadjadj (p. <a href='#Page_358'>358</a>); 23½ M.
<i>Grombalia</i> (154 ft.), a village of colonists; 30 M. <i>Bou-Arkoub</i>
(236 ft.). We then cross the watershed between the bay of Tunis
and the <i>Gulf of Hammamet</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>37½ M. <b>Bir Bou-Rekba</b> (Rail. Restaurant), at the foot of
bare hills, 10 min. to the W. of <i>Kasr ez-Zit</i>, the ruins of <i>Siagu</i>
(early-Christian basilica, Byzantine fort, etc.).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>From Bir Bou-Rekba to Nabeul</span>, 11 M., branch-line in about ¾ hr.
(1 fr. 90, 1 fr. 45 c., 1 fr.). The only intermediate station is (2½ M.) <b>Hammamet</b>
(82 ft.; Hôt. de la Plage, on the shore, R. 2 fr., B. 60 c., déj. or
D. 2, pens. 5–6 fr., quite good; pop. 6000, incl. 200 Europeans; Wed. market),
most picturesquely situated on a small headland, ¼ hr. to the S. of
the station. The ramparts of the ruinous <i>Kasba</i> (now partly a Poste
Optique) afford a charming view of the bay as far as Hergla (p. <a href='#Page_365'>365</a>).
Pretty bathing-beach. The coast between Hammamet and Nabeul has
unfortunately been entirely denuded of wood, but the climate in winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>is the mildest and healthiest in Tunisia next to that of Djerba (p. <a href='#Page_393'>393</a>).
The lemons, mandarins, oranges, and other fruits are considered the
best in the land. The finest *Fruit Gardens, some of them shaded by
groups of old cypresses, lie to the W., in the direction of the ruins of
<i>Pupput</i>, now called <i>Souk el-Abiod</i>, and also on the Nabeul road.—Beyond
Hammamet the train crosses numerous torrents.</p>

<p class='c022'>11 M. <b>Nabeul</b> (43 ft.; Hôt. de France, R., déj., D. 2½ fr. each, omn.
½ fr., good; Hôt. des Voyageurs; carr. to Hammamet 5–6 fr.; pop. 11,900,
incl. 2000 Jews and 400 Europeans; Frid. market), with its small <i>Souks</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>) and pretty gardens, is the chief town on this part of the coast.
Its famed old pottery is again thriving. Fayence with geometrical patterns,
after Punic and late-Roman models, and porous, unglazed water-jugs (gargoulettes)
are the chief products. The small <i>Poterie Artistique</i> (Tissier’s),
behind the church, is worth seeing. Pleasant walks are to the N.E.
to (20 min.) <i>Dar-Chabane</i>, a purely Moslem village; to the S. to the
small anchorage near the kubba <i>Sidi Slîmân</i>, or to the ruins of <i>Neapolis</i>,
now largely submerged; a little seaport destroyed at the same time
as Carthage (146 B.C.), to which Nabeul owes its name and much of its
building-material; to the E. to (3¾ M.) <i>El-Mamoura</i>, near the caverns
in the <i>Râs Mamoura</i>, the N.E. boundary of the bay of Hammamet; to
the N. to the (½ hr.) <i>Râs Tefal</i>, where the potters dig their clay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Susa Train</span> turns to the S.E., quitting the highroad, on
which, beyond <i>Pupput</i> (see above), is the so-called <i>Kasr Menara</i>,
a large Roman circular building resembling the tomb of Cæcilia
Metella, the only monument of the kind in Barbary. We approach
the spurs of the Sahara Atlas. All around is scanty underwood,
with occasional tents of nomads and many pasturing cattle. To
the left we have a glimpse of the N. coast of the bay as far as
Nabeul (see above). To the W. towers <i>Jebel Zaghouan</i> (p. <a href='#Page_359'>359</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the <i>Oued er-Rebia</i>, at (49 M.) <i>Bou-Ficha</i>, begins the
<b>Enfida</b>, an estate of 300,000 acres owned by the Société Franco-Africaine,
the ancient granary of central Tunisia, but a wilderness
for centuries after the irruption of the Beni Hilal (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>). Among
the farm-labourers are many Sicilians. There are still, however,
great desolate tracts, dotted with Roman ruins and old irrigation-works,
inhabited only by the nomadic <i>Oulad Saïd</i>, descendants
of the Hilalides.</p>

<p class='c011'>54½ M. <i>Aïn-Hallouf</i>, near the ruins of <i>Aphrodisium</i>, now
<i>Sidi Khalifa</i> and <i>Henchir Fradiz</i>, close to the salt-marshes of
the <i>Sebkha Djiriba</i>, which are 19 M. long.</p>

<p class='c011'>62 M. <b>Enfidaville</b> (131 ft.; Rail. Restaurant; Hôt. d’Enfidaville,
déj. 2½ fr., well spoken of; pop. 6700, incl. 500 Europeans),
a rising town of colonists, the largest in the Enfida, is a pretty
oasis of trees and vegetable-gardens. Alfa (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>) is largely exported.
Near the station is a village of nomad-tents.</p>

<p class='c016'>Above the Zaghouan road (p. <a href='#Page_359'>359</a>), about 4 M. to the W. of Enfidaville,
on <i>Jebel Takroun</i> (657 ft.), is perched the interesting Berber
village of <i>Takrouna</i> (pop. about 500), not easily accessible.—In the
valley of the <i>Oued Boul</i>, 7½ M. to the W. of Enfidaville, on <i>Jebel Garci</i>,
rises the chalybeate spring of <i>Aïn-Garci</i>, on the site of the Roman
<i>Aggersel</i>.—Some 9½ M. to the S.E. of Enfidaville lies <i>Hergla</i> (reached
also by a branch of the road from Sidi Bou-Ali; see p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>), the ancient
<i>Horrea Caelia</i>, the corn-mart and export-harbour of the Enfida.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>The steppe-like character of the landscape again asserts itself.
Wild asparagus abounds. To the right in the distance are the bare
hills of central Tunisia behind Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>). 71 M. <i>Menzel
Dar el-Bouar</i>, not far from the <i>Sebkha Halk el-Menzel</i>. On the
road, to the N.E. of the station, is an ancient Berber cemetery,
with numerous dolmens (p. <a href='#Page_324'>324</a>), mostly ruined of late.</p>

<p class='c011'>76½ M. <i>Sidi Bou-Ali</i>, a smiling oasis, with olive and fruit-trees
and a few date-palms. We again traverse a stony hill-region,
dotted with stunted olive-trees, and then descend into the thickly
peopled <i>Sahel</i> (see below), with its many thriving little towns.</p>

<p class='c011'>85 M. <i>Kalaâ-Kebira</i> (161 ft.; pop. 6500). To the left, farther
on, we see the little town of <i>Akouda</i>, on a low hill; then the
distant <i>Hammam-Sousse</i> in the valley of the <i>Oued Laya</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>88 M. <i>Kalaâ-Srira</i> (181 ft.; Rail. Restaurant), on the right

also the capital of the <i>Sahel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>). This coast-region, 20–25 M.
in breadth, famed in the Roman age for its olive-oil, yields corn
also, like the inland plain of Kairwan, although its rainfall is slight.
According to the latest statistics the Sahel has 6 million olive-trees,
212,000 acres of barley, and about 4000 date-palms, which here,
however, mostly yield date-wine (‘lagmi’) only. As yet the manufacturing
industries are practically limited to the oil-mills and soap-works

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Susa, the Roman <i>Hadrumetum</i>, is one of the oldest Phœnician colonies
on the coast of Tunisia. It appears for the first time in history at
the end of the second Punic war, when it was Hannibal’s base of operations,
and, after the battle of Zama (B. C. 202), his place of refuge. It
escaped the fate of Carthage in 146 B. C., and it was again spared a century
later, although it had sided with Pompey in the civil war. Under the
later Roman empire Hadrumetum was remarkably prosperous, being the
great outlet for the produce of the numerous and thickly peopled inland
colonies as far as Tebessa. The fertility of its environs is indicated by
the name given to it when re-colonized under Trajan (Colonia Concordia
Ulpia Trajana Frugifera Hadrumentina). At that period the whole coast
from Hadrumetum to El-Alia and Chebba (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>) was bordered with
sumptuous country-houses. After its conquest by the Arabs (in 665, and
again in 689) Susa, whose present name is said to date from the 8th cent.,
was outstripped by Kairwan and Mehdia. It afterwards suffered severely
from the irruption of the Hilalides (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) and its conquest by the Normans
(1135), and in more modern times from its bombardment by the
Spaniards (1537 and 1550), the French (1769), and the Venetians (1783).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Harbour</span>, 35 acres in area, constructed in 1886–9, is
tolerably sheltered by two moles and by the <i>Grande Jetée</i> (737 yds.),
the end of which is a splendid point of view. The <i>Digue Sud</i> (Pl.
D, 4, 5), where new harbour-works are in progress, is occupied by
storehouses for the phosphates from Aïn-Moularès (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the N. mole and the dunes of <i>Bou-Jaffar</i>, near the
Punic-Roman harbour (Kothon), of which scarcely a trace is left,
lies the new town, dating from 1881. The busy parts of it are the
Rond-Point de la Douane (Pl. D, 2), near the steamboat-quay, and
the <span class='sc'>Place Pichon</span> (Pl. C, D, 2), from which the Boul. René Millet
leads to the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the two small public gardens here is the *<b>Museum</b>
(Pl. C, 2), a valuable collection of Punic, Roman, and early-Christian
antiquities, mostly excavated of late in the Sahel. Adm. daily, except
Mon., 8–11 and 2–4 (from 1st July to 15th Oct. 7–11 only).
No catalogue. Curator, M. E. Gouvet, the town architect.</p>

<p class='c016'>The chief treasures of the museum are the numerous mosaics from
Roman villas. In the centre of the hall is a large pavement from El-Alia,
already freely restored in ancient times, representing an inundation
of the Nile, with two-storied houses, a hippopotamus, a crocodile, etc.;
by the entrance-wall, Neptune in a chariot with sea-horses, ducks, and
fish; by the back-wall, procession of Bacchus, fishing scenes, a gazelle
among edible animals and fruits (from a dining-room), the rape of Ganymede,
a Nile scene, a basket with fish and lobsters; by the end-wall to
the left, a peacock. By the right end-wall, an early-Christian mosaic,
with the signature of the artist (Theodulos).</p>

<p class='c022'>By the back-wall are relics of wall-paintings and the marble statuette
of a negro boy. By the entrance-wall, fragments of Roman reliefs
in stucco: head of a bearded man, from El-Djem (2nd cent. A. D.); bust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>of Athena and female head in profile, from Susa (2nd cent.). By the
left end-wall, a large relief, from Susa, of the triumphal procession of
a Roman emperor, with a fettered warrior behind the chariot.</p>

<p class='c022'>The central presses contain (on the left) *Terracotta Figures from
Susa (mother and child, Venus, female harpist, rider on a camel, etc.)
and fine vessels in clay; (on the right) ancient coins; a fine bust in
bronze and leaden rolls inscribed with curses (comp. p. <a href='#Page_341'>341</a>), from Susa;
bronze utensils, trinkets, implements in bone; Punic, Roman, and early-Christian
lamps; mosaic of Virgil writing the Æneid.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old town, an irregular quadrilateral almost unspoiled by
modern improvements, contains no buildings of outstanding importance,
but its Oriental streets are strikingly picturesque. The
many-towered *<i>Town Wall</i>, with its gallery of defence and its
crowning battlements, was erected by the Aglabides (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) in 827.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Place Pichon we first visit the Place Bab el-Bahar
(Pl. C, 2), named after the old ‘sea-gate’, almost always enlivened
by a dense and busy throng. The main streets of this quarter
are the Rue de France and Rue Général-Logerot, between which
rises the <i>Chief Mosque</i> (Pl. C, 2), built in the Aglabide period on
a <b>⟙</b>-shaped plan (p. <a href='#Page_376'>376</a>), with forecourts like the Gâmia Ibn Tulûn
at Cairo (p. <a href='#Page_451'>451</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the secluded streets to the N.W. of the chief mosque, which
are best reached from the Hôtel de Ville (Pl. 3, B, C, 2; new building
in course of construction in the Ave. Mougeot, in front of the
harbour) by the Rue Général-Riu and Rue du Kasr, rises the so-called
<b>Kasr er-Ribât</b> (Pl. 5, C, 2; ‘castle-convent’), originally
a Byzantine fortress, but used since the Aglabide period as a fortified
monastery (Kasr al-Morabitîn, castle of the marabouts) for
defenders of the faith against the infidels. It is now a humble
medersa (p. <a href='#Page_228'>228</a>). The building, modernized in the Turkish period,
was originally square, with four round corner-towers and four at
the sides. The domed vestibule contains fragments of the Byzantine
edifice. In the interior (no admittance) there is a small mosque.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue Général-Sabatier on the W. side of the chief mosque,
and the Rue de Paris, its continuation to the S., lead to the Rue
el-Mar (Pl. B, 3, 4). Here, at the corner of the Rue de la Kasba
(p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), rises a fine <i>Minaret</i>. At the end of the street is an
interesting old <i>Dwelling House</i>, thoroughly restored in 1906, with
horseshoe and multifoil arches.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Rue de la Soffra (Pl. B, 3), above the Rue el-Mar, are
the <i>Roman Cisterns</i>, which have been repeatedly restored since
the middle ages (keys at the town architect’s; see p. <a href='#Page_367'>367</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. of the Rue de Paris are the picturesque <b>Souks</b>
(p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>). Immediately to the right, adjoining the Souk el-Rbâ
(Pl. B, 3), the vaulted lane in the middle, and at the entrance to
the Rue Bin el-Kaoui, is the <i>Kahwât el-Kubba</i> (Pl. 4, B, 3; ‘domed
café’), a small early-Moorish building with an interesting dome,
four wall-niches, and windows partly built up.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>The Souk el-Caïd, continuing the Souk el-Rbâ, ascends to the
<i>Bâb el-Gharbi</i> (Pl. A, 3), the old Moorish W. gate.—In the Rue
Dâr el-Bey, between the Souk el-Caïd and Rue de la Kasba, is the
<i>Dâr el-Bey</i> (Pl. 1; B, 3), an old palace of the beys of Tunis, now
the Contrôle Civil and office of the caïd (driba).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de la Kasba, or from Bâb el-Gharbi the boulevard
outside the town, leads to the <b>Kasba</b> (Pl. A, B, 4; 131 ft. above
the sea), the Moorish-Turkish citadel, built partly on the foundations
of a Roman temple, now the barracks of the tirailleurs (adm. on
presenting visiting-card; a sergeant acts as guide). The ‘Salle
d’Honneur’ contains neo-Punic and Roman antiquities from the Camp
Militaire (see below), including valuable mosaics (victorious racehorses,
etc.) and early-Christian objects from the catacombs
(see below). From the N. terrace of the Kasba, or from the tower
(now lighthouse; not always open), there is a splendid *View of
the town and harbour, of the Sahel, the whole bay of Hammamet,
and of the inland Tunisian hill-country as far as Jebel Zaghouan.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Bâb el-Gharbi a road leads to the W. to Kalaâ-Srira (p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>)
through the <i>Camp Militaire</i> (Pl. A, 3, 4), whose huts stand partly on the
ancient Punic burial-grounds. About ¾ M. from the gate are remains of a
<i>Roman Burial Ground</i>; also, on a road diverging to the left a little before,
extensive early-Christian <i>Catacombs</i> (adm. 1 fr.), 3 min. to the S. of the
highroad.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>From Susa to Mehdia</span>, 39½ M., railway in 3¼ hrs. (7 fr. 5, 5 fr. 35,
3 fr. 80 c.). The line runs, a little apart from the Sfax road (R. 59), at first
to the S.W., through the beautiful hill-country of the <i>Sahel</i>, to (6 M.)
<i>M’Saken</i> (p. <a href='#Page_378'>378</a>). 11 M. <i>Ouardenine</i>, where the new line to Sfax (see p. <a href='#Page_378'>378</a>)
diverges to the S. Our line sweeps round to the E. to (16 M.) <i>Djemmal</i>.—22 M.
<b>Moknine</b> (181 ft.; Café-Restaurant de la Gare; pop. 9000, incl.
700 Jews and 70 Europeans) is noted for its Jewish goldsmiths’ work in
an antique style like that of Djerba (p. <a href='#Page_394'>394</a>). On the road to Monastir
(p. <a href='#Page_405'>405</a>), 3¾ M. to the N.W. of Moknine, are the ruins of the very ancient
Phœnician-Roman seaport <i>Leptis Minor</i>, now <i>Lamta</i> or <i>Lempta</i> (remains
of the old quays, cisterns, etc.), near which is the Punic necropolis
<i>Henchir Meskhal</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>The train skirts the <i>Sebkha de Moknine</i>. 27½ M. <i>Teboulba</i> (146 ft.;
pop. 2900), a small town amidst pretty orange and mandarin gardens,
on the S. shore of the <i>Bay of Monastir</i> (p. <a href='#Page_405'>405</a>). Farther to the S.E. we
come to (30 M.) <i>Bekalta</i> (pop. 3400), a little town with the ruins of the
seaport of <i>Thapsus</i>, famed for Cæsar’s victory (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>; large Roman cisterns,
amphitheatre, quay of the Punic-Roman Kothon, Punic rock-tombs).</p>

<p class='c022'>39½ M. <b>Mehdia</b> or <i>Mahdia</i> (66 ft.; Hôt. de France, Grand-Hôtel,
both very humble; Brit. cons. agent, G. Violante; pop. 10,000, incl.
600 Europeans), the ancient capital of Ifrikia (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), founded in 916 as
<i>Mahedia</i> by the Fatimite Obeïd Allah el-Mahdi, on the site of the Phœnician-Roman
<i>Zella</i> (<i>Africa?</i>), is now a poor little seaport-town with hardly
a trace of its former renown. Being centrally situated on the E. coast
of Tunisia, on the narrow and once strongly fortified headland <i>Râs Mehdia</i>,
the <i>Cape Africa</i> of earlier writers, Mehdia, after the destruction of Kairwan
(p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), developed into the most prosperous town and important harbour of
Tunisia, but suffered severely from the transference of the seat of government
to Tunis (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>). In war also it was often sorely tried. It was conquered
by a Pisan fleet in 1087, occupied by the Normans in 1148–60, and
captured by the knights of Malta in 1530, by Kheireddin’s (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>) former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>general Dragut in 1540, and in 1550 by the Spaniards, who on their retreat
after the naval battle of Djerba (p. <a href='#Page_394'>394</a>) blew up its fortifications.</p>

<p class='c022'>The chief sights are the picturesque ruins of the <i>Town Walls</i> and
the <i>Grande Mosquée</i> of the 10th cent., formerly connected with a college,
with its many arcades and a fine gateway-tower, resembling the Bâb Lella
Rejana at Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_375'>375</a>). To the S.E. of the headland are remains
of the <i>Kothon</i>, the Punic-Roman harbour, which in the middle ages was
defended by two towers. The new harbour, the centre of the Sicilian
allache (kind of sardine) fishery, lies to the S.W. of the headland. Near
the town are large <i>Salt Marshes</i>. The <i>Necropolis</i>, 2 M. to the W., with
several well-preserved Punic and neo-Punic rock-tombs, deserves a visit.
About 1 M. from the town are extensive early-Christian <i>Catacombs</i>
(adm. 1 fr.).—Off Mehdia, in an ancient sunken ship, beautiful works of
art, now at the Bardo Museum (see p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>), have been recently discovered.</p>

<p class='c022'>A road (carr. 15 fr.) leads to the S.W. from Mehdia viâ (8 M.) <i>Ksour-Essaf</i>
to (26 M.) <i>El-Djem</i> (p. <a href='#Page_379'>379</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>In the olive-clad hill-country to the S. of Mehdia, on the road to Sfax
(p. <a href='#Page_380'>380</a>), lie the ruins of the ancient seaport of <i>Sullectum</i> (now <i>Salakta</i>),
of <i>Acholla</i> (p. <a href='#Page_398'>398</a>; now <i>Biar el-Alia</i>), both with Punic burial-grounds,
and of <i>Uzalis</i> (now <i>El-Alia</i>). Farther on, beyond the <i>Râs Kapoudia</i> (or
<i>Râs Khadidja</i>), the ancient <i>Caput Vada</i>, where Belisarius (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) landed
in 533, lies the small seaport of <b>Chebba</b>, noted like El-Alia for its Roman
mosaics. Near it are the ruins of <i>Ruspae</i> (now <i>Henchir Sbia</i>).</p>

<p class='c022'>From Susa to <i>Kairwan</i>, see R. 58; to the ruins of central Tunisia
and to <i>Metlaoui</i>, see R. 58; to <i>El-Djem</i> and <i>Sfax</i>, see R. 59.</p>

30 fr. 25, 22 fr. 95, 16 fr. 25 c.) change at Kalaâ-Srira (Rail. Restaurant).</p>

<p class='c009'>From Susa to (5 M.) <i>Kalaâ-Srira</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>. The line runs,
nearly in the same direction as the Susa and Tebessa (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>)
Roman road, to the S.W., on the right bank of the <i>Oued Laya</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>), to the (8 M.) <i>Réservoir</i> of the Susa waterworks.</p>

<p class='c011'>At (10 M.) <i>Oued-Laya</i>, a small oasis of fruit-trees and vegetables,
the olive-zone of the Sahel ends. 17½ M. <i>Kroussiah-Sahali</i>.
23 M. <i>Sidi el-Hani</i>, not far from the ruins of <i>Vicus Augusti</i> (<i>?</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the left, farther on, we obtain a glimpse at the <i>Sebkha Sidi
el-Hani</i>, 25 by 12½ M., the largest salt-lake of central Tunisia.
To the right, a little farther on, beyond a chain of flat hills, is revealed
a striking view of the vast <i>Plain of Kairwan</i>, enclosed by
distant mountains, with the town of <i>Kairwan</i> in the background.
The low ground, through which the <i>Oued Hathob</i> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>), <i>Oued
Merguellil</i>, and many smaller streams descend from the Sahara
Atlas and its plateaux to the <i>Lac de Kelbia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>; not visible
from the train), is often flooded after the winter rains. It is inhabited
almost exclusively by the Arab-like nomadic tribes of the
<i>Djlass</i> or <i>Zlass</i>. The train runs through plantations of Indian figs.</p>

<p class='c011'>30½ M. <i>Aïn-Ghrasesia.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>From Aïn-Ghrasesia to Metlaoui</span>, 182 M., railway in 13 hrs. (fares

<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>50 c.). This new railway, diverging here to the S.W., affords the easiest
access to the ruins of Sbeïtla, Kasserine, Thelepte, and Feriana in central
Tunisia. It runs over a low saddle between the Sebkha Sidi el-Hani (see
p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>) and the marshy plain of the <i>Oued Hathob</i>, and across the bleak
plain of Kairwan, to the S.W. borders of the Sahara Atlas, which it
reaches at the foot of <i>Jebel Touila</i>, with its zinc and lead mines.</p>

<p class='c022'>47½ M. <i>Hadjeb el-Aïoun</i>, the ancient <i>Masclianae</i>, on the <i>Oued
Zourzour</i>, is the chief market (Tues.) for the <i>Oulad Sendassen</i>, a branch
of the Djlass tribe (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>), and, like the following stations, possesses
an alfa-depot. Branch-line to <i>Sbiba</i>, the ancient <i>Sufes</i>, projected.</p>

<p class='c022'>Farther on we pass the foot of <i>Jebel Hadjeb el-Aïoun</i> to (58½ M.)
<i>Djilma</i> (1152 ft.), the Roman <i>Cilma</i>, on a tributary of the Hathob, here
called <i>Oued Djilma</i>, We now enter, to the W., the valley of the <i>Oued
Menasseur</i>, at the foot of <i>Jebel Mrilah</i> (4508 ft.) and <i>Jebel Sbeïtla</i>, inhabited
by the <i>Madjeur</i> tribe (p. <a href='#Page_362'>362</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>76 M. <b>Sbeïtla</b> (1762 ft.; hotel), near the extensive ruins of <i>Sufetula</i>,
on a plateau on the right bank of the <i>Oued Sbeïtla</i>, as the Oued Menasseur
is named here. It was a poor castellum in the time of Augustus,
but after the 2nd cent, became one of the most important junctions of
different routes, and in the 5–7th cent. attained its prime under the
Vandals and the Byzantines. In 645 it became the residence of Gregory,
the governor, who had rebelled against Byzantium; it was soon after
attacked by the Arabs under Abdallah ibn Saâd (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), and in 648 it
was entirely destroyed. The chief boast of Sbeïtla is the *<i>Capitol</i> (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_288'>288</a>), rising in the midst of the ruins. The temple-court, once used
by the Byzantines as a fortress and now destroyed save a few fragments
of the limestone pavement, was entered by a three-arched propylæum,
bearing an inscription in honour of Antoninus Pius (138–61). The chief
temple was pseudo-peripteral, with composite columns; there are still
traces of the steps up to it and of the portico. The three cellæ are well
preserved, especially at the back, and have a transverse wall, instead
of a semicircular apse, adjoining the Corinthian smaller temples. We
may note also a fine <i>Triumphal Arch</i> of the time of Constantine, the
remains of a <i>Byzantine Church</i> incorporated with a temple, to the N.
of the capitol, a <i>Chapel</i> built into a smaller temple, to the E., and the
<i>Aqueduct</i> across the Oued Sbeïtla. Higher up is the spring of the new
water-conduit, 103 M. long, which supplies the town of Sfax.</p>

<p class='c022'>Passing many other ruins we come to the <i>Plaine du Foussana</i> (about
2650 ft.), one of the upper districts of the Oued Hathob, here called <i>Foussana</i>,
at the S. foot of <i>Jebel Semmama</i> (4307 ft.; with the zinc-mines of
<i>Aïn-Khamouda</i> on its N. side). Then a descent to (95 M.) <b>Kasserine</b>
(2382 ft.), the ancient <i>Cillium</i>, a flourishing town from the 2nd cent. A.D.
under the name of <i>Colonia Cillitana</i>, now a poor village with a caravanserai
on the Thala and Feriana road (see p. <a href='#Page_362'>362</a> and below), not far
from the chalky limestone masses of <i>Jebel Chambi</i> (5217 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>). We
may here visit the ruins of the Roman <i>Arch</i> and of the <i>Tomb of the
Petronii</i>, and above all the interesting <i>Mausoleum of T. Flavius Secundus</i>,
of the time of Trajan. This is a kind of tower in three stories, in the
Phœnician fashion, terminating in a pyramid; the 110 bombastic lines
of the inscription correspond with the number of years attained by the
deceased. A little to the S., on the <i>Oued Derb</i>, are remains of a Roman
<i>Barrage</i>,—The landscape farther on, where Roman ruins still abound,
assumes more and more the Sahara character.</p>

<p class='c022'>116 M. <b>Thelepte</b> (hotel) is the station for the ruins of the ancient
town of that name, now called <i>Medinet el-Khedima</i> (‘the old town’),
which in the 2nd–4th cent. A.D. was the chief place on the road between
Tebessa (p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>) and Gafsa (p. <a href='#Page_383'>383</a>). Large thermæ, ruins of early-Christian
basilicas, and a Byzantine fortress with many towers are to be seen here.
The extensive Roman <i>Quarries</i> are interesting.</p>

<p class='c022'>118½ M. <b>Feriana</b> (2628 ft.; Hôt. Hostelier; Restaurant Bernard; pop.
1200), an oasis of corn, fruit, and vegetables on the <i>Oued Feriana</i>, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>the midst of a sandy plain, has a new and pretty mosque.—Thence we
cross the <i>Plateau de Msila</i> (2930 ft.), overgrown with alfa, and descend
to (134 M.) <i>Maâjen Bel-Abbès</i>, with the ruins of a Roman town, 28 M.
to the N.W. of Gafsa. 141 M. <i>Sidi Bou-Beker</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>153½ M. <i>Henchir Souatir</i> (about 1640 ft.). A short branch-line
diverges hence to <i>Aïn-Moularès</i> (1806 ft.), a caravanserai near the great
beds of phosphate on the Algerian frontier.</p>

<p class='c022'>166 M. <i>Tabeditt</i> is connected by railway with (9½ M.) <i>Redeyef</i>, which
has rich phosphate deposits.—Beyond Tabeditt the train runs through
the valley of the <i>Oued Seldja</i> (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>), here inhabited by the <i>Oulad Sidi-Abid</i>
nomads, to (183 M.) <i>Metlaoui</i> (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Kairwan Line</span> runs to the W. over the bleak steppe, often
passing the tents and the browsing camels and cattle of the Djlass
(p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>). We cross the Oued Hathob, here called <i>Zeroud</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the right, especially in the afternoon, we have a delightful
*View of the white houses of Kairwan, with its countless domes
and towering minarets. Nearing the station we see extensive fields
of cactus and large alfa-stacks.</p>

<p class='c016'>36 M. <b>Kairwan.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotels</span> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_324'>324</a>). <i>Splendid Hotel</i>

<p class='c022'>In <span class='sc'>Half-a-Day</span>, if pressed for time, we may visit the <i>Grande Rue</i>,
the <i>Souks</i>, the <i>Sidi Okba Mosque</i>, and the <i>Mosquée du Barbier</i>. Tickets
for the mosques are obtained at the office of the Contrôle Civil (p. <a href='#Page_373'>373</a>)
or at the hotels. The overseers of the mosques mostly speak Arabic only.
The guides, who are quite unnecessary, are very importunate.</p>

<p class='c022'>Travellers in haste should endeavour to secure a cab (as yet only
one), drive to the Contrôle Civil, the Barber’s Mosque, and back to the
Porte de Tunis (p. <a href='#Page_377'>377</a>), and there begin their inspection of the town.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Kairwan</i> or <i>Kairouan</i> (243 ft.; pop. 22,000, incl. about
800 Europeans), the oldest capital of Ifrikia, is a town of purely
Arabian type, the most curious in Tunisia. The old town is
an irregular rectangle, enclosed by a wall 33 ft. high and 2 M. in
length; the large W. suburb, also purely Oriental, is the <i>Faubourg
des Djlass</i>, called after the nomadic tribe of that name (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>);
to the S. is a new suburb near the station. The numerous mosques
and zaouïas date mostly from the Turkish period. The town holds
market for the extensive plain of Kairwan, and the souks are still
important, though manufactures have declined. The climate (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>)
is extremely hot in summer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Kairwan was founded by Sidi Okba ben-Nâfi (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) in 671, and
was appointed by the caliphs to be the seat of the governors of Ifrikia.
As the capital of the great Aglabide empire (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) and the seat of the
oldest high school in N. Africa, it was hardly less important than Cordova
(p. <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>), and the sumptuous mosque of Sidi Okba rapidly became
the favourite goal of pilgrims from E. Barbary. After the Hilalides
(p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>) had destroyed the greater part of the town in 1048 it was for
centuries almost deserted, notwithstanding the favour shown to it by
Abd el-Mûmen (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>), the Hafsides, and the Merinides (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>). In the
early 16th cent. several quarters still lay in ruins. It was not till the
Turkish period that the sacred town, ‘one of the four gates of Paradise’,
which neither Christian nor Jew durst enter, again became the religious
centre of the land. To spend one’s last days within its walls, and to be
buried in hallowed earth outside its gates, seemed to believers the height
of bliss. Its sacred character, which however did not prevent the beys
of Tunis from bombarding and partly destroying the rebellious town, was
finally lost when the mosques were desecrated by the entry of the French
troops in 1881.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>In the centre of the S. suburb, almost exclusively inhabited by
Europeans, is the <span class='sc'>Place Carnot</span> (Pl. C, 5), with its small <i>Jardin
Public</i>. On its W. side the Rue du Contrôle, with the building of
the <i>Contrôle Civil</i> (Pl. C, 5; see p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), leads to the N. to the Place
Mérabet (Pl. C, 4) and the S. gate of the town-walls, which were
largely rebuilt after the bombardment of 1740.</p>

<p class='c011'>On emerging from the Rue du Contrôle we see immediately to
the left the <i>Zaouïa Sidi ben-Aïssa</i> (Pl. C, 5), where the hideous
castigations of the Aïssaoua sect, originally Moroccan, are held on
Friday afternoons. A little to the N.E., in the Rue de la Poste,
is the <i>M’sala Darb et-Tamar</i> (Pl. D, 4; no admittance), a large
open place of prayer for great Mohammedan festivals, with an
underground cistern for rain-water.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main street of the old town, between the <i>Bâb Djelladin</i>
(Pl. C, 4; ‘Porte des Peaussiers’), or S. gate, now partly demolished,
and the N. gate, the Porte de Tunis (p. <a href='#Page_377'>377</a>), is the <span class='sc'>Grande Rue</span>
(Pl. C, B, 4, 3), officially called Rue du Général-Saussier, enlivened
by a picturesque crowd and numerous small shops.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the Rue Sidi el-Guerian, the second side-street on the right, is the
zaouïa of <b>Sidi Abid el-Guerian</b> (Pl. C, 4), an elegant building of the
Turkish period (16th cent.?). The handsome portal, with the black and
white striped decoration so often recurring in the other buildings, leads
into a vestibule with tiled walls and stucco decoration, beyond which are
a fine colonnaded court in two stories (with the sumptuous tomb of the
saint on the left) and a small mosque. Adjacent on the left is the court
of the Medersa (p. <a href='#Page_228'>228</a>), where the capitals of the columns are remarkable
for their richness and variety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Farther on in the Grande Rue are several mosques of little
architectural interest. The gateway on the right, halfway between
the two town-gates, leads to the <b>Souks</b> (Pl. C, 3, 4). The vaulted
main street here, the <i>Souk des Selliers</i> and <i>Souk des Cordonniers</i>,
is intersected by two vaulted side-streets, the <i>Souk des Parfums</i>
and <i>Souk des Tapis</i>. The latter, for the sale of carpets, woollen rugs
(margums), etc., has declined since the vegetable dyes have been
superseded by the aniline. The farther part of the main street is the
<i>Souk des Gandourahs</i>, ending at the quiet Place Finot (Pl. C, 3).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S.E. from the Place Finot the short Rue Moulei-Taïeb
leads to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Djamâa Tleta Biban</b> (Pl. C, D, 3; Mosquée des Trois-Portes),
in the Rue Hassin Lalenni. It dates from the time of Obeïd Allah
el-Mahdi (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), being the only early-Moorish building in Kairwan
besides the Sidi Okba mosque, but was much altered in 1440
and 1509. The peculiar façade in three sections, with blind arcades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>(possessing Byzantine capitals) on the lower story, is composed
above of older slabs with geometrical ornamentation. The interior
is uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c011'>We follow the Rue de la Mosquée des Trois-Portes to the N.E.,
then the Rue Zoughar to the right, and at the end of it a street
to the left to the town-wall. To the left, in 2 min. more, we reach
the Place de Sousse, with the <i>Bâb el-Khoukha</i> (Pl. D, 2, 3), the
E. town-gate, an interesting double gateway, with two fine Byzantine
capitals on the inner archway. From the N. end of the Place
de Sousse the broad Rue de la Grande-Mosquée leads to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Sidi Okba Mosque</b> (<i>Grande Mosquée</i>; Pl. D, 1, 2), one of
the oldest in the world, and, next to the Kairwin mosque at Fez,
the most important in Barbary. After the mosques of Mecca and
Medina and the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem (p. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>), this has
ever been deemed the greatest sanctuary of Islam. The poverty
of the oldest building, founded by Sidi Okba ben-Nâfi in 671, is
evidenced by the mud-built walls of the old mihrâb (p. <a href='#Page_377'>377</a>). A
new building was first erected in 703 by Hassan ibn en-Nôman
(p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), the conqueror of Carthage. The plan seems to have been
suggested by that of the oldest Egyptian mosques (such as the
mosque of Amru, p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>), combined with that of the Damous el-Karita
(p. <a href='#Page_349'>349</a>), while the ruins of Carthage, Susa, and Sbeïtla
(p. <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>) supplied the building-materials. Of a second new building
by the governor Bichr ibn Safuan, in 724, the fortress-like lower
story of the minaret still exists. A further extension was made in
821 by the Aglabide Sijadet Allah I. The central story of the minaret,
the arcades of the quadrangle, the Bâb el-Behou (p. <a href='#Page_376'>376</a>),
and the last enlargement of the sanctuary itself are due to the
Aglabide Ibrahim ibn-Ahmed (d. 875), who erected also the fine
dome of the mihrâb, caused the mihrâb-wall to be decorated
by Bagdad artists, and presented the superb Friday pulpit. The
present maksûra (seat of the caliph) dates from the time of the
Zirite Abû Teminn el-Muizz (p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>). The decay of the mosque
after the irruption of the Hilalides seems to have been first arrested
by Abd el-Mûmen and the Hafside El-Mostanser Billah (p. <a href='#Page_332'>332</a>).
The latter, in 1284, caused most of the outer gateways to be rebuilt.
At a later period we hear of restorations by Mohammed Murad Bey
(p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>) and Hussein Ali ben-Turki (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>). In 1828–42 the insecure
state of the mosque necessitated the rebuilding of the external
walls on the N.W. and N.E. sides and the restoration of the minaret,
the Bâb el-Behou, and the arcades of the court. In 1872 the nave
and its two adjoining aisles also were restored, but with little taste,
and since 1895 the French government has bestowed its attention
on the transept and the side-portals.</p>

<p class='c011'>The immense edifice, an irregular quadrilateral of 136 by about
78–82 yds., covers an area of over 2¼ acres. The fortress-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span><span class='sc'>Outer Wall</span>, with its huge buttresses, has four doors on both its
longer sides. These have lost their bronze mountings and some
of them their cupolas. Above the S.E. wall rises the dome of the
mihrâb chapel and above the N.W. wall the minaret.</p>

<p class='c011'>We first walk round the whole enclosure. From the Rue de la
Grande-Mosquée a short street leads to the right, past the new
<i>Court of Ablution</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>), to a large open space adjoining the
S.E. end of the mosque, where there are numerous underground silos
or granaries. From the walls here project the buildings of the
mihrâb chapel and the maksûra, with the Bâb el-Imâm (p. <a href='#Page_377'>377</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces farther, at the beginning of the ‘Boulevard Ali
Bey’, a poor street on the N.E. side of the precincts, is the massive
square gateway tower of *<i>Bâb Lella Rejana</i>, adjoined by the insignificant
domed tomb of that saint. The front half of the gateway,
restored in 1828, is painted like the minaret with ‘giant-spiders’
to ward off snakes and scorpions, and is adorned below
the battlements with blind horseshoe arcades. The perforated stucco
decoration of the arch-recesses of the side-portals is one of the
earliest examples of such work. The long inscription over the door
extols caliph El-Mostanser-Billah (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>), the builder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the next three gates we come to the N. angle of the
precincts, where their fortress-like character is most apparent.
Beside the embrasures of the minaret (p. <a href='#Page_376'>376</a>) are seen cannon-ball
marks made during the bombardments of the 18th century.</p>

<p class='c011'>The S.W. wall of the mosque, in the Rue de la Grande-Mosquée,
which we now regain, is most in conformity with the original plan.
Most noteworthy here are the first gateway-tower, near the N.W.
angle, and the <i>Bâb es-Sultân</i>, the last gate, through which led
the shortest way from the caliph’s palace to the maksûra (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_377'>377</a>). The domes, now adorned with the Turkish crescent, still
possess their girdle of battlements and have their old cornice of
bricks placed crosswise.</p>

<p class='c011'>The present <span class='sc'>Entrance Gateway</span> (visitors knock) is one of the
small middle gates beside the Bâb es-Sultân. We descend a few
steps to the court (now below the level of the street), where the
irregular plan of the building is most distinctly seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Court</span> is bordered on the N.W. side by a single colonnade
and on the other sides by double arcades, which on the S.E. side
form the porch of the sanctuary. In contrast to the orange-court
at Cordova (p. <a href='#Page_70'>70</a>), it is much larger than the sanctuary itself.
The marble pavement is modern. The perforated stone in the
centre of the court conducts the rain-water from the gutters on
the flat roofs into a filtering-apparatus and into three <i>Cisterns</i>
below. The old <i>Court of Ablution</i> (Ancienne Mida; comp. above),
near the W. angle, and the rooms adjoining the minaret are now
used as lumber-rooms.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>The <i>Minaret</i>, 128 ft. high, an extremely massive tower in three
stories, rises in the centre of the N.W. wall, and not in the central
axis of the building as is usual. The substructures have been built
of Roman stones and the doorway framed with antique decorative
slabs. The square lowest story and narrower middle story are
crowned with peculiar battlements with small embrasures. Above
the three metal balls (p. <a href='#Page_195'>195</a>) of the present dome is perched the
Turkish crescent.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<span class='sc'>Ascent of the Minaret</span> (127 easy steps) should not be omitted.
On the lower platform we note the muezzin’s hut (p. <a href='#Page_180'>180</a>). The upper
platform commands a superb survey of the many-domed town, of the
Barber’s Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_378'>378</a>), of the large cemeteries to the W., and of the
great plain of Kairwan, bounded by Jebel Trozza and other distant hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the centre of the porch of the sanctuary is the square <i>Bâb
el-Behou</i> (‘pavilion-gate’) with a great horseshoe archway and pinnacled
summit. The drum and dome, formerly resembling the dome
of the mihrâb, were rebuilt in 1828. The timber ceiling of the
adjoining arcades is now partly replaced by brick-vaulting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Main Door</i> of the sanctuary, in cedar-wood, also was
renewed in 1828 by wood-carvers from Sfax (p. <a href='#Page_380'>380</a>). The wings
are beautifully enriched with network, rosettes, and arabesques
(p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>). Over the door are a frieze with an inscription and another
adorned with mashrebîyeh or lattice-work, and above these is a
pediment decorated with charming scroll-work. The side-doors,
also in cedar-wood, and partly modern, have a simpler geometric
ornamentation, resembling that of the maksûra screen (p. <a href='#Page_377'>377</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<span class='sc'>Interior</span> of the sanctuary, in the form of a so-called Egyptian
cross (<b>⟙</b>), with a broad transept at the back, has a nave and
sixteen aisles, with eight rows of arcades. In the axis of the Bâb el-Behou,
above the intersection of the nave and transept, rises the
dome of the mihrâb-chapel, in front of the mihrâb-recess. The timber
ceilings of the aisles, dating from different centuries, still retain
interesting traces of their old painting. The effect of the nave is
marred by the new braces and the clumsy modern stucco-decoration
of the upper walls. The candelabra are ancient, but of little artistic
value. The old pavement has disappeared and so too have the
tapestries once used for festivals. The somewhat colourless aspect
of the interior is compensated by the beauty of the columns, which
here, as well as in the court, merit careful study. The shafts, as at
Cordova, are of surprisingly various materials: white and coloured
marble, onyx, granite, porphyry, and variegated breccia. Besides
the few Moorish capitals in the more modern parts of the mosque,
we note Roman, early-Christian, Byzantine, and even Punic-Ionic
forms. Owing to their unequal lengths some of the columns have
been raised while others are partly buried in the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Mihrâb Chapel</i>, unfortunately thickly whitewashed, is
specially noteworthy for its sumptuous decoration and the peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>construction of its dome. The chief enrichment of the wall consists
of *Fayence with gold lustre, the oldest mediæval relic of this art-industry,
the origin of which seems to be indicated by the name of
‘tchini’ (China tiles) given to it by native writers. The two beautiful
Byzantine columns which bear the archivolts of the mihrâb are said
to have come from Carthage. Through the marble screen of the
niche, now disfigured by painting, we obtain a glimpse at the ancient
mihrâb of the time of Sidi Okba (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<i>Mimbar</i>, or Friday pulpit, unfortunately very tastelessly
restored in 1907, adjoining the mihrâb-recess on the right,
is one of the earliest and most beautiful creations of early-Moorish
art. On the model of the Byzantine ivory carving, its rectangular
sections are most charmingly enriched with a great variety of scroll-work
and arabesques. The material is sycamore-wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>The present *<i>Maksûra</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>), to the right of the pulpit,
seems to be now enclosed with fragments of an older screen of the
caliph’s maksûra and parts of the wooden screen of a former maksûra
for the ladies of the court (to the left of the pulpit). The
central sections, destroyed in part, with their plain geometric decoration,
are framed with graceful arabesques. The long Cufic inscription
under the pinnacles of the summit records the name of
the founder (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>) amidst verses from the Koran.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the back of the Maksûra is a *Door, framed with late-Roman
marble ornamentation and tastefully embellished with iron nails and two
knockers, leading into a corridor. The side-room on the left, with
another fine old door, contains a few relics of the once famous Kairwan
<i>Library</i>. The small door in the external wall is the <i>Bâb el-Imâm</i> (‘gate
of the preacher’).</p>

<p class='c009'>We now return by the Rue el-Kadraouine (Pl. D, C, 2, 3) to
Place Finot (p. <a href='#Page_373'>373</a>) and the Souks; or we follow the town-wall,
through the Rue Sidi Abd el-Kader (Pl. D, C, 2) and past the zaouïa
<i>Sidi Abd el-Kâder el-Djilâni</i> (p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>) and the <i>Kasba</i> (Pl. B, C, 2;
barracks), and so regain the Grande Rue.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N. end of the Grande Rue is the new <i>Porte de Tunis</i>
(Pl. B, 3; adjoining the fine old gateway, adorned with antique
columns), leading into the <span class='sc'>Place de Tunis</span>, the outer market-place,
a haunt of reciters and jugglers, with a large <i>Fondouk</i> (see
p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Place de Tunis we may now walk to the N., past the
pretty park of the <i>Pépinière</i> (Pl. B, 1), to the (10 min.) <i>Bassins
des Aglabides</i>, two round reservoirs, the smaller of which was once
used for filtering purposes. Both have been utilized since 1885 for
the conduit of Cherichera, 18¾ M. long.</p>

<p class='c011'>A road, much used by caravans, leads from the Place de Tunis,
past the dilapidated <i>Feskia du Saïd</i> (Pl. A, 2; a rain-water basin),
of the time of Sijadet Allah I., and between cactus-hedges, to the
N.W. to (¼ hr.) the so-called—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>*<b>Mosquée du Barbier</b> (beyond Pl. A, 2), the finest building
of the Turkish period. This mosque, which has long been regarded
as the second great sanctuary of Kairwan, lies most picturesquely
among low hills and is surrounded with white tombs of saints and
Moslem cemeteries. It is dedicated to Abû Zemaâ el-Beloui, the
traditional friend (sahâb) and barber of the prophet.</p>

<p class='c016'>The extensive group of buildings, with several medersas annexed,
dates chiefly from the 17–19th centuries. The outer gate leads into a low
forecourt. In the corner, between the two main entrances, rises the
handsome minaret (*View), in four stories, with blind arcades in the two
lower, and crowned with pinnacles and the muezzin’s turret. The large
W. portal, adorned like the minaret with Byzantine columns, opens into
the first inner court, on whose W. side rises the plain mosque itself with
its nave and two aisles. A remarkably beautiful domed chamber leads
into the second *Inner Court, a perfect gem, with its slender little marble
columns, old wall-tiles, rich stucco-decoration, and modern soffited ceilings.
A superb marble portal of Italian workmanship (18th cent.) leads to the
alleged tomb of Sidi Sahâb, which is railed in and surrounded with
valuable old Kairwan carpets besides much European frippery. From
the domed chamber a *Colonnade to the left and another ante-room, also
embellished with fine mural tiles, lead us back to the outer court.</p>

<p class='c009'>The large <i>Moslem Cemeteries</i>, which extend round the <i>Faubourg
des Djlass</i> (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>) from the Barber’s Mosque all the way to
the S. suburb, still contain some very old tombstones. They afford
a beautiful view of Kairwan, especially by evening light.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <b>Djamâa Amor Abeda</b> (Pl. A, 3, 4; popularly called Mosquée
des Sabres), whose five huge domes of mediæval type dominate the poor
streets of the Faubourg des Djlass, was built by the saint of that name
(d. 1871), formerly a smith, with alms collected for the purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>59. From Susa to Sfax.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Till the opening of the new railway (81½ M.) in 1911, which diverges
from the line to Mehdia at Ouardenine (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), this excursion must be
made by <span class='sc'>Road</span> (79½ M.). Motor-omnibus or the Bône-Guélma Co., starting
from the station, in 6½ hrs. (in the reverse direction 7 hrs.), fare 7 fr. 50 c.;
at El-Djem, halfway (fare 3 fr. 75 c.), the ½ hr. allowed for visiting the
amphitheatre barely suffices. Seats should be secured beforehand; outside
(impériale) preferable in fine weather. Diligence at night, in 14 hrs., fare
12 fr. 90 c. (to El-Djem in 6½ hrs., 6 fr.), uncomfortable.—<span class='sc'>Steamers</span> to
Sfax, comp. R. 64.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Susa</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>. The road leads round the town on the side
next the sea. It then ascends through the new industrial and villa
quarters, and past the <i>Jewish</i> and the <i>Christian Cemeteries</i> (on the
left), to the hill-country of the <i>Sahel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the left lie the thriving villages of <i>Zaouïet-Sousse</i> and
<i>Ksiba</i>, and to the right <i>Messadine</i>. The soil is extremely fertile;
the road is bordered with huge olive-trees and tall cactus-hedges.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the right, also off the road, lies (7½ M.) <b>M’Saken</b> (154 ft.;
Hôt. de France; pop. 10,000), a station on the Mehdia line (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>),
whence a road leads to Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>The country beyond M’Saken, one of the most fertile parts of
central Tunisia in ancient times, has become a mere desert since
the Arab irruptions. In the midst of the dreary steppe, scantily
overgrown with alfa, appear a few corn-fields and olive-plantations,
the first signs of renewed colonization. Here and there are
seen Arabs with their camels, belonging to the <i>Souassi</i> tribe, now
partly settled on the land, descendants of the Hilalides (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the distance to the right, beyond <i>Bourdjine</i>, the only village
before El-Djem, appears the <i>Sebkha Sidi el-Hani</i> (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>). 23 M.
<i>Col de Koudiat el-Goulal</i> (525 ft.), the highest point on the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are now in sight of the amphitheatre of <i>El-Djem</i>, whose
enormous pile dominates the landscape for miles around.</p>

<p class='c011'>40 M. <b>El-Djem</b> (361 ft.; Hôt. de l’Amphithéâtre, R. 2–3, B. ¾,
déj. 3, D. 3¼ fr., humble, charges should be ascertained), a poor
Arab village with a few olive and cactus plantations, is the site
of <i>Thysdrus</i>, which in the late-Roman age was one of the most
thriving towns near the E. coast and the junction of seven roads.</p>

<p class='c011'>About ¼ M. from the inn and the post-office (halting-place of
the motor-omnibus) is the **<i>Amphitheatre</i>, the grandest Roman
structure in Barbary (first half of the 3rd cent.), noted in history
also as a fortress. Here in 689, after the defeat of the united
Byzantines and Berbers by Zoheir ibn Kaïs (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), the prophetess
(kahina) Damia, the legendary leader of the Berbers, is said to have
still defied her enemies. In 1685 the building, still almost intact,
where many a rebel had sought refuge, was blown up on the W.
side by order of Mohammed Murad Bey (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>). Since then it has
served the villagers of El-Djem as a quarry. The topmost story,
consisting of an attica with Corinthian pilasters, the tiers of seats,
and the stone steps have gradually disappeared. The ascent (not
without the Arab keeper; ½ fr.) is very toilsome.</p>

<p class='c011'>The remaining three stories are 108 ft. high; the groundfloor
is now buried 10 ft. below the surface. The arches (once 60) of the
lower and upper stories are adorned with Corinthian mural columns;
the central story has composite capitals. The axes are 164 and
136 yds. respectively; the arena where the gladiators and wild beasts
fought, unearthed in 1909, with its huge substructures (comp. p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>),

<p class='c009'><i>Sfax</i>, Arabic <i>Sfakês</i> (pop. 70,000, incl. 6400 Europeans, of
whom 3100 are Italians and 1300 Maltese), the second-largest town
in Tunisia, is also its chief seaport next to Tunis. It lies on the
shallow N. shore of the <i>Gulf of Gabes</i>, adjacent to the <i>Kerkenna
Banks</i> and opposite the <i>Kerkenna Islands</i> (p. <a href='#Page_405'>405</a>). Many of the
natives live in small houses outside the town, amidst the beautiful
orchards which girdle Sfax for nearly 10 M. around. Beyond the
gardens lies the olive-zone, like them artificially irrigated, covering
some 500 acres, and numbering three million trees. It lies chiefly
in the <i>Terres Sialines</i>, a region named after the Siala family, but
now owned by the state. After the Arab incursions it became a
mere desert, but modern cultivation has restored its ancient prosperity.
Sfax owes its rapid rise to the export of olive-oil, almonds,
figs, and vegetables from the interior, dates from the Djerid (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>),
alfa from the steppes, of which cables are made in the Kerkenna
Islands, and above all to its trade in the phosphates of Metlaoui
(p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>) and Redeyef (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>). It is important also as a fish-market
and as a mart for the sponges of the bay, especially from the Kerkenna
banks. In the sponge-fishery Greeks, Maltese, and Sicilians
vie with the Kerkenna islanders.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Sfax, the ancient <i>Taparura</i>, which was one of the smallest seaports
on the bay of Gabes, is of little historical note. In the first half of the
12th cent. it fell, along with Mehdia (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), into the hands of the Normans
(p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), and in 1539 it was occupied for a time by the Spaniards,
who possessed also the Kerkenna Islands. Its harbour was much benefited
by the French occupation of Algeria, as the caravans from the
Sudan thereafter went to Sfax, Gabes, and Tripoli (p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>). It was not
till 1832 that Christian merchants were allowed to settle outside the Bâb
Diwân, the sea-gate. When the French arrived in 1881 Sfax, like Kairwan,
was a camp of the warlike nomads of central and S. Tunisia, owing to
whose resistance the town had to suffer a bombardment and to pay a war-indemnity
of 15 million francs. For that disaster and for the decline of
its trade with inland Africa the colonization of the environs and the
improvement of the harbour (1895–7) have since made amends.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the open roads at the end of the Kerkenna inlet, where
larger vessels formerly had to anchor, a <i>Harbour Canal</i>, 2952 yds.
in length and 44 in breadth, now leads into the <b>Bassin</b> (Pl. D, E,
4) of 25 acres, adjoining which is the <i>Bassin des Torpilleurs</i>
(Pl. C, D, 4). On the quay bordering the town, 492 yds. long, are
the <i>Douane</i> and two large warehouses. On the N.E. quay are the
stores of the phosphate railway, whence ships are loaded by means
of a long shoot. The <i>Chenal pour petits Bateaux</i> connects the
main harbour with the small <i>Darse</i> (Pl. B, 4), the harbour for
fishing-boats.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mud-banks between the new harbour and the old quay (now
Boul. de France) have been artificially raised and converted into
an area of 50 acres for building. The projected new quarter, with
its straight and shadeless streets, has made little progress as yet.
Between it and the older suburb, built since 1832, are the Avenue
de Paris and the palm-avenue of the <span class='sc'>Boulevard de France</span> (Pl. B,
C, 3), where most of the public buildings are situated.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Ave. de Paris are the Contrôle Civil (Pl. 1; C, 3), the
Post Office (Pl. 6; C, 3), and the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> (Pl. C, 3). The last
has a small museum (open daily except Sun.) containing Roman
antiquities, mostly from Thænæ (p. <a href='#Page_383'>383</a>). Among the mosaics are
fishing scenes, Arion on the dolphin, and Pugilists.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the E. end of the Boul. de France and the Place Carnot
(Pl. C, 2) lies the <i>Jewish Quarter</i>. The Boul. de France leads to
the W., past the Rue de la République, the chief business street of
the new quarters, to the <i>Marché aux Céréales</i> (Pl. B, 3), which
may be reached also by the Rue Victor-Hugo. Near this, adjoining
the harbour of the fishing-boats, is the <i>Marché</i> (Pl. B, 3, 4) for
pottery, where the large ‘jarres d’huile’, made chiefly by the
Metellits (p. <a href='#Page_380'>380</a>), resemble the ancient amphoræ.</p>

<p class='c011'>The picturesque but not over-clean old town is still enclosed
by its battlemented *<b>Town Walls</b>, with their numerous towers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>and bastions. The fortifications next the sea, the <i>Kasba</i> (Pl. A, 3;
barracks, no admittance) and the <i>Bordj en-Nar</i> (Pl. C, 2), were
the chief objects of attack by the French ships and troops in 1881.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old town is entered by the <i>Bâb Djedid</i> (Pl. A, 3), the <i>Bâb
Diwân</i> (Pl. B, 2), at the end of the Rue de la République, and the
new <i>Porte Delcassé</i> (Pl. B, 2; 1903). Its main streets are the Rue
de la Grande-Mosquée, the shortest way to the Souks (see below),
and the <span class='sc'>Rue du Bey</span> (Pl. B, 2, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Rue des Aïssaouas (No. 12), a few paces to the right of
the Rue du Bey, is the <i>Zaouïa Sidi ben-Aïssa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_373'>373</a>), with its
fine portal. The castigations practised by the sect may be seen
here on Fridays, from 2.30 to 5 p.m.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Rue de la Driba, the third street to the right off the Rue
du Bey, No. 4, on the left, is the <i>Driba</i> (Pl. 2; B, 2), a fine type
of an aristocratic mansion, with a picturesque colonnaded court on
the first floor (fee ½ fr.). Opposite, at No. 5 Rue Régulus, one of
the <i>Portals</i> has the geometric ornamentation so common in every
part of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the <span class='sc'>Rue de la Grande-Mosquée</span> rises the venerable
<i>Chief Mosque</i> (Pl. B, 2), with its square whitewashed minaret,
whose upper half is of the 13th century. The main façade recalls
Syrian types (Kalat Simân), and the ten arcades of the interior are
like those of the Sidi Okba mosque (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Just beyond the mosque are the <b>Souks</b>, or markets. Their
centre is the vaulted <i>Souk des Etoffes</i> (Pl. B, 2), with a large
assortment of ‘gadrouns’, the chief garment of the people of Sfax,
blankets from Gafsa, etc. Its continuation, the Rue des Teinturiers,
leads to the <i>Bâb Djebli</i> (Pl. A, 1), the picturesque N.W. gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the right the town-wall is skirted by the Rue des Forgerons
(Pl. B, 1), with its balconies. To the left, Rue Abd el-Kader 62, is
the law-court of the <i>Ouzara</i> (Pl. A, 1; sits Wednesday and Saturday
forenoons), with a pretty court.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside Bâb Djebli is the bustling cattle-market, enclosed by
fondouks or caravanserais, where we have a pretty view of several
saints’ tombs and palm-shaded gardens.</p>

<p class='c016'>A pleasant glimpse of the country and its inhabitants is afforded by
a drive to the Toual el-Chridi (tariff, see p. <a href='#Page_380'>380</a>; but bargain advisable).
Beyond the Bâb Djebli we pass the large <i>Feskias</i>, or rain-water reservoirs,
and then numerous <i>Nasrias</i> or small cisterns. The *Orchard Zone
extends about 5 M. inland. Passing through olive-groves and flanked
with straight rows of trees the road ascends to the (13½ M.) <b>Toual el-Chridi</b>
(433 ft.), a hill with a geometric signal, a kind of pyramid in
steps, where we have an extensive view stretching to the sea.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the road to Gabes (p. <a href='#Page_389'>389</a>), beyond the S.W. suburb of <i>Picville</i>
and the Rond-Point, is the <i>Jardin Public</i>, watered by large basins, with
the Jardin d’Essai, or botanic garden.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the sea, nearly 1 M. outside the harbour, is a <i>Biological Station</i>
for the promotion of the sponge-culture (comp. p. <a href='#Page_381'>381</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span><i>Gafsa</i> (1067 ft.; pop. 4500, incl. about 1000 Jews and 360 Europeans),
the ancient <i>Capsa</i>, is a peaceful little oasis-town, with two
hot springs (88–91½° Fahr.) and several cold, rising in or near the
river-bed. The old town lies on the edge of the plateau, on the right
bank of the Oued Baïech, which almost everywhere else is dry. It has
formed a valley about 3 M. broad, between <i>Jebel Orbata</i> (3839 ft.;
p. <a href='#Page_385'>385</a>), on the E., and the spurs of <i>Jebel Bou-Ramli</i> (3609 ft.)
on the N.W., this being the only considerable pass between the
S. Tunisian steppe and the shotts (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>). The town is sheltered
by <i>Jebel Ben-Younès</i> (3002 ft.) and <i>Jebel Assalah</i> from the cold
N.W. and N. winds, and like El-Kantara (p. <a href='#Page_276'>276</a>) is a portal of the
desert. Its mild climate and beautiful oasis render it a fine winter
residence for persons of moderate requirements.</p>

<p class='c016'>Capsa is said to be one of the oldest towns in the interior of Tunisia.
Owing to its remote situation in the extreme southern part of his dominions
Jugurtha (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>) made it one of his headquarters and his treasury; but
one morning at dawn, after a nine days’ march from Lares (p. <a href='#Page_360'>360</a>), so
graphically described by Sallust, it was surprised by Marius and razed to
the ground in 106. Under Augustus the town was still in ruins, yet in the
2nd cent. it vied with Thelepte (Feriana, p. <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>) as one of the wealthiest
towns in S. Tunisia. Through Capsa ran the important caravan-routes
between Tebessa and Gabes, those to Feriana, Sbeïtla, and Susa, and
viâ Tozeur to the Limes Tripolitanus (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>). With the exception of the
Piscinæ (see below) all the Roman structures have been demolished for
modern building purposes. The town-walls were rebuilt by Solomon
(p. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>) in Justinian’s reign, and in the Moorish period were succeeded
by a triple mud-built wall, of which scarcely a trace is left. The Byzantine
citadel, built of Roman materials, was succeeded by the Moorish
Kasba, which the French have now converted into barracks. Since the
entry of the French troops in 1881 the mosques have been regarded as
desecrated.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the new <i>Gafsa-Gare</i> quarter a street leads to the Oued
Baïech, crosses it, where native washerwomen and thirsty camels
often present an entertaining scene, and ascends on the border of
the oasis (p. <a href='#Page_385'>385</a>) to the old town, dominated by groups of palm-trees
and two minarets.</p>

<p class='c011'>The large Champ de Foire and the <i>Fondouk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_281'>281</a>), on the
E. side of the town, are full of life when caravans arrive with their
dates from the Djerid (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>). The corn-market in the <i>Halle aux
Grains</i> also is of some importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Place du Marché (market on Wednesday), at the S.
end of the Champ de Foire, the Rue du Gén.-Philebert leads through
the town to the Place de la Kasba. Here, on the W. side, rises the
<i>Kasba</i>, with its towers and white pinnacled walls, once the chief
sight at Gafsa, but now the barracks of military convicts. View
from the Poste Optique (adm. on application). The <i>Jewish Quarter</i>
with its narrow streets, lies to the N.E. of the Place de la Kasba,
on the N. side of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dilapidated Roman <span class='sc'>Piscinæ</span> (Arabic <i>Termid</i>, from ‘thermæ’)
are still used as baths. The Jewish Bath is fed by the Kasba
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>spring. The largest basins, supplied by the hot spring outside the
Kasba and chiefly used by the Moslems, are in the <i>Dâr el-Bey</i>, to
the S.E. of the Place de la Kasba. The men’s bath (Termid er-Rayel),
where the children love to dive for sou-pieces, is worth seeing. In
the beautifully clear water tiny fish (Chromis, occurring also in the
underground waters of the Sahara), little black snakes, and small
tortoises disport themselves among the bathers.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the S. of the Piscinæ are the <i>Souks</i>. Foremost among
their wares are bright-coloured blankets (frechias), burnouses, and
carpets (guétifs), mostly made by the <i>Hamamas</i> (p. <a href='#Page_383'>383</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Sidi Yakûb Mosque</i> (Grande Mosquée), to the S.W. of the
Dâr el-Bey, one of the oldest in Tunisia, is noteworthy for its
interior with nave and eighteen aisles, in the style of the Sidi Okba
mosque at Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>). The minaret, especially towards
evening, affords a charming *View of the town and the oasis, and
of the finely shaped hills and the yellow desert to the S.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Oasis</b>, nearly 4 sq. M. in area, the richest and greenest
palm-oasis in all Barbary, offers many delightful walks. Most of
the paths conveniently overlook the little gardens lying below them,
watered by numerous runlets from the Piscinæ.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the shade of the palms grow apricots, peaches, figs, pomegranates,
quinces, almonds, pears, and olives, and here and there oranges and lemons.
The vine, with its vigorous and picturesque tendrils, climbs up the palm
trees or the nettle-trees (Celtis australis) planted for its support, yielding
ripe grapes as early as June. Below all these trees the soil is carpeted,
in the cooler season, with vegetables, melons, wheat, and barley. The W.
margin of the oasis, however, where water is scarce, yields olives only.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fine points of view are the hill of <i>Sidi Bou-Yahia</i>, crowned
with a kubba, on the N.W. margin of the oasis, the <i>Ksour Nala</i>,
a spur of Jebel Ben-Younès, and, separated from the latter by the
depression of the <i>Foum el-Maza</i>, <i>Jebel Assalah</i>, whence we survey

<p class='c022'>A <span class='sc'>Road</span> leads to the S.E. viâ the olive-oasis of <i>El-Ksar</i> to (3¾ M.)
<i>Leïla</i>, a charming little palm-oasis; then, aside from the <i>Sebkha d’el-Guettar</i>,
to (12½ M.) <b>El-Guettar</b> (952 ft.; two caravanserais; pop. 1800),
a palm and olive oasis at the S. base of <i>Jebel Orbata</i> (3839 ft.; fine view
from the Poste Optique; ascent by bridle-path 2½–3 hrs.). The route from
El-Guettar to (83 M.) <i>Gabes</i> (p. <a href='#Page_389'>389</a>), leading almost all the way through
an arid wilderness, is fit only for those who are used to fatigue and
privations. (Poor quarters at <i>Bir Saâd</i> and <i>El-Haffey</i> only.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Gafsa the train crosses the Oued Baïech and beyond
the oasis it enters the sandy and stony waste between the salt-marsh
<i>Garaet el-Oglal</i> (on the right) and the chain of <i>Jebel Rosfa</i> (1411 ft.)
and <i>Jebel Jellabia</i> (1346 ft.; to the S.). Beyond the dry bed of
the <i>Oued Melah</i> the long range of <i>Jebel Tarfaoui</i> (p. <a href='#Page_388'>388</a>) appears
far to the left.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>We skirt the S. base of <i>Jebel Stah</i> (2953 ft.), <i>Jebel Tarfai</i>
(2166 ft.), and <i>Jebel Metlaoui</i> (1805 ft.), all rich in phosphates.
These hills, overgrown with alfa-grass only, are, like those near
Gafsa, a favourite haunt of the gazelle; the maned sheep (p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>)
also occurs.</p>

<p class='c011'>151 M. <b>Metlaoui</b> (643 ft.; Hôt. Rey, R., déj., D., 3 fr. each,
quite good), Arabic <i>Metlâwi</i>, on the S. slope of <i>Jebel Seldja</i>,
not far from the <i>Oued Seldja</i> (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), lies in the heart of the S.
Tunisian phosphate-region, which extends to Redeyef (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), to
Aïn-Moularès (p. <a href='#Page_372'>372</a>), and to Jebel Mrata on the Algerian frontier.
The phosphate is detached from the hill-sides by blasting (foudroyage)
and then spread out to dry on the ground, where it is
turned over several times by ploughs. The works employ about
5000 hands, mostly Italians and natives, and yield about 800,000
tons per annum. Adm. to the ‘Grande Recette’ of the works by

<p class='c016'>Interesting walk or drive to the (3 M.) *<b>Gorges du Seldja</b>, a wild

<h3 class='c020'>61. From Metlaoui to the Djerid.</h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Road</span> viâ (35½ M.) <i>Tozeur</i> to (51 M.) <i>Nefta</i> (railway to the former
under construction). A carriage may be hired at one of the inns at
Metlaoui, but as the road is bad a mule is preferable. It is best to ride
direct to Tozeur (carrying provisions, wine, etc.). Nefta may be visited
from Tozeur, El-Oudiane best on the way back from Tozeur to Metlaoui
(early start required).</p>

<p class='c022'>The *<b>Djerid</b> (Arabic <i>Belad el-Jerid</i>), the narrow isthmus between
the <i>Chott Djérid</i> (65–80 ft. above the sea), the largest salt-marsh in Barbary,
and the <i>Chott Rharsa</i> (65 ft. below sea-level), with its four picturesque
oases of <i>Tozeur</i>, <i>Nefta</i>, <i>El-Oudiane</i>, and <i>El-Hamma</i> (<i>du Djérid</i>),
is the largest date-palm region in N. Africa. The number of palm-trees
is estimated at about a million, but nearly half belong to the ‘hakhana’,
an unfruitful species. The yield of dates is 12½–15,000 tons annually,
of which 500 tons only are of the transparent variety. They are exported
chiefly viâ Gafsa and Sfax. The mildness of the climate (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>) adapts
Tozeur in particular for winter residence, but malaria is prevalent in
summer. The population (about 30,000), which is said to have included
scattered remnants of Christian communities down to the 18th cent., is
chiefly of Berber origin, but with the Arab nature fully developed.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Metlaoui</i>, see above. The road leads to the S.W., through an
almost bare waste, at first near the left bank of the Seldja and then
down its dry bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>15½ M. <i>Bordj Gouïfla</i> (269 ft.; no drinking-water), a deserted
caravanserai, lies at the junction of the Gafsa road, beyond the influx
of the Oued Seldja into the <i>Oued Melah</i> (p. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>). We then
skirt the spurs of <i>Jebel Tarfaoui</i> (p. <a href='#Page_388'>388</a>). The road to El-Oudiane
(p. <a href='#Page_388'>388</a>) branches to the left.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>Not far from the delta of the Oued Melah we near the <i>Chott
Rharsa</i>, which in the hot season is reduced to a few streamlets
and pools, and next reach the E. border of (30 M.) the oasis of <b>El-Hamma
du Djérid</b> (164 ft.; Bordj, quarters 1 fr.). This oasis,
the smallest in the Djerid, with 900 inhab., about 54,000 palms,
and a few olive-trees, has of late had mud-walls (tabias) built to
shelter it from sand-drift. The <i>Hammâm</i>, a piscina in a kind of
palm-hut, whose water (109° Fahr.) is in high favour with the
natives, is of Roman origin.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road crosses the (32½ M.) downs of <i>Drah Tozeur</i> or <i>Drâht
en-Nadour</i> (269 ft.), and reveals a striking *View of the green
oasis of Tozeur and the glittering surface of the <i>Chott Djérid</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>35½ M. <b>Tozeur</b> (197 ft.; Hôt. Bellevue, R. 3, B. ½, déj. or
D. 3 fr., unpretending, with attentive landlady; pop. 10,000, incl.
65 Europeans), the ancient <i>Tusuros</i>, Arabic <i>Tûzer</i>, is the seat of
the authorities of the Djerid. The houses, mostly one-storied, built
of crude (tobs) and burned bricks, have a peculiar geometric ornamentation
in brick network, which differentiates them from most
of those in the other oases. The <i>Souks</i> are less important than
those of Nefta (see below). Interesting *Views are obtained from
the minarets of the <i>Zaouïa Sidi Abid</i> and the new <i>Sidi Mouldi
Mosque</i> (tickets at the Contrôle Civil).</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<span class='sc'>Oasis</span>, which is hardly inferior to that of Gafsa in richness and
variety of vegetation (p. <a href='#Page_385'>385</a>), contains about 420,000 palms. Several hours
may be pleasantly spent in riding to the chief points of interest. Leaving
the town we ride to the W., viâ <i>Chabia</i> village, with its curious huts
of palm-logs, to the <i>Râs el-Aïoun</i>, where 194 springs unite to form the
<i>Oued el-Mechta</i>. We then skirt the S.W. border of the oasis and descend
viâ the villages of <i>Zaouïet-Sahraoui</i>, <i>Djehim</i> or <i>Djem</i>, and <i>Abbas</i> or
<i>Abbès</i> to the kubba of <i>Sidi Ali Bou-Lifa</i>, near the shott, with a huge
and venerable lotus-tree. Thence we should return to Djehim and ride
to <i>Bled el-Adhar</i>, a village in the W. half of the oasis. The interesting
mosque here, the oldest in the Djerid, stands on the site of a
Roman temple, which is said to have been converted into a Christian
basilica. The *Mihrâb, or prayer-niche, unfortunately whitewashed, dating
from 1194, is most elegantly decorated in stucco. We return thence to
Tozeur, where the half-dead lotus-tree and the little mosques present a
picturesque bit of scenery.</p>

<p class='c009'>A <span class='sc'>Road</span>, with fine points of view, leads from Tozeur to the W.,
viâ <i>Chabia</i> (see above) and along the S. margin of the dunes of
<i>Koudiat Oum el-Arouah</i> (558 ft.), to (51 M.) <b>Nefta</b> (200–300 ft.;
Djerid Hotel, R. 3–4, B. 1, déj. or D. 3–4, pens. 8–10 fr., quite good;
carr. at the Khalifa’s only; pop. 14,000, incl. many Jews but only
a few Europeans), the Roman <i>Aggarsel Nepte</i>. The houses resemble
those of Tozeur in style, but blocks of gypsum from the
vicinity also have been used as building-material. We are struck
with the great number of small mosques and zaouïas, among which
is the zaouïa of the Kadria (p. <a href='#Page_361'>361</a>), the most important in S. Tunisia
and a religious house of the Rahmania order. The souks,
which are much patronized by the Sahara caravans, offer all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>products of the Djerid, such as white frechias (p. <a href='#Page_385'>385</a>), burnouses
(‘djeridi’), silk haiks, etc.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before riding through the *<b>Oasis</b> (2–3 hrs.; mule with guide 3–4 fr.),
the finest in the Djerid, with its 187,000 palms, we proceed from the
souks to the so-called *<i>Corbeille</i> (Arabic <i>Kasr el-Aïn</i>, ‘castle of the
springs’), a grand gorge in the middle of the town, where the copious
springs (152, it is said) unite to form a brook. We then ride to the N.W.,
past the <i>Zaouïa of the Kadria</i> (p. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>) and along the mud-walls (p. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>),
to the <i>Parcelle Forestière</i> (fine view), or to the <i>Poste Douanier</i>, another
good point of view. We then return, past the mosque of <i>Sidi Merzoug</i>
and the palm-garden of <i>Ghitane ech-Chorfa</i>, to the <i>Barrage</i>, a Roman
dam below the Corbeille (at the weir, a little lower, good bathing-place),
and visit the elegant kubba of <i>Sidi Bou-Ali</i>, in the heart of the oasis.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>El-Oudiane</b>, the eastmost oasis of the Djerid, with 6000 inhab.
distributed among six villages, lies 6¼ M. to the N.E. of Tozeur
and 3 M. to the E. of El-Hamma (p. <a href='#Page_387'>387</a>), on the slope of <i>Jebel Bou-Hellal</i>
(624 ft.), the W. offshoot of <i>Jebel Tarfaoui</i> (1821 ft.). This
oasis, 4½ M. long, watered by a number of small springs, possesses
about 185,000 palms and 25,000 olive-trees, while numerous orange
and lemon trees add a special charm. The chief village is <i>Deggach</i>
(180 ft.; pop. 3000), built partly of stone. Thence we ride past
<i>Zaouïet el-Arab</i>, with its minaret (fine view), and <i>Kriz</i>, on the
slope of <i>Jebel Nadour</i> (519 ft.), to the walled village of <i>Cedadda</i>
(230 ft.). At <i>Guebba</i>, a village adjoining Kriz, close to the shott,
are some Roman ruins.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Trik el-Oudiania</i>, a caravan route once used by the Romans
but sometimes impassable after heavy winter rains, leads from Kriz across
the Chott Djérid, to the S.E., to the <i>Caïdat du Nefzaoua</i>, a part of the
S. Territories (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>) between the shott and the Erg Oriental (p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>).
The first oasis beyond the salt-marshes is (30½ M.) <i>Debabcha</i>, on the
peninsula of that name. 43 M. <i>Telmine</i>, the ancient <i>Turris Tamaleni</i>,
was the westmost frontier-fortress on the Limes Tripolitanus (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>).
47 M. <b>Kebilli</b> (quarters in the Bordj), the ancient <i>Vepillium</i> (?), is now
the chief town in the Nefzaoua, with 5000 inhab., a market well attended
by the Sahara caravans, and the finest palm-oasis in this region.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Roads</span> lead from Kebilli: (1) To the N.E., through the waterless sandy
waste between the <i>Chott el-Fedjedj</i> (p. <a href='#Page_389'>389</a>) and <i>Jebel Tebaga</i> (1608 ft.) and
past (9½ M.) <i>Limagues</i> and (34½ M.) <i>Oglet Nakhla</i>, to (53 M.) <b>El-Hamma</b>
(quarters at the Bordj), the ancient <i>Aquae Tacapitanae</i>, with hot springs

the <i>Chott el-Fedjedj</i> (76 ft. above sea-level), the E. continuation
of the Chott Djérid (p. <a href='#Page_386'>386</a>). In 1873 Ferd. de Lesseps (p. <a href='#Page_437'>437</a>)
suggested that, by cutting a canal through the isthmus, the whole
of the shotts, as far as the Chott Melrir (p. <a href='#Page_284'>284</a>), might be converted

<p class='c009'><i>Gabes</i> or <i>Gabès</i> (Europ. pop. 900, mostly Italians and Maltese;
total, incl. oasis, 10,200), the ancient <i>Tacape</i>, the chief harbour on
the stretch of coast called <i>Emporia</i> by the Greeks and a rival of
Leptis Magna and Tripoli (comp. p. <a href='#Page_407'>407</a>), is now the capital of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span><i>Arad</i> and headquarters for the S. Territories, which are still under
military rule. It is the only harbour of importance on the S. coast
of the <i>Gulf of Gabes</i> (p. <a href='#Page_405'>405</a>). The chief exports are the sponges
of the bay, alfa or esparto grass, dates, and woollen goods. In
the war annals of 1881 the bombardment of Gabes from Menzel
(see below) and the protracted resistance of the inland tribes are
memorable. It was here that Gen. Logerot intercepted the tribes
of the E. coast who tried to pass through the Arad to Tripolitania.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small <i>Harbour</i>, for fishing-boats only, at the mouth of the
<i>Oued Gabes</i>, protected by two stone piers, is exposed to every
wind and choked with sand.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N.W. of the estuary, on the border of the oasis, which
is here protected from sand-drift by palisades, rise low dunes; to
the S.E., near the lighthouse, is an admirable bathing-beach.</p>

<p class='c011'>The modern <span class='sc'>Gabès-Port</span>, adjoining the <i>Camp Militaire</i>, contains
no attraction except the garden of the <i>Cercle Militaire</i>. It
is garrisoned with 160 native horsemen (Spahis or Cavaliers du
Maghzen), who guard the Tripolitanian frontier of the S. Territories.
The tradespeople are mostly Jews.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Gabès-Port, also on the barren right bank of the river,
lie the large Berber villages, partly built of Roman materials, of
<span class='sc'>Djara</span> (<i>Grand-Djara</i>; pop. 3500) and <span class='sc'>Menzel</span> (pop. 4500, incl.
about 1000 Jews). The market-place of Djara, a square enclosed
by primitive arcades with shops, is frequented chiefly by the
S. Algerian caravans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost the only sight of Gabes is the beautiful, but in summer
malarious *<b>Oasis</b>, once somewhat over-praised by Pliny, which
extends 3¾ M. up the left bank of the river and is 1–1¼ M. in
breadth. Among the remarkably tall and well-grown date-palms
(about 200,000) are many bananas and other fruit-trees. The river
and the small channels, often enlivened by women washing or carrying
water, are crossed by numerous bridges of palm-logs. A walk
or ride to the most interesting spots takes 3–4 hrs. (mule 2–3 fr.).
From Menzel we go upstream to the <i>Barrage du Sidi el-Bey</i>
(1894), and past the remains of a Roman <i>Dam</i>, built of huge
blocks, to the <i>Râs el-Oued</i> (213 ft.), a hill at the W. end of the
oasis often covered with clouds of dust, where the principal feeders
of the river, 30 in all, form a number of waterfalls. Turning here,
we follow the largest irrigation-conduit to the village of <i>Chenini</i>
(pop. 1000) and cross the Sfax road (p. <a href='#Page_382'>382</a>) to the N.W. half of
the oasis, where many of the palms are overgrown with vines.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<b>Monts des Ksour</b> (p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>), bordering the Sahara on the S.
side of the Arad, are well worth visiting from Gabes or from Médenine
(p. <a href='#Page_391'>391</a>; carr. tariff, see p. <a href='#Page_389'>389</a>; an ample supply of food and rugs advisable;
comp. also p. <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>). These barren hills culminate in <i>Kef Toudjane</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_391'>391</a>), which is almost everywhere conspicuous from the coast, and <i>Jebel
Smerten</i> (each about 2100 ft.), and in <i>Kef Demeur</i> or <i>Jebel Demmer</i> (2460 ft.).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>The inhabitants, the <i>Troglodytes</i> of antiquity (see p. <a href='#Page_320'>320</a>), are, in the
N.W. part, the <i>Matmatas</i>, on the plateau of that name, and, in the S.,
members of the <i>Ouerghamma League</i>, Berber tribes which for centuries
withstood the attacks of the Arabs and the predatory Sahara nomads.
They still often live in caverns, with a court resembling a shaft as the
centre of their dwelling, and cavities used as side-rooms or offices. The
gardens, laboriously irrigated by dams and cisterns, yield olives, dates,
and figs; in the valleys grain, chiefly barley, and vegetables are cultivated.
The Matmatas often go to Tunis as porters or artisans but always return
home in their old age.</p>

<p class='c022'>A glimpse of this region is obtained by driving from Gabes to (28 M.)
<i>Matmata-Kebira</i> or <i>Kalaâ-Matmata</i> (1838 ft.; p. <a href='#Page_388'>388</a>; quarters at the
Kaïd’s), on the Matmata plateau, whence an excursion (on mule-back)
should, if possible, be taken to the picturesque rock-village of <i>Hadege</i>.
A new but very hilly road leads from Matmata-Kebira through the mountains
viâ (12½ M.) <i>Toudjane</i> (919 ft.), a village grandly situated on the
slopes of <i>Kef Toudjane</i> (2090 ft.), direct to (37½ M.) <i>Métameur</i> (see

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Médenine Road</span> (diligence, see p. <a href='#Page_388'>388</a>) now leads to the
S.E. through a steppe-like hill-country, fringing the Monts des
Ksour (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>) and intersected by many valleys, passing the small
oases of <i>Menara</i> (200 ft.) and (55 M.) <i>Teboulbou</i> (artesian wells;

<p class='c011'>74 M. <i>Mareth</i> (Bordj), a large palm-oasis on the <i>Oued Mareth</i>.
We then cross the <i>Oued Zigraou</i> to (77 M.) <i>Aram</i>. Beyond the

the Monts des Ksour (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the valleys of the <i>Oued Zeus</i> and <i>Oued Hallouf</i> the
road rounds <i>Jebel Tadjera</i> (968 ft.; Poste Optique). 97½ M.
<i>Métameur</i>, formerly a ‘camp militaire’, on the brook of that name,
below the small oasis and (½ hr.) Berber village of <i>Ksar Métameur</i>
(391 ft.), whose storehouses (rhorfas), with keel-arched vaulting,
recall very ancient buildings in Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c011'>101 M. <b>Médenine</b> (361 ft.; Médenine Hôtel, R. 2½, B. ½,
déj. 2½ fr., good; pop. 1000, incl. 100 Europeans), capital of the
<i>Ouerghamma</i> (see above), the league of the Berber tribes <i>Khezour</i>,
<i>Touazine</i>, <i>Ouderna</i>, and <i>Accara</i>. The high-lying <i>Camp Militaire</i>,
with its garrison of Spahis (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>) and Infanterie Légère d’Afrique
(‘Joyeux’), is the largest on the Tripolitanian frontier.</p>

<p class='c011'>The deserted and ruinous *<i>Ksar</i>, in a small palm-oasis, consists
of a great number of the old storehouses of the League, some
of them in four or five stories, now replaced by retbas or rabtas
(p. <a href='#Page_338'>338</a>). They are dug deeply in the hill-side, and are accessible
only by stairs of mud or stepping-stones.</p>

<p class='c016'>Travellers used to privations and content with such poor quarters
as the natives can offer may, after consulting the military authorities
at Médenine, visit the S. part of the <i>Monts des Ksour</i> (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>). The best
centre there is (34 M.) <b>Tatahouine</b>, the seat of the military and civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>authorities, with an important market, well attended by caravans on
their way from the Sahara and the Sudan by way of Ghadâmes in Tripolitania
(p. <a href='#Page_285'>285</a>). The chief villages of the cave-dwellers (Ksûr) near
this are <i>Tlalet</i>, formerly <i>Talalati</i>, a frontier-fortress on the Limes Tripolitanus
(p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>), <i>Beni-Barca</i>, *<i>Chenini</i>, and *<i>Douirat</i> (2090 ft.).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Zarzis Road</span> (37½ M.) descends to the E. from Médenine
through the sandy coast-plain to (15½ M.) <i>Aïn-Mader</i>, near the
saline marshes of that name on the S. bank of the Mer de Bou-Grara
(see below), and then traverses the hill-region of the <i>Accara</i> tribe
(p. <a href='#Page_391'>391</a>), between the sea and the large <i>Sebkha el-Melah</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the left, a little off the road, 4 M. from Zarzis, are the ruins
of the little Roman town of <i>Zita</i>, now <i>Zian</i>, where the small
forum is still enclosed with the remains of its colonnade.</p>

<p class='c011'>37½ M. (or from Graïba 138½ M.) <b>Zarzis</b> (accommodation at
the Bordj), on the site of the Roman seaport <i>Gergis</i>, amidst extensive
olive-groves famed for their oil, has two artesian wells and a small
harbour for fishing-boats. Important sponge-fishery.</p>

<p class='c011'>A road (the chief route to the island of Djerba) leads to the
N.W. from Zarzis across the <i>Péninsule de Zarzis</i> or <i>des Accara</i>
to (14½ M., or, from Graïba, 153 M.) <i>Marsa el-Kantara</i>, a village
near the <i>Râs Marmor</i>, on the S. side of the E. entrance
(1¼ M. wide) to the Mer de Bou-Grara (see below). The dilapidated
Roman dam which crosses the strait here to El-Kantara is still
used by camel-caravans at low tide (6½ ft. below high-water), but
it is better to cross by fishing-boat. From El-Kantara to <i>Houmt-Souk</i>,
see p. <a href='#Page_394'>394</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Djorf Bou-Grara Route</span> to Djerba is shorter (30 M.) and
will repay antiquarians. The rough road (mule preferable to carr.)
leads from Médenine to the N.E. viâ <i>Bir Saâdou</i>, and then past
some small salt-marshes, to the <i>Mer de Bou-Grara</i>, a large landlocked
bay between the mainland and the island of Djerba, accessible
for large vessels by the <i>Canal d’Adjim</i> only (not quite 1 M.
across; see p. <a href='#Page_393'>393</a>). This bay, in which fish abound, and Lake
Bizerta (p. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>) are the best natural harbours in Tunisia.</p>

<p class='c011'>17½ M. (or from Graïba 118½ M.) <b>Djorf Bou-Grara</b> (no
inn) is near the site of *<i>Gightis</i>, a small Punic-Roman seaport,
which attained great prosperity in the 2nd cent. A.D. The harbour,
which was always shallow at low tide, is now entirely silted up.
Excavations begun in 1896 have revealed the ruins of curiously
cramped and irregular streets, with various public buildings, villas
remarkable for their coloured incrustation and rich mosaics, and
Byzantine houses built of Roman materials.</p>

<p class='c016'>A broad street ascends from the harbour to the <i>Macellum</i>, with fountain
and exedra similar to those at Timgad (p. <a href='#Page_295'>295</a>). The small <i>Forum</i>,
60 by 44 yds., has on the E. side an archway, the <i>Curia</i>, and the <i>Market
Basilica</i>, with the tribunal, while the <i>Severus Arch</i> on the N. side formed
a lateral entrance. On the S. side rises the <i>Capitol</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_288'>288</a>), in the
style of the capitol or ‘Jupiter temple’ at Pompeii.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span><i>The Temple of Mercury</i>, to the S. of the forum, has columns in its
peribolos, or outer wall, with curious capitals adorned with cables, in
allusion to the occupation of the founder. The building is curiously
planned, having several small rooms or ‘sacristies’ behind the cella; it
is adjoined by a chapel of Mercury and one of Minerva.</p>

<p class='c022'>A <i>Temple of Isis</i> (<i>?</i>), a <i>Temple of Hygiea</i>, the <i>Thermae</i>, and a late-Punic
<i>Cemetery</i> also have been unearthed.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a fishing-boat is available at Djorf Bou-Grara we may sail
direct to <i>Adjim</i> (p. <a href='#Page_394'>394</a>; 13½ M. in ca. 1½ hr.). If not, we must
go 12½ M. farther to (30 M., or from Graïba, 131 M.) <i>Marsa el-Adjim</i>
at the <i>Râs el-Djorf</i>, the N. point of the peninsula, opposite
Adjim (1⅓ M. distant; boat in ¼ hr.).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Island of Djerba</b> (highest point 118 ft.), 17½ by 14 M.,
is the largest on the N. African coast. From the lotus-tree (Zizyphus
Lotus; Arabic nebga, Fr. jujubier), which thrives here,
Homer called it the island of the <i>Lotophagi</i>. It was later named
<i>Meninx</i> and was the birthplace of the Roman emperors Vibius
Gallus and Volusianus (251–3). It is now one of the most fertile
and prosperous regions in Tunisia. Secure in their insularity
against the attacks of the nomadic Arabs, the inhabitants (about
40,000), mostly Berbers of the Kharijite sect (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), have retained
their old language and customs. They vie in industry with their
kinsmen the Mozabites (p. <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>) and go forth as traders to all the
seaports of the Orient. Agriculture also thrives. There are 1,300,000
date-palms, 500,000 olive-trees, and as many orange, lemon, and
peach trees; early vegetables too are now largely grown. The
sponge, polypus, and other fisheries and the oyster-beds in the
Canal d’Adjim (p. <a href='#Page_392'>392</a>) are very productive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Djerba has four harbours, <i>Houmt-Souk</i>, <i>Adjim</i>, <i>El-Kantara</i>,
and <i>Aghir</i>. The only towns are Houmt-Souk, <i>Hara-Kebîra</i>, and
<i>Hara-Serîra</i>; the villages are merely local markets for their
districts. The countless little mosques have white domes like most
of the houses, but are distinguished by conspicuous slender minarets
of the Turkish type, resembling lighthouses. The farm-houses
(menzel) scattered throughout the island often have a castellated
appearance. In the entire absence of brooks the soil is irrigated
from cisterns and wells, among which are two very copious artesian
wells. The winter climate (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>) is the mildest in Tunisia, but
gales are frequent. For excursions there are few carriages available
(20 fr. per day); the usual conveyance is an araba or country-cart;
for a mule the charge is 4–5, for a donkey 3 fr. per day. The
tourist should beware of the countless scorpions, especially in the
warmer season.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Houmt-Souk</b> (Hôt. de l’Oasis or Crolet; Hôt. de France; Brit.
cons. agent; pop. 5900, incl. 560 Maltese, French, Italians, and
Greeks), the capital of the island, lies on the sandy N. coast, ½ M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>from the sea and 5 M. from the anchorage of the steamers (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_405'>405</a>). The dilapidated <i>Bordj el-Kebîr</i> on the shore recalls the
time of the Spanish domination. Near it is the <i>Christian Cemetery</i>,
where repose the bones, collected in 1848, of the 18,000 Spaniards
who were massacred here in 1560 after the naval victory of Dragut
(p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>) and Ochiali Pasha, and yielded trophies for the ghastly
Bordj er-Rious (tower of skulls).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the interesting <i>Souks</i> (Mon. and Thurs.) are seen all the
products of the island. Among the numerous religious buildings
may be named the <i>Mosquée el-Gheriba</i> and the <i>Mosquée des Turcs</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>A road leads to the S. from Houmt-Souk to the Jewish villages of
(¾ M.) <i>Hara-Kebîra</i> (pop. 3500) and (4½ M.) <b>Hara-Serîra</b> or <i>Hara-Sghîra</i>
(pop. 1500), where numerous goldsmiths make silver-gilt trinkets
of antique and Byzantine patterns, with enamel and jewels (mostly imitation).
The <i>Gheriba</i>, the synagogue of Hara-Serîra, where, according to
an old tradition, one of the tables of the law of Moses was once found,
is a great resort of Jewish pilgrims from S. Tunisia and Tripolitania,
and is much revered by Moslems and Catholics also.—From Hara-Serîra
the road leads to the S. to (14½ M.) <b>Guallala</b>, the centre of the pottery-manufacture
carried on in Djerba ever since ancient times (oil-jars, porous
water-jugs, vases, etc.). Near it is the hill of <i>Dahrat-Guallala</i>, which
yields the clay.</p>

<p class='c022'>A road leads to the S.E. from Houmt-Souk viâ <i>Hara-Kebîra</i> (see above)
and (10⅓ M.) <i>Cedouikeche</i> (potteries) to (15½ M.) <b>El-Kantara</b>, the seaport
for Zarzis (p. <a href='#Page_392'>392</a>), not far from the extensive but unimportant ruins
of <i>Meninx</i>, the ancient capital of the island.—Another road leads to the
S.W. to (14 M.) <b>Adjim</b>, a rising little seaport and market (Wed.), with
an artesian well 760 ft. deep. To <i>Djorf Bou-Grara</i> (and <i>Gightis</i>), see
p. <a href='#Page_392'>392</a>.</p>

<p class='c022'>Near the E. coast of the island, on the roads to the <i>Râs Taguermess</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>) and the small summer harbour of <i>Aghir</i>, lie the villages of
<b>Midoune</b> (Frid. market) and <i>Mahboubine</i>, with many villas of the
merchants of Houmt-Souk, situated amid palm and olive groves and charming
*Fruit Gardens, where the oranges and lemons blossom in March. On
the road to Midoune is the <i>Mausolée de Borgho</i>, the only intact Roman
monument in the island.</p>

money is the currency at Malta, but French and Italian gold
are in general use.</p>

<p class='c009'>The steamers follow the Palermo and Naples course (comp.
R. 26) as far as <i>Cape Bon</i>, and then steer to the E.S.E. into the
<i>Straits of Pantelleria</i> or <i>Sicilian Straits</i> (p. xxx).</p>

<p class='c011'>The island of <i>Pantelleria</i> (p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>), which is sighted in clear
weather off Cape Bon, is passed by the French steamers at night.
The lighthouse of <i>Spadillo</i> (68 ft.), on the N. E. point of the island,
long remains in sight. The distant <i>Linosa</i> (610 ft.; ancient
<i>Æthusa</i>), with a lighthouse, is visible only in very clear weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early morning the abrupt coasts of <i>Gozo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_403'>403</a>) and
<i>Malta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>) appear in the distance. The vessel rounds the island
of Gozo, whose lighthouse on the <i>Giurdan Hill</i> (499 ft.) on the
N. side, is visible for 27 M.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Râs el-Kala</i>, the E. point of Gozo, we sight the narrow
<i>Straits of Flieghi</i> or <i>Comino Channels</i>, lying between Gozo and
Malta, and named alter the island of <i>Comino</i> (p. <a href='#Page_397'>397</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Maltese Islands</b> (<i>Isŏle Maltesi</i>), composed of tertiary
rock formation, were considered by earlier geographers to belong
to Africa, but are now assigned to Europe. They lie halfway between
the Straits of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, on the chief route
from the Atlantic to the Levant and to India. The principal island
is <i>Malta</i>, with the capital <i>Valletta</i> and many small towns and
villages (<i>casal</i>). It is 20 M. long, 9¾ M. broad, and, at its culminating
point, 847 ft. in height. The island is much over-peopled.
So is the island of <i>Gozo</i> (600 ft.), which measures 10¼ by 5¼ M.;
but <i>Comino</i> (248 ft.), 1¼ by 1 M., is uninhabited. The mean
temperature of the year is 66½° Fahr., of January 53½° (almost
the same as that of Djerba and Tripoli), of August 79½°. Gales,
particularly the dreaded N.E. wind (<i>Gregale</i>), often make a winter
residence in Malta uncomfortable, while the <i>Sirocco</i> (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>), here
very moist, is specially trying in autumn.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first sight the islands seem destitute of vegetation, the fields
and gardens being enclosed by lofty walls, while the growth of
trees is prevented by the violent winds. By means of laborious
tilling and artificial irrigation about a third of the area of the
islands has been converted into luxuriantly fertile arable land.
After the corn and hay harvest in May and June the land is sown
a second time, mostly with cotton, afterwards manufactured in the
interior. Among other valuable products are early vegetables and
potatoes, which yield two crops in the year. The oranges are excellent
but other fruits are scarce. Cattle, poultry, and eggs are
largely imported from Turkey, Tunisia, Tripolitania, and Barca
(p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The population of Malta (96½ sq. M.), is ca. 184,000, apart
from the garrison (nearly 9000 soldiers); that of Gozo (27 sq. M.)
is 21,200. The British and foreign residents number about 10,000.
The natives, especially in the seaports, Phœnician in origin, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>partly descended from the various races that have here held sway.
The <i>lingua Maltese</i> is akin to Arabic, but has borrowed much from
the Sicilian dialect of Italian, and of late from English also. The
educated classes speak Italian which is used also in the law-courts.
The language of commerce is English. The <i>faldetta</i>, the peculiar
black head-dress of the women, is the sole relic of the old national
costumes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Maltese are much attached to the church of Rome, and
nowhere in so small a community are the churches so numerous
and gorgeous. About one-third of the soil is said to belong to the
clergy. The Maltese are well-known throughout the Mediterranean
as enterprising mariners, merchants, and fishermen. Their island
being the most densely peopled region in the Mediterranean next
to Monaco, an immense number of the inhabitants have emigrated
during the last century. From 1807 onwards they settled largely
in the Tunisian seaports, from Tabarca to Zarzis, where they formed
the bulk of the Christian population, but of late they have had to
contend against the growing competition of the Sicilians and other
Italians. In Algeria they have formidable rivals in the Italians and
Spaniards. Within the last few decades the stream of emigration
has flowed chiefly to Tripolitania, Barca, Egypt, and even to
Zanzibar and Delagoa Bay.</p>

<p class='c016'>Malta is supposed to be identical with the island of <i>Ogygia</i> described
by Homer, where Odysseus is fabled to have been enslaved by the nymph
Calypso, whose alleged cavern is still pointed out on the N. coast of Malta,
and also in the island of Gozo. Between 3000 and 2000 B.C. a prehistoric
race (Hamitic?), probably from Libya, settled in Malta. Of their stage
of civilization, which lasted a thousand years, traces are still found in the
massive stone structures in the cyclopean style, which reveal, especially
in their circular ground-plan, an affinity with the <i>sesi</i> of Pantelleria,
the <i>nuraghi</i> of Sardinia (see p. <a href='#Page_145'>145</a>), and the megalithic monuments
of Barbary, S.E. Spain, and the Balearic Islands, and fall within the sphere
of influence of pre-Mycenæan (‘insular’) and Mycenæan culture. Later
the Phœnicians of Sidon founded a colony here, which soon became important
enough to send forth settlers to Acholla (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>) on the Tunisian
coast. Next, in 736 B. C., came Greek immigrants, and two centuries later
the Carthaginians, who took possession of the island. They now called
it <i>Melita</i> and had a capital of that name (now Notabile), but they in
their turn were ousted by the Romans in 218 B. C. It was on the N. coast
of Melita that St. Paul was wrecked in 62 A. D. (Acts, xxvii. xxviii).
He was received and courteously lodged by Publius, the governor, and
founded a Christian community in the island before resuming his voyage.
Four centuries later came the Vandals (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), and after another century
the Byzantines, who in 870 were driven out by Moors from Tunis. Under
the Moors the island was infested with pirates. At length when the Normans
under Roger conquered Sicily in 1090, Malta also fell under their
sway, and thenceforward it shared the fortunes of Sicily until 1522. In that
year arrived the Knights of St. John, banished from Rhodes by the Turks,
and to that Order in 1530 Malta, Gozo, and Tripoli were granted by
Emp. Charles V. The knights then took the name of Knights of Malta
and gallantly defended their island, which became one of the great bulwarks
of Christianity, against the repeated attacks of the Turks. The
most fearful siege they sustained was that of Borgo (Vittoriosa, p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>)
in 1565, when they were attacked by the whole forces of Suleiman the
Great under Dragut (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>), Mustapha, and Piali. In consequence of that
event the Grand Master Jean de la Valette founded and fortified the
new town of La Valette (Valletta), which became the capital and was
deemed impregnable. In 1798 Bonaparte, when on his way to Egypt,
gained possession of the town by treachery and stratagem; but on 8th Sept.
1800, after a siege of two years by the Maltese, assisted by British and
Neapolitan troops, the French garrison was compelled to capitulate and
leave the island. Since the treaty of Paris (1814) Malta has belonged
to Britain.—The present governor of the island is <i>Lt.-Gen. Sir H. M.
Rundle, K. C. B.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>The island of <b>Malta</b> presents an undulating and richly varied
N.E. coast, but on the rocky S.W. side it rises abruptly from the
sea. The <i>Grand Harbour</i> and the <i>Marsamuscetto Harbour</i>, the
two grand natural harbours of Valletta, originally valleys hollowed
out during the tertiary period, form one of the most important of
British war-harbours and the headquarters of the Mediterranean
fleet. Owing to its central position Malta is also a great coaling-station,
vying with Gibraltar, Algiers, and Genoa. In 1908–9 the
harbour was entered and cleared by 3212 vessels of 4,036,752 tons
of burden.</p>

to <i>Notabile</i> (p. <a href='#Page_403'>403</a>; cathedral, bastions, museum), or to <i>Gozo</i> (p. <a href='#Page_403'>403</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Valletta</i> or <i>Valetta</i> (197 ft.; pop. 25,000, or incl. Floriana
32,000), the capital of Malta, is the seat of the Governor (see
p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>), of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Forces
(Gen. Sir Ian Hamilton), and of a University founded in 1769. It
lies in 35°34′ N. lat. and 14°31′ E. long., at the extremity of the
peninsula, formerly called <i>Monte Sceberras</i>, 1½ M. long and ½ M.
broad, between the <i>Grand Harbour</i> (to the S.E.) and the <i>Marsamuscetto
Harbour</i> (to the N.W.). Enthroned above its harbours,
with its grand fortifications partly hewn in the rock, the model of a
16th. cent, fortress, it presents a very striking appearance when
approached from the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite Valletta, on the three central creeks of the Grand Harbour,
lie the ‘Three Cities’ of <i>Borgo</i> (Malt. <i>Birgu</i>; pop. 6200), the
oldest seat of the Maltese Order, also called <i>Vittoriosa</i> since the
great Turkish siege, <i>Sénglea</i> (pop. 8100), and <i>Búrmola</i> or <i>Cospicua</i>
(pop. 14,100), with the naval arsenal. In the Marsamuscetto Harbour
lies the island of <i>Jezira</i>, with the Lazzaretto, beyond which,
on the <i>Sliema Creek</i>, rises the town of <i>Sliema</i> (pop. 12,000).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <b>Fortifications</b> were an object of ceaseless attention under the
rule of the Order. The oldest part of them is <i>Fort St. Angelo</i>, originally
built by the Moors in 870 and renewed in 1530, which in the siege of
1565 proved the chief bulwark of Borgo. <i>Fort St. Elmo</i>, originally built
in 1488 but now entirely altered, fell into the hands of the Turks in
1565. The town-wall of <i>Borgo</i> was built in 1530 and that of <i>Sénglea</i> in
1554. The *Town Walls of <i>Valletta</i>, with their thirty bastions, deep
moats, drawbridges, and casemates, date chiefly from the time of the
foundation of the town (1566–71). The outworks of <i>Floriana</i> are of 1635.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>The older ramparts of Vittoriosa, Senglea, and Burmola, called the
<i>Firenzuola Lines</i>, were strengthened by the addition of new outworks
in 1668 called the <i>Cottonera Lines</i>. The later harbour-forts are <i>Fort
Ricasoli</i>, of 1670, <i>Fort Manoel</i> in Jezira, of 1732, and <i>Fort Tigné</i>, of
1792. All these works are supplemented by the British <i>Harbour Batteries</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The streets ascend steeply from the two harbours, many of
them by means of long flights of steps. The main business streets
are the <span class='sc'>Strada Reale</span>, leading on the top of the peninsula from
Fort St. Elmo to Porta Reale (over ½ M.), and the Strada Mercanti.
From the latter the Strada Cristoforo descends past the
<i>University</i>, established in an old Jesuit college (Strada San Paolo
109), to the <i>Lower Barracca Gardens</i>, a bastion affording a
good survey of the mouth of the harbour and the ‘Three Cities’.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plain <span class='sc'>Palace</span>, once the seat of the Grand Master and now
that of the governor of Malta (see p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>), was erected in 1573–7
by <i>Girolamo Cassar</i> in the Strada Reale and Piazza Tesoreria, in
the centre of the town. The garden court on the left is adorned with
a bronze statue of Neptune by <i>Giovanni da Bologna</i>; in the court
on the right rises a huge Araucaria excelsa. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>; entrance
by the green gate in the upper court.</p>

<p class='c016'>The chief attraction is the <span class='sc'>Palace Armoury</span> on the first floor, containing
armour, weapons, flags, and trophies of the Order (catalogue 5<i>s.</i>).
The principal hall, 88 yds. long, contains also state-coaches in the pseudo-classical
style and charters of Pope Paschalis II. (1113) and Charles V.
(1530; investiture of the Order). On the walls of the adjacent corridor
are painted views of old Malta. The Council Room on the left is hung
with superb Gobelins, designed by <i>Franç. Desportes</i> (1703). The wall-paintings
represent naval battles fought by the Order.</p>

<p class='c009'>An inscription on the Doric portico of the <i>Main Guard</i>, opposite
the N.W. façade of the Palace, records the cession of Malta
to Great Britain. A band often plays in the square in the evening.
In the Piazza Tesoreria, opposite the S.W. façade of the Palace, is
the <i>Public Library</i> of 56,000 vols. (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>; entrance under
the arcades).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Cathedral of San Giovanni</span> (<i>St. John’s</i>), to the left in the
second side-street in the direction of the Porta Reale, built in
1573–7 by <i>Girol. Cassar</i>, and lavishly decorated in the interior,
was the Order’s temple of fame. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Interior.</span> The oil-paintings on the barrel-vaulting are by <i>Mattia
Preti</i> (‘il Cavaliere Calabrese’; 1613–99). On the floor are about 400 slabs
of coloured marble, tombstones of the knights. The chapels dedicated to
the nine nations of the Order are lined with a number of tombstones of
Grand Masters, mostly in the baroque or rococo style. In the Portuguese
chapel (2nd on the right) are those of Ant. Manoel de Vilhena (1722–36)
and Manoel Pinto de Fonseca (1741–73), the founder of the university.—In
the Crypt, below the high-altar (of 1686), repose, among others, L’Isle
Adam (1530–4), the first Maltese Grand Master, and Jean de la Valette
(1557–68), the gallant defender of Borgo (see p. <a href='#Page_398'>398</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Sumptuous Brussels tapestry (1697–1701), after designs by <i>Rubens</i>
and <i>Mattia Preti</i>, is hung up in the church on festivals.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<span class='sc'>Valletta Museum</span>, Strada San Giovanni 38, opposite the
façade of the Cathedral, affords an admirable survey of the history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>of Maltese art and culture from the prehistoric age down to the
close of the Knights’ period. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>; no catalogue; curator,
Dr. Themistocles Zammit.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Entrance Room.</span> On the left the ‘sacred stone’ from the Torre dei
Giganti (p. <a href='#Page_404'>404</a>); Roman inscriptions from Gozo (about 140 A. D.); a fine
Norman capital, Norman and Cufic (early Arabic) inscriptions, etc.; also
models of stone balconies and of a Norman window at Victoria (p. <a href='#Page_404'>404</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>First Floor.</span> Prehistoric objects from Egypt (the Faiyûm); the Lord
Grenfell collection of Egyptian antiquities; Greek vases from Benghazi
and Cyrene; Arabian glass, etc.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Second Floor.</span> In the <i>Ante Room</i> are Roman sculptures.—The <i>Chief
Hall</i> contains prehistoric, Phœnician, Punic, and Roman objects from tombs
in Malta and Gozo. By the entrance-wall is a large collection of vases
arranged in types. In the last case are potsherds from various neolithic
stations. By the back-wall are prehistoric finds from Hal-Saflieni (see
below) and Hagiar Kim (p. <a href='#Page_403'>403</a>), vases, amulets, projectiles, flint implements,
seven seated stone figures, etc.; adjacent, on the left, is the unique
Phœnician-Greek dedicatory inscription in which Phœnician characters
were for the first time deciphered (on the right, cast of a similar inscription
in the Louvre). By the window-wall are copies and models of the so-called
chief temple of Hagiar Kim and of Phœnician tombs; also an Arabian
tombstone (1173), with a long Cufic inscription. In the first case in the
centre is Phœnician glass; in the fourth, a Phœnician terracotta sarcophagus,
with the recumbent figure of the deceased. The <i>Second Room</i>
contains memorials of the period of the Order.—In the <i>Passage</i> are drawings
of the Roman house at Notabile (p. <a href='#Page_403'>403</a>) and its mosaics.—The <i>Third
Room</i> contains old plans, maps, and views of Malta of old; model of a
state-galley of the Grand Masters; a collection of coins from the Phœnician
age to the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each of the nine nations of the Order had its own ‘auberge’ or
house of assembly. Most of these were built by Girol. Cassar. The
<i>Auberge d’Aragon</i> is in the Piazza Celsi. At the upper end of the
town are the <i>Aub. de Provence</i>, at the corner of the Strada Reale
and Strada Britannica, the <i>Aub. d’Italie</i> (1574), in the Strada Mercanti,
opposite the post-office, and the handsome <i>Aub. de Castille</i>
(1574; altered in 1744), in the Piazza Regina.—A few paces from
the Piazza Regina are the <i>Upper Barracca Gardens</i> (laid out on
the large bastion of Barracca Superiore; lift, see p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>), embellished
with numerous statues, and affording a fine view of the Grand
Harbour, especially by evening light.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the <i>Porta Reale</i> (P. R. on the map) we reach the plateau
between Valletta and the suburb of <span class='sc'>Floriana</span>. Near the gate is the
tramway-station (p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>). On the right, farther on, is the <i>Parade
Ground</i>. In the middle of the plateau, beyond the bronze statue
of <i>Ant. Manoel de Vilhena</i> (p. <a href='#Page_401'>401</a>), runs the long narrow <i>Maglio
Garden</i>, enclosed by high walls. Farther on we come to the bastions
of Floriana, on which are situated the <i>Argotti</i> or <i>Botanic
Garden</i>, belonging to the university, and the <i>Sarrìa</i>, a handsome
church of the Maltese Order (1678).</p>

<p class='c016'>At <i>Casal Paula</i> or <i>Paula</i>, 2 M. to the S. of Floriana, beyond the
<i>Creek of Marsa</i>, lies the prehistoric <i>Hypogaeum of Hal Saflieni</i>, containing
circular caves, some of them richly decorated, of the period of the neolithic

After the long tunnel under Floriana come the stations of <i>Hamrun</i>,
<i>Misida</i>, <i>Birchircara</i>, and (4½ M.) <i>Attard</i> (Alb. Melita). About
10 min. to the N. of Attard is the <i>Palace of Sant’Antonio</i> (1625),
once the summer seat of the Grand Master (visitors admitted to the
fine garden). The road in front of the palace goes on to (2 M.) <i>Musta</i>,
with a remarkable church, whose huge dome, 118 ft. in diameter,
was constructed in 1853–64 without the aid of scaffolding.</p>

<p class='c011'>7 M. <b>Notábile</b> or <b>Città Vecchia</b> (Hôt. du Point-de-Vue,
with fine view, pens. 7–8<i>s.</i>; pop. 7500), still popularly called
<i>Medina</i> (Arabic for ‘town’), the seat of the bishop, was the old
fortified capital of the island as far back as the Roman age.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Notabile station a road leads to the Piazza Sakkaya, on
the hill between the old town and the S. suburb of <i>Rábato</i>. Thence
we pass through the Porta dei Greci to <i>St. Paul’s Cathedral</i> (San
Paolo), before whose portal are planted cannons as in the time of the
Order. The sumptuous interior contains many marble tombstones
of Maltese bishops. Fine choir-stalls of 1480. The Strada dei
Bastioni behind the church commands an extensive view.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Museum Road, not far from the Piazza Sakkaya, is a Roman
house, excavated in 1881, now converted into a <i>Museum</i>, containing
mosaic pavements, statues, bronzes, and glass (fee 3<i>d.</i>).—The
adjacent <i>Esplanade</i> affords a fine view of Musta, the town-walls
of Notabile, and the pleasant green valley at the foot of the <i>Imtarfa
Hill</i>, with the barracks and the Museum Station (terminus
of the railway, which goes through a tunnel under Notabile).</p>

<p class='c011'>The parish church of <i>San Paolo</i>, in the Piazza Parrocchiale of
the suburb of Rabato, stands over a cavern, in which, according to
the legend, St. Paul dwelt during his three months’ stay in the island
in the year 62. From the church the Strada San Cataldo and Strada
Sant’ Agata soon lead to the <i>Catacombs of St. Paul</i> and the
<i>Cemetery of St. Agatha</i>, both pre-Christian in origin but used in
Christian times (fee 3<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p class='c016'>To the N.W. of Notabile rise the <i>Bingemma Hills</i> (784 ft.), with
Phœnician rock-tombs and a fort on the coast.—About 2 M. to the S.W. of
Notabile, near <i>Casal Dingli</i>, is the <i>Naval Signal Station</i> (847 ft.), the
highest point in the island, whence we overlook the whole group of islands
and the surrounding sea.—Some 2 M. to the S. of Notabile lies the
<i>Boschetto</i>, a large public garden (carr., see p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>), adjoining the <i>Verdala
Palace</i> (1586), once a summer seat of the Grand Masters (now that of the
governors).—To the S.E. is (4½ M.) <i>Casal Krendi</i> (carr., see p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>),
near the luxuriantly wooded gorge of <i>Makluba</i>, 132 ft. deep, probably
formed by an earthquake. We may visit (20 min. to the W.) the prehistoric
ruins of <i>Hagiar Kim</i>, buildings of huge blocks of stone without
mortar. About 7 min. farther to the W. are the similar ruins of <i>Mnaidra</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'><i>St. Paul’s Bay</i> (Baia di San Paolo; carr., see p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>) on the N. side of
the island, 5½ M. to the N. of Notabile, with the islet of <i>Selmun</i> (colossal
statue of the apostle), is the supposed scene of St. Paul’s shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sister island of <b>Gozo</b> (p. <a href='#Page_397'>397</a>), to the N.W. of Malta, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>ancient <i>Gaulos</i>, Maltese <i>Ghaudex</i>, which also was once fortified
by the Maltese Order, is more fertile and varied than the main island.
The coast is precipitous all round. The small local boat
(p. <a href='#Page_400'>400</a>) crosses in 1½ hr., affording a fine view of the N.E. coast
of Malta, and, on the way back, of the caves on the W. shore of
Comino. We land in <i>Migiarro</i> or <i>Miggiar Bay</i> (Malt. <i>Mjiar</i>), on
the S. coast of Gozo, below <i>Fort Chambré</i> (1750), where carriages
are in waiting (to Victoria and back 3<i>s.</i>, whole day 5<i>s.</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Victoria</i> (299 ft.; Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, and others; pop.
5000), called <i>Rábat</i> down to 1887, the capital and episcopal residence
of Gozo, lies in the centre of the island, 4 M. to the N.W. of
the landing-place. The streets show a good many relics of mediæval
architecture (comp. p. <a href='#Page_402'>402</a>). The neglected <i>Citadel</i> dates from 1600.
The women of Gozo are much occupied with lace-making.</p>

<p class='c016'>A branch of the road from the harbour to Victoria leads to the village
of <i>Sciarra</i> (486 ft.; Maltese <i>Casal Xaghra</i>). Below Sciarra, on a height
covered with fruit-trees, rises the <i>Torre dei Giganti</i> (Malt. <i>Ggantija</i>),
similar to the ruins of Hagiar Kim (p. <a href='#Page_403'>403</a>; adm. by leave of the proprietor,

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>From Tunis to <i>Cape Bon</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_153'>153</a>. Our steamer, generally
at night, next skirts the steep E. coast of Cape Bon, passes <i>Râs el-Mirh</i>,
and off <i>Râs el-Mustapha</i> steers to the S.S.W. for Susa.
On the latter headland lies the little town of <i>Kelibia</i>, the ancient
<i>Aspis</i> or <i>Clupea</i>, whose castle-hill is crowned with a lighthouse.
The flat coast of the <i>Gulf of Hammamet</i> (p. <a href='#Page_364'>364</a>) recedes from
view; beyond it, in the background, are the distant <i>Jebel Zaghouan</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_359'>359</a>), <i>Jebel Zeriba</i> (2412 ft.), and <i>Jebel Fadloun</i> (1306 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearing <b>Susa</b> (p. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a>), we have a pleasant view of the olive-clad
hills of the <i>Sahel</i>, while the town itself presents a most striking
picture with its great expanse of white houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the coast, where the low dunes conceal the salt-marshes
of the <i>Sebkha de Sahline</i>, we steer to the E.S.E. towards the <i>Pointe
de Monastir</i>, the S. limit of the bay of Hammamet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little town of <b>Monastir</b> (82 ft.; Hôt. de Paris, Hôt. de
France, both primitive; Brit. vice-cons., A. B. Geary; pop. 9000,
incl. 600 Europeans) lies superbly on the olive-clad headland. It
owes its name to a monastery, which in early Moorish times still
existed as the sole relic of the Roman seaport of <i>Ruspina</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the steamer we first sight the white pinnacled town-wall
and the numerous shrines outside of it. Then, as we pass between
the headland and the three islets off the coast (<i>Djezira Sidi el-Rhedamsi</i>
or <i>Ile Egdemsi</i>, etc.), appears the dilapidated Moorish
<i>Kasba</i> with the tower of <i>En-Nadour</i>. To the E. in very clear
weather we descry the lighthouse on the distant <i>Kuriat Islands</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a short stay in the <i>Bay of Monastir</i>, on the S. side of
the town, we steer to the S.E., past the <i>Dahar Cliffs</i> (on the left),
and across the bay; then, beyond the <i>Râs Dimas</i>, along the coast
to <b>Mehdia</b> (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>), where the steamer seldom stops long enough
to admit of our visiting the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next (generally at night) we pass <i>Râs Kapoudia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>), the
N. limit of the <i>Gulf of Gabes</i> (the ancient <i>Syrtis Minor</i>), where
the discrepancy between flow and ebb (6½ ft.) is greater than in
any other part of the Mediterranean. Avoiding the silted <i>Kerkenna
Passage</i>, the vessel steers round the <i>Kerkenna Islands</i> (<i>Ile Chergui</i>
and <i>Ile Gharbi</i>, the ancient <i>Cercina</i> and <i>Cercinitis</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer usually arrives at <b>Sfax</b> (by way of the harbour-canal,
p. <a href='#Page_381'>381</a>) early in the morning. Beyond Sfax the vessel skirts
the uninteresting coast as far as <i>Râs Tina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_383'>383</a>), and then steers
to the S.S.W. across the bay to <b>Gabes</b> (p. <a href='#Page_389'>389</a>), where it generally
allows time for a short visit to the oasis.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving Gabes we may in clear weather descry the <i>Monts des
Ksour</i> (p. <a href='#Page_390'>390</a>) bounding the horizon. We then steer to the E. to
the sandy N. coast of <b>Djerba</b> (p. <a href='#Page_393'>393</a>), and anchor in the open sea
off <i>Houmt-Souk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_393'>393</a>). The process of going ashore and returning
takes so long that it is hardly ever possible to visit the place.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>After losing sight of the lighthouse of <i>Râs Taguermess</i> (or
<i>Turgoeness</i>), the E. cape of Djerba, we steer for a long time to the
E.S.E., at some distance from the sandy coast with its salt-marshes,
where the <i>Râs Adjir</i> marks the frontier of Tripolitania.</p>

<p class='c011'>The monotonous sandy coast, with its numerous oases, with the
little port of <i>Sansur</i>, and the watch-tower of <i>Gergârish</i> (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>),
is scarcely visible till we are nearing <i>Tripoli</i>. The <i>Lighthouse</i>,
rising above the abraded terrace on the N.W. side of the town, and
the ruinous <i>Spanish Fort</i> (1510) at the end of the headland are
the chief landmarks. Numerous reefs make it difficult, and in a
N.W. gale sometimes impossible, for vessels to enter the harbour.</p>

by Jewish and Maltese children as well as Italian. There are three French
schools also.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Tripoli in Barbary</i> (Ital. <i>Tripoli di Barbería</i>, Fr. <i>Tripoli
de Barbarie</i> or <i>d’Afrique</i>, Arabic <i>Tarabulus el-Gharb</i>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Tripoli
of the West’, to distinguish it from the Syrian Tripoli), the
ancient <i>Oëa</i>, is the capital of the Turkish vilayet of <i>Tripolitania</i>,
presided over by the Vali or governor-general. The town lies in
32° 54′ N. lat. and 13° 10′ E. long., on a triangular peninsula, which
consists of quaternary dune-sandstone resting on tertiary limestone
rock. A series of rocky islets and reefs, 1¼ M. long, running out
from the peninsula, form a roomy but much silted harbour. The
mixture of nationalities converging at Tripoli, as one of the chief
portals to inland Africa, is unparallelled except in Egypt. Of the
46,000 inhab. two-thirds are Berbers (p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>), Arabs, Moors (p. <a href='#Page_171'>171</a>),
and Turks; there are 10,000 Jews, 2000 Maltese, 800 Italians, 150
Greeks (besides many Greek sponge-fishers in summer), 200 other
Europeans, and lastly some 2000 negroes, descendants of slaves
from the Sudan. Negroes are to be found also among the very
numerous officers of the garrison of 6000 men.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town with its white houses, its slender minarets of the
Turkish type, its green gardens and groups of palms, the reddish-yellow
dunes of drift-sand from the Sahara, and the deep-blue sea,
all bathed in dazzling sunshine, present a most fascinating picture.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> The three Phœnician seaports between the Syrtis Minor
and Major, <i>Leptis Magna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>), <i>Oëa</i>, and <i>Sabratha</i>, together called
<i>Tripolis</i> by the Sicilian Greeks, were even in the Punic age connected
by caravan routes with inland Africa and by a coast-road, 512 M. long,
with Carthage. After their annexation to the Roman province of <i>Africa</i>
on the fall of Jugurtha (p. <a href='#Page_321'>321</a>) the ‘three cities’ flourished anew. To
them, as also to Tacape (Gabes), the Garamantes, or Libyan (Berber)
inhabitants of Phazania (now Fezzan), brought from the Sudan ostrich-feathers,
gold-dust, ivory, ebony, elephants, and black slaves, to be exported
thence to Carthage, Rome, and the chief seaports of S. Europe.
This region yielded also large supplies of corn, while the productive
olive-trees were deemed the most abundant on the Mediterranean. To
the Roman emperors <i>Septimius Severus</i> (193–211) and <i>Alexander Severus</i>
(222–35), natives of this district, the three towns owed much improvement
and embellishment. The Punic language and the Greek, which was that
of the educated classes, were then still so prevalent that Alexander
Severus, for example, was unacquainted with Latin till his arrival in Rome.
Sept. Severus made Oëa the capital of his <i>Provincia Tripolitana</i>, and
when the artificial harbours of the two sister towns fell into decay Oëa
succeeded to their trade and their joint name.</p>

<p class='c022'>After the Vandal period (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) and after the domination of the
Byzantines, who succeeded only in 567 in Christianizing the Garamantes,
the repeated irruptions of the Arabs (p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>) brought ruin and misery to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the whole country. From 670 onwards, apart from the short periods of
occupation by the Normans (1140–59), the Spaniards (1510–30), and the
Maltese Knights (1530–51), Tripolitania remained for centuries under Arab
or Berber sway, sharing the fortunes of Tunisia (comp. p. <a href='#Page_322'>322</a>), while
from 1216 onwards the Genoese had a monopoly of the coast-trade of
Tripolitania and Barca. In 1551 the corsair Dragut (p. <a href='#Page_370'>370</a>), driven out
of Mehdia, founded a new Turkish tributary state at Tripoli. From that
time down to 1816 the inhabitants took an active part in the depredations
of the ‘Algerian pirates’, bringing down upon them the sanguinary reprisals
of an English fleet in 1663 and of French fleets in 1685 and 1728,
which caused the almost entire destruction of the town. In 1804 Tripoli
and in 1805 Derna (p. <a href='#Page_414'>414</a>) were stormed by the Americans. The native
dynasty of the <i>Karamanli</i>, founded in 1714, was overthrown by the Turks
in 1835, after which Tripoli became a usual place of exile for Turkish
civil and military offenders and again lapsed into decay. At length, in
1899, the partition of the inland regions between Great Britain and France
stimulated the Turks to renewed activity and defensive measures. In
spite, however, of these, and of the very favourable situation of the town,
the caravan trade with the interior is on the decline and the local industries
are inconsiderable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Old Town</span>, a pentagon, is still enclosed on four sides by
the mouldering Spanish <i>Town Wall</i>, 40 ft. high at places, built of
sandstone from Gergârish (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>), and consists of three different
quarters. Near the harbour, and behind the <i>Marina</i> (Pl. B, 1, 2)
skirting it from the Dogana or Custom House (Pl. B, 1) onwards,
lies the quarter of that name, inhabited chiefly by the Christians,
and therefore the least Oriental in appearance. To the W. is the
<i>Hárra</i> (<i>Kebîr</i>, the great, and <i>Serîr</i>, the little), the Jewish quarter,
with its crooked and dirty streets. The purely Mohammedan <i>S.E.
Quarter</i> contains the main business streets, which lead to the
outer markets and the new town (p. <a href='#Page_409'>409</a>). The principal streets
are paved and are lighted at night with petroleum lamps, but many
others, especially in the Jewish quarter, being unpaved in Oriental
fashion, are almost impassable after rain and pitch-dark at night.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the narrow Strada della Marina (Arabic Bâb Bahr, sea-gate),
leading from the Dogana and the fish-market to the S.W. to the
Jews’ quarter, rises on the right the <i>Roman Triumphal Arch</i>
(Pl. B, 1), built by the consul C. Orfitus in the reign of Antoninus
Pius (138–161) but in 163 rededicated to that emperor’s successors,
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus.</p>

<p class='c016'>The arch, 41 ft. broad and 33 ft. deep, has four fronts (‘quadrifrons’;
comp. pp. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>, 316), showing that it stood over cross-streets. Among the
sadly mutilated sculptures are still seen statues of Victory, figures of
animals, and trophies. The back, with the inscription, is half covered,
and the fourth side is almost entirely built over. The lower half is buried
in the ground. The interior is used as a shop. The vaulting of the passages
is lacunar. The central space is covered with a flat dome, rising
from an octagonal cornice.</p>

<p class='c009'>We next come to the <i>Gurji Mosque</i> (Pl. B, 1), with an octagonal
minaret, and to the main street of the <i>Hárra Kebîr</i> (see
above), with its numerous workshops, where curious gold and silver
trinkets are sold by weight.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>From the <i>British Consulate</i> (Pl. 5; B, 1) we follow the Church
Street to the S.E. to the Italian Gothic church of <i>Santa Maria
degli Angeli</i> (Pl. B, 2), completed in 1846, belonging to an Italian
Franciscan monastery. By leave of the superior we may ascend the
tower, whose gallery (141 ft.) is a fine point of view.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Piazza (Pl. B, 2; Arabic Mussâiya) near the church
the Strada del Consolato Italiano leads to the S. to the Sûk el-Harrâra
(Pl. B, A, 2, 3), the chief thoroughfare between the Marina
(p. <a href='#Page_408'>408</a>) and the W. gate, <i>Bâb el-Jedîd</i> (Pl. A, 3; ‘new gate’), opened
in 1860. This sûk contains the shops of the cloth and silk weavers
and several curious antiquated <i>Bakeries</i>, with millstones turned
by camels.</p>

<p class='c016'>A road from the W. gate leads to the W., past several wells (p. <a href='#Page_410'>410</a>),
to the (8 min.) extensive <i>Jewish Cemetery</i>; another, to the N., to the
ancient <i>Necropolis</i> (Pl. A, 2), on the abrupt coast (82 ft.), not far from
the town-wall, containing many rock-tombs and cisterns.—The <i>Greek</i> and
the <i>Catholic Cemeteries</i> (Pl. A, B, 1) lie between the Lazaretto and the
lighthouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The busiest streets in the S.E. quarter are the Zanga Sûk et-Turk
(Pl. B, 2, 3) and, diverging from it at the Piazza dell’Orologio,
the Sûk el-Khadra or Sûk Urba (Pl. B, C, 3). The tasteless three-storied
<i>Torre dell’ Orologio</i>, Arabic <i>Sâa</i> (Pl. B, 3), which tells
Turkish time, was built in 1870. In front of the Arab cafés here
auctions are held on Friday forenoons.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Sûks</span> (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>) consist here in part only of vaulted passages;
many have wooden roofs with vine-trellises. The wares are mostly
Tunisian or European, and therefore seldom worth buying here.
A side-entrance adjoins the <i>Jâma el-Bâsha</i> (Pl. C, 3), the chief
mosque.</p>

<p class='c011'>The massive pile of buildings by the sea, a few paces to the E. of
the clock-tower, is the <i>Serai</i> (Pl. C, 2, 3; Arabic Kasba), originally
the Spanish citadel. It now contains barracks, many courts, several
prisons (habbês), partly underground, and the government offices.
The terrace next the sea affords a fine view of the harbour and
towards the oasis.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the S. gates, Bâb el-Khandek and Bâb el-Menshia or el-Mnshîa
(Pl. C, 3; oasis gate), rises the <i>Fontana Maggiore</i>, an elegant
well-house in the Turkish rococo style. Near it is the <i>Circolo
Militare</i> (Pl. C, 3; p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>), a fashionable resort, especially when the
military band plays (Sun. and Frid., 5 or 8 p.m.). The pretty little
garden, whence we survey the Moslem cemetery (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>), contains
four fine antique statues in marble, all of them torsos from Leptis
Magna (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the S. gates lies the featureless <span class='sc'>New Town</span> (<i>Città
Nuova</i>), in which among other buildings are situated the <i>Town Hall</i>
(Beledîa; Pl. C, 3), the <i>Azizia</i> (Pl. C, D, 3, 4), erected under Abdul
Aziz as a residence for the commandant, the new <i>Vali’s Residence</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>(Pl. C, 4), and the <i>Technical School</i> (Pl. D, 4). The <i>Sûk el-Khobsa</i>
or bread-market (Pl. C, 3), with its fondouks (inns), is worth seeing
in the early morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sandy beach, nearly ¾ M. long, is the scene, early on
Tuesday mornings, of a great *<span class='sc'>Weekly Market</span> (<i>Sûk et-Tlett</i>;
Pl. D, E, 3, 4), attended also by camel caravans from the interior.
Among the many products of the country offered for sale here are
fruit and cereals from the oases (see below), olive-oil (Arabic zeit),
henna (see below), alfa or esparto, reed-mats, pottery, leather goods
(such as the girbas, water-skins in goat-leather for journeys in the
desert, made at Ghadâmes). It is a market also for pack-camels
(Arabic jemél), donkeys (hmâr), sheep, and goats.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the market are a barracks quarter (<i>Kishla</i>) and the
suburb of <i>Dahra</i>, inhabited by Turks, Arabs, and Maltese, with a
strange-looking mosque and a Catholic nunnery-orphanage. A little
to the S., on the road to Másri (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>), is a <i>Negro Village</i> with
conical reed-huts.—To the E. of the market, close to the sea, lies
the <i>Giardino Pubblico</i> (Pl. E, 3, 4; bands on Frid. and Sun.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Menshia</b> or <i>Mnshîa</i> (pop. about 14,000, mostly Berbers),
the coast-oasis of Tripoli, once far more extensive, stretches
7½ M., with a breadth of 1–2½ M., as far as the dunes bordering
the <i>Jefâra Steppe</i>. In spring it is one sea of blossom. To the
S. of the steppe rise the limestone hills fringing the <i>Sahara</i> (Shára,
desert), commonly called the <i>Jebél</i> (mountain; 1300–1650 ft. high).
The deep ravines, filled with considerable streams during the winter
rains (14 in. per annum at Tripoli, but considerably more in the
Jebél), continue to send down a supply of water underground even
during the dry season. This water is obtained from countless draw-wells
(sânia), bordered with white walls, and generally shaded by
tamarisks (Arabic âtel). Day and night oxen or donkeys toil at the
drawing of the water, which is then collected in reservoirs and
conducted thence to the fields.</p>

<p class='c016'>In spite of this imperfect mode of irrigation and the primitive wooden
agricultural implements used by the natives the excellent soil is wonderfully
productive. Beneath the fruit-trees of every variety, olive-trees,
mulberry-trees, and alcanna-shrubs (henna, Lawsonia inermis; p. <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>),
which thrive under the tall overshadowing date-palms, the soil still
gives sustenance to barley (Arabic shaîr), wheat (gammah), maize, lupins,
tobacco (dokhàn), madder, rose-geraniums, red pepper (filfil ahmar),
onions, tomatoes, spinach, beans, melons, etc. The excellent early potatoes
are sent to Europe under the name of ‘Malta potatoes’. The fields
and gardens are enclosed by mud-walls 3–7 ft. high, overgrown with Indian
figs (prickly pears; Opuntia Ficus indica; Arabic ‘hind’), which prevents
them from collapsing in wet weather. It is harvest all the year round.
From April to June almonds, apricots, and corn are gathered in, then in
July and August peaches (khûkh), from July to September figs and luscious
grapes, from October to December dates and olives, from November to
April excellent oranges, and at almost any season lemons. In autumn
the nomadic Arabs of the steppe pitch their dark goats’-hair tents (beit
shâar, house of hair) in the vacant fields in order to gather the fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>yellow dates. The dates of the coast are, however, inferior in flavour to
those of the Sahara oases and unsuitable for exportation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following <span class='sc'>Excursion</span> takes about 2 hrs. (best to drive or
ride; see p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>). From the Sûk el-Khobsa (p. <a href='#Page_410'>410</a>) the road leads
to the S.W., cutting through a Moslem cemetery destroyed by an
inundation in 1904, to (1¼ M.) <i>Bumeliâna</i>, where a pumping-station
supplies several public fountains in the town. It then runs
to the E. to (1 M.) <i>Másri</i>, with its large artillery and cavalry barracks,
where the dunes command a fine view of the steppe, visible in
clear weather as far as the distant Jebél. Turning to the S.E., and
passing the mud-built fort, <i>Gasr el-Hâni</i>, we come to (2½ M.) the
road leading to the N. to the (¾ M.) official house of the Sheikh of
the Menshia (<i>Hôsh esh-Skiûkh</i>; fine view towards the sea from the
balcony). About 1¼ M. to the N.E. are the <i>Sûk el-Jêma</i> (Friday
market) and the extremely dirty village of <i>Amrûs</i>, inhabited by
about 600 Jews, mostly smiths. Thence back to Tripoli 3 M.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the <i>Sherrashhet</i>, the road leading from Dahra (p. <a href='#Page_410'>410</a>) near the
coast, are several country-houses and (about 2 M.) the largest <i>Mohammedan
Cemetery</i>, containing two dilapidated domed tombs (of the Karamanli
dynasty, p. <a href='#Page_408'>408</a>), visible from Tripoli. Near it, close to the sea, is the
<i>Protestant Cemetery</i>, where we have a charming view of Tripoli. About
7½ M. farther, on the caravan-route to Lebida (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>), are the village of
<i>Mélaha</i> and the oasis of <i>Tajûra</i>, with its colonnaded mosque.</p>

<p class='c022'>The W. end of the Menshia is 1½ M. from the town. We may thence
cross the undulating steppe, past several mud-built forts, to the small
oasis of (4½ M.) <i>Gergârish</i>, with its old sandstone quarries and ruined
watch-tower (Gasr Jehalî, tower of the ignorant), originally Roman.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>From Tripoli the steamer proceeds to the N.N.E. to <b>Malta</b>
(p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>). Off the abrupt S. coast of the island, with its numerous
caves, lies the uninhabited rocky islet of <i>Filfola</i>, which forms a
target for the artillery practice of the British Mediterranean fleet
(p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>). Farther on we obtain a striking view of the barren E. coast,
with the bay of <i>Marsa Scirocco</i>, bounded by <i>Benhisa Point</i> and
<i>Delimara Point</i>. On a height rises the old <i>Fort St. Lucian</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>St. Thomas’s Bay</i>, with the old castle of <i>St. Thomas</i>
and the bay of <i>Marsa Scala</i>, the steamer rounds the <i>Ponta tal
Zonkor</i>, the N.E. point of the island, and soon reaches the entrance
to the <i>Grand Harbour</i> of <i>Valletta</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_399'>399</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Voyage to Syracuse</span> is performed at night. We steer to
the N.N.E. towards <i>Cape Passero</i> (the ancient <i>Promontorium
Pachynum</i>), the fissured headland at the S.E. point of <i>Sicily</i>,
with its lighthouse and two small harbours (<i>Porto d’Ulisse</i> and
<i>Porto Palo</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, on the E. coast of Sicily, stands forth the <i>Penisola della
Maddalena</i> (177 ft.), once a coast-island but now joined to the
main island by the deposits of the <i>Ciani</i> and <i>Anapo</i>. It ends in
the <i>Capo Murro di Porco</i>, with a lighthouse on the top.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>65. From Tripoli to Alexandria viâ Benghazi and Derna.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Steamboats</span> (agents at Tripoli, see p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>; at Alexandria, see p. <a href='#Page_432'>432</a>).
<b>1.</b> <i>German Levant Line</i> (cargo-boats), three times monthly (80 marks).—<b>2.</b>
Steamers of the <i>Banco di Roma</i> (p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>) fortnightly viâ Malta, Benghazi,
Derna, and Solum.—Between Tripoli, Lebida (occasionally), Mesurata,
Benghazi, and Derna there plies a fortnightly steamer of the Società
Nazionale (comp. R. 66).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Tripoli</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>. Skirting the flat, sandy coast, with its
numerous oases, including that of <i>Tajûra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>), we pass the
small <i>Râs Sotara</i>, <i>Râs el-Hamra</i> (‘red cape’), and <i>Râs Ligata</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the fertile undulating plain to the E. of the small port of
<i>Ligata</i> (lighthouse; sailing-boat from Tripoli in about 7 hrs. if
the wind is favourable) lies <i>Lebida</i>, <i>Lebda</i>, or <i>Khoms</i> (pop. 3500;
Brit. vice-cons.), in its oasis, a poor little seaport (for alfa) with
open roads, relics of old fortifications, and an Italian school.</p>

<p class='c016'>About 2 M. to the S.E. of Lebida lies the site of <b>Leptis Magna</b>,
which fell into decay after the first irruption of the Arabs. In ancient
times it was one of the richest trading towns in N. Africa. It was the
starting-point of the coast-road to Carthage (see p. <a href='#Page_407'>407</a>) and also of the
Limes Tripolitanus, the Roman frontier-wall, which down to the conquest
of the Garamantes (p. <a href='#Page_407'>407</a>) and the Gætuli in the 2nd and 3rd cent. A.D.
protected the province of Africa against the Sahara tribes. The ancient
harbour, with its massive quays, at the mouth of the <i>Kinyps</i>, which
was a copious stream in the Roman age (now a scanty brook, the <i>Oued
Lebda</i>), is completely choked with sand. The once famous oasis and the
grand ruins of the time of Septimius Severus (p. <a href='#Page_407'>407</a>) also, except the
triumphal arch (comp. pp. <a href='#Page_315'>315</a>, 316), are almost entirely buried in sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the rocky coast, which here endangers navigation, we next
pass the <i>Râs et-Tabia</i>, adjoined by the little port of <i>Marsa
Ugra</i>, and then, situated in the oasis near the <i>Râs es-Sahal</i>,
<i>Slîten</i> or <i>Zelythen</i> (pop. 7000), a seaport for alfa. Beyond the
<i>Râs el-Ihûdi</i> we sight <i>Cape Mesurata</i>, the ancient <i>Promontorium
Trikeron</i> (‘triple horn’) or <i>Cephalus</i>, a striking landmark.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small port of <b>Mesurata</b> or <i>Misrâta</i> (pop. 3000), in its
little oasis of palms, fruit, and olives, is noted for its carpets and
woven stuffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the coast we now steer to the E. across the <i>Syrtis
Major</i>, or <i>Gulf of Sidra</i>, the largest on the N. African seaboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town of <b>Benghazi</b> or <i>Bengâsi</i> (Albergo Maffei, near the
harbour, Italian; Brit. consul, J. F. Jones; pop. 20,000, incl. 1200
Europeans, mostly Maltese and Greeks, and 2500 Jews; garrison
3000) is the capital of the Turkish province (mutessariflik) of
<i>Benghazi</i> or <i>Barca</i>, which was separated from Tripolitania in
1869. Its dazzling white houses extend beyond the isthmus of the
<i>Sebkha</i> or salt-lake (with its large evaporating grounds) and over
the broad corn-growing coast-plain bordering the plateau of Merj
(p. <a href='#Page_414'>414</a>). The large <i>Gasar</i> or castle, now the seat of the governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>(mutessarif), with barracks, together with the lighthouse and a
windmill, form the chief landmarks as we make for the harbour.</p>

<p class='c011'>The harbour, much silted up and very imperfectly protected
by an unfinished breakwater, is sometimes rendered inaccessible
for months in winter by the prevailing W. gales. The steamers
have to lie to, under steam, some 3 M. off the coast, and passengers
are landed in lighters or in rowing-boats.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief sight is the <i>Market Quarter</i>, where caravans from
the interior are sometimes met with. The minarets, as at Tripoli,
are in the Turkish style. The European colony is mainly Maltese,
Greek, and Italian. The <i>Italian School</i> is attended chiefly by
Jewish children. A branch of the <i>Banco di Roma</i> (p. <a href='#Page_406'>406</a>) and
an <i>Italian Post Office</i> have been recently established.—To the E.
of the town is a beautiful <i>Palm Grove</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the N.E. of Benghazi lie the ruins of <i>Euhesperidae</i>, or <i>Berenice</i>, as
the town was called after the wife of Ptolemy III. Euhesperidæ, famed
in Greek myth for the gardens of the Hesperides, was the westmost seaport-town
of Barca, the ancient <b>Cyrenaica</b>, a fissured hill-region rising in terraces
from the sea, which was colonized in the 7th cent. B.C. by Greeks,
mostly Dorians from Thera (p. <a href='#Page_417'>417</a>) and Crete (p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>). From its loftily
situated capital <i>Cyrene</i> (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>), one of the richest and most brilliant
cities in the Greek world, Greek culture spread rapidly over the whole
coast-region, where the numerous seaports acquired also great wealth
through the caravan-traffic with the interior. For a time (about 400–330 B.C.)
the Cyrenians succeeded in repelling the attacks of the Carthaginians
with their mighty fleet, but in 322 they succumbed to Ptolemy I. (p. <a href='#Page_433'>433</a>),
who united the different parts of the district under the name of <i>Pentapolis</i>
(‘five cities’). In 96 B.C. this region along with the Marmarica
(p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>) fell into the hands of the Romans, and it was united by Augustus
with Crete as a Roman province. In the great revolt of the numerous
Jews who had settled in Egypt and Barca in the Ptolemaic age, 200,000
Greeks and Romans are said to have perished in Trajan’s reign. This
terrible disaster was followed by the irruption of Berber tribes and of
Arab marauders, and later (after 1551) by the misgovernment of the
Turks. The ruin of the country was completed by a gradual subsidence
of the coast which seriously prejudiced navigation. Though well supplied
with rain, extremely fertile, and not too hot in summer, this region is
now but thinly peopled (about 500,000), and the only towns of any size are
Benghazi, Merj (p. <a href='#Page_414'>414</a>), and Derna (p. <a href='#Page_414'>414</a>). The highlands are occupied
by hordes of nomadic Arabs, who often defy the Turkish authorities,
and who are largely under the influence of the fanatical brotherhood
of the Senussîyeh. The convents of the sect serve also as caravanserais.
European goods are conveyed by the caravan-route to Kufra, the headquarters
of the sect, and thence to equatorial Africa. Fire-arms are
frequently smuggled into the country, especially from Greece. The chief
exports are cattle (to Malta, Syracuse, etc.), goatskins, barley (to England),
wool (to Marseilles and Genoa), and butter (to Constantinople).
Large flocks of sheep are driven overland into Egypt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Benghazi the steamer rounds <i>Râs Adrian</i>; whose name
recalls the town of <i>Adrianopolis</i> founded by Hadrian. On a height,
farther on, appears <i>Tokra</i>, a poor village near the ruins of the
Greek twin-towns of <i>Tauchira</i> (<i>Teuchira</i>) and <i>Arsinoë</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next place on the coast, at the foot of a chain of high hills
overgrown with brushwood, is <i>Tolmeita</i> (Ital. <i>Tolemáide</i>), the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span><i>Ptolemais</i> or <i>Tolometta</i>, now the site of imposing *Ruins
(Greek, Roman, and early-Christian). The Greek Kothon was the
harbour of <b>Barca</b>, a thriving Greek colony on the margin of the
plateau, about 15 M. inland, founded about 540 B.C. and temporarily
destroyed by the Persians in 510. The town was still a place of some
importance in the middle ages as a military station and a resting-place
for Mecca pilgrims, but now, under the name of <i>Merj</i> or
<i>Medinet el-Merj</i>, which has been given to the whole province,
it has become a poor little Turkish garrison-town, inhabited by
Arabs and Jews. No trace of its ruins is left.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the rocky islet of <i>Sarat</i> and <i>Râs el-Hamâma</i>, the
ancient cape <i>Phycus</i>, we reach the bold <i>Râs Sem</i>, the northmost
point of Barca, about 10 M. to the N.W. of Cyrene (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>In a small plain on the coast, between the Râs Sem and <i>Râs
el-Hilil</i> (the ancient <i>Naustathmus</i>), lies the poor seaport of <i>Marsa
Susa</i>, recently colonized by Moslems from Crete. Near it are the
ruins of <i>Apollonia</i> (later <i>Sozopolis</i>), once the harbour of Cyrene,
but destroyed by the silting up of the coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Marsa Susa a mule-track ascends to the S.W., through
valleys with luxuriant vegetation and venerable olive-groves, past
several ancient rock-hewn <i>Granaries</i>, and past a *<i>Necropolis</i> with
countless rock-tombs, to (3–4 hrs.) the ruins of <b>Cyrene</b> (2002 ft.;
now <i>Krennah</i> or <i>Gurena</i>), lying on the edge of a lofty plateau,
with fine views all around. This was the capital of the Cyrenaica,
founded near the fountain of Cyra about 620 B.C., but already
spoken of in the 4th cent. A.D. as ‘urbs deserta’. The ruins have
not yet been scientifically explored, but there are traces of streets,
and, beneath a mantle of dense vegetation, scanty remains of the
acropolis, the temples, and a Roman circus. Near them is a convent
of the Senussîyeh, to which unbelievers are not admitted.</p>

<p class='c016'>About 10 M. to the S.E. of Marsa Susa, on the caravan-route to
Guba (or Mara), once lay the town of <i>Ghermes</i>, whose *Ruins are the
best preserved in the Cyrenaica (town-wall, forum, stadium, etc.).</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the bay of <i>Marsa el-Hilil</i> the coast is again rocky.
Near a beautiful, richly wooded ravine are the ruins of <i>Erythrum</i>.
We next steer past <i>Râs Turba</i> and then round the little <i>Tsor
Kersa Islands</i> and the <i>Râs Boasa</i> (lighthouse).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Derna</b> (pop. 4000), the <i>Darnis</i> or <i>Darnae</i> of antiquity, a
small seaport to the E. of the headland, but entirely destitute of a
harbour, is now the chief trading town in E. Cyrenaica. Vessels
anchor in the open sea, over a mile from the landing-place. Near
the Turkish fort and the custom-house are remains of American
fortifications (comp. p. <a href='#Page_408'>408</a>) and a wireless telegraph-station.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town itself lies on a plateau in the finest *<i>Coast Oasis</i> of
Barca (yielding dates, figs, almonds, tobacco, etc.). In the principal
square, near which the camel-caravans from the interior encamp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>is the unpretending residence of the Turkish kaimakam. The shops
in the busy market-street are mostly owned by Arabs and Greeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the <i>Râs et-Tîn</i> (Gr. <i>Chersonesos</i>), the coast recedes
far to the S. The <i>Gulf of Bomba</i>, with its rocky islands, here
forms a large natural harbour, open towards the E. only. Beyond
<i>Menelaus Island</i> (now <i>Susra Mesrâta</i>) once lay the <i>Portus Menelai</i>.
The <i>Platea Island</i> near it received from Thera, about 640 B.C.,
the first Greek colony in the Cyrenaica.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next skirt the <i>Marmarica</i>; the coast-region between the
gulfs of Bomba and <i>Solum</i>. In the deep-set bay of <i>Tobruk</i> (the
ancient <i>Antipyrgos</i>) it possesses the best natural harbour between
Bizerta and Alexandria, frequented chiefly by sponge-fishers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The featureless and inconspicuous coast of <i>Egypt</i> is bounded
by the low white dunes near the borders of the Libyan desert.
Lastly we steer across the broad so-called <i>Arabian Gulf</i>, between
the <i>Râs ed-Dabba</i> and the <i>Nile Delta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_418'>418</a>), and enter the harbour
of <i>Alexandria</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_418'>418</a>).</p>

<h3 class='c020'>66. From Tripoli to Constantinople viâ Derna and Crete.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Between Tripoli and Constantinople there is a fortnightly service by
the <i>Società Nazionale</i> (Line VIII: Catania, Syracuse, Benghazi, Constantinople;
comp. R. 64). Dep. from Tripoli every second Mon. aft., from
Mesurata Tues. morn., from Benghazi Thurs., from Derna Frid. noon,

of the Austrian Lloyd, and of Line X (p. <a href='#Page_493'>493</a>) of the Società Nazionale.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the voyage from Tripoli to <i>Derna</i>, see R. 65. The steamer
next touches at <b>Crete</b> (Gr. <i>Krētē</i>, Turk. <i>Kirid</i>, Ital. <i>Candia</i>), the
fourth-largest island in the Mediterranean (5402 sq. M.; 303,550
inhab.), formerly Turkish, but nominally independent since 1908.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearing the island we first sight the <i>Aspra Vuná</i> (<i>Madaraes
Mts.</i>, 7907 ft.), generally snow-clad, the ancient <i>Leuka Orē</i> (White
Mts.). The vessel steers round <i>Cape Krio</i>, the S.W. point of Crete,
and <i>Cape Busa</i>, the N.W. point, and passes the island of <i>Grabusa</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next proceed to the E.N.E., past <i>Kisamo Bay</i> and <i>Cape
Spada</i> (<i>Psakon</i>), the N. point of the island. Beyond the cape
opens the broad <i>Bay of Canea</i> (Gr. <i>Chanía</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>In favourable weather the steamer anchors in the open roads
of <b>Canea</b> (Hôt. de France, pens. 8–10 fr.; Hôt.-Restaur. Bristol,
pens. 5–8 fr.; at both it is advisable to ask charges; Brit. cons.-gen.,
R. Peel; pop. 21,000), the capital of Crete, on the site of <i>Kydonia</i>.
The remains of the Venetian fortifications are interesting. Fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>view from the lofty reservoir of the waterworks. Most of the consuls
reside at <i>Chalepa</i>, the E. suburb.</p>

<p class='c011'>In stormy weather the steamers round the broad headland of
<i>Akrotiri</i> (once <i>Kyamon</i>) and anchor in <i>Suda Bay</i>, the only good
harbour in the island. (Road to Canea.)</p>

<p class='c011'>After leaving Canea and passing <i>Cape Drépano</i> we have a
pleasant view of <i>Harmyro Bay</i> and <i>Rethymno</i>, Ital. <i>Rétimo</i>
(pop. 9300), the ancient <i>Rhithymna</i>, now the third-largest town
in Crete. In the heart of the island tower the <i>Psiloriti Mts.</i>, the
ancient <i>Ida</i>, often snow-clad, culminating in the <i>Stavros</i> (8065 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on we pass <i>Cape Stavros</i>, an important landmark. We
then steer to the S.E., between <i>Cape Panaghia</i> and the barren
island of <i>Dia</i>, Ital. <i>Standia</i> (870 ft.), where vessels seek refuge
from northerly storms, into <i>Candia Bay</i> and anchor in the roads
a little off the quay (lighthouse).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Candia</b> (Hotels, both near the landing-place: Cnossos, pens.
9–15 fr., with restaurant; Angleterre, rooms only, unpretending;
advisable to ask charges at both; Brit. vice-cons., A. Calocherino;
pop. 22,480), Gr. <i>Herákleion</i>, formerly <i>Megalókastron</i>, the seat
of the Metropolitan of Crete, is said to have been founded by the
Moors on the site of Herakleion, the port of Knossos. Here also
the fortifications were built by the Venetians, and were bravely
defended by their admiral Franc. Morosini against the Turks for
three years until he had to capitulate in 1669.</p>

<p class='c011'>We walk from the landing-place through the main street and
past a handsome Venetian palace to the chief square, with the
<i>Morosini Fountain</i>. Straight on we come, at the E. end of the
town, to an open space, at the N.E. angle of which is the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<i>Museum</i>, containing the splendid antiquities excavated at
Knossos and elsewhere, illustrating the peculiar development of
art in Crete at its prime. The oldest objects belong to the so-called
island culture (3rd millenary B.C.) of the bronze period, or
early and middle Minoan periods, as they are now called after
Minos the legendary king of Crete. To the bronze age belong also
the pre-Hellenic antiquities, those namely of the so-called Mycenæan
or late Minoan period (middle of 2nd millenary B.C.), which are
hardly surpassed by the creations of Greece at its zenith. Particular
notice should be taken of the wall-paintings, fragments of a
procession, stone vases with reliefs, ivory statuettes of bull-baiters,
and the two fayence figures of a goddess grasping a snake.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the old S. gate of Candia a road (horse 3–4 fr.) leads in
less than an hour to the site of <i>Knossos</i>, the ancient capital of the
island. The *<i>King’s Palace</i>, excavated here since 1898 by Mr.
Arthur Evans, dates from the second or middle Minoan period, but
was already half burned down in the Mycenæan period.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer next crosses the <i>Cretan Sea</i>, to the N.N.E., to two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>islands of the <i>Cyclades</i> (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>): <i>Anaphe</i> (1349 ft.) and <i>Santorin</i>
or <i>Thira</i> (1857 ft.), the ancient <i>Thera</i>. Close to <i>Cape Oia</i> (lighthouse)
on the beautiful island of Santorin, which is the relic of an
old crater (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>), are seen the ruins of <i>Thera</i>, the ancient capital.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, on the left, we sight the island of <i>Iós</i> or <i>Niós</i> (2408 ft.).
We then pass through the strait between <i>Amorgós</i> (1233 ft.; lighthouse),
the eastmost island of the kingdom of Greece, and the small
island group of <i>Eremonisia</i>, flanking Naxos on the S.E. side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The high mountains of <i>Naxos</i> (3289 ft.), the largest of the
Cyclades, remain in sight long after we have passed the islet of
<i>Donusa</i> (1600 ft.). The islands of <i>Delos</i>, once the religious and
economic centre of the Cyclades, and <i>Mykonos</i> (1194 ft.) are only
visible in the far distance in very clear weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ship presently nears the W. coast of <i>Nikaria</i> (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>), an
island belonging to the <i>S. Sporades</i> (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>), and then (as do also
the steamers from the Levant) passes through the <i>Strait of Chios</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>) and across the <i>Gulf of Smyrna</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_530'>530</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>Leaving the Straits of Messina, we steer across the <i>Ionian Sea</i>,
to the E.S.E., in a direct line for Egypt. <i>Mt. Ætna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>) remains
long in sight. For two days we lose sight of land. The mountains
of Crete (p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>) are visible on the voyage to Alexandria only in
perfectly clear weather; but on the voyage to Port Said we pass
within a few miles of Crete and near the island of <i>Gavdos</i>, Ital.
<i>Gozo</i> (1063 ft.; lighthouse), which flanks Crete on the S.W.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the <span class='sc'>Alexandria Voyage</span>, nearing land, we overlook the
long isthmus of <i>Lake Mareotis</i> (p. <a href='#Page_432'>432</a>), from the sand-hill near
<i>Abusîr</i>, on the E. shore of the <i>Arabian Gulf</i> (p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>), to <i>Ramleh</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_436'>436</a>) and <i>Fort Abukîr</i> on the W. shore of that gulf. The chief

Cafarelli</i> or <i>Napoléon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We pass through the strait of <i>Boghaz</i>, amidst the chain of cliffs
between Râs et-Tîn and the fortified <i>Marabout Island</i>, and sight
the two lighthouses of <i>El-Meks</i> in succession. Lastly we steer
through the outer harbour, with its breakwater, and past the <i>New</i>
or <i>Gabbari Mole</i> (Môle aux Charbons), 1000 yds. long, into the
inner harbour of <i>Alexandria</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>On the <span class='sc'>Port Said Voyage</span> the flat coast of Egypt is generally
approached at night. We first sight the lights of <i>Damietta</i>, on the
E. bank of the Damietta branch of the <i>Nile</i>, the ancient <i>Phatnitic
Arm</i>. This and the Rosetta arm are now the only mouths of the
river, which had seven in ancient times.</p>

<p class='c011'>A conspicuous landmark is <i>Fort Jemil</i>, between the former

<p class='c009'><i>Venice</i>, Ital. <i>Venezia</i>, once the most brilliant commercial city
in the world, now a provincial capital, with 148,500 inhab., of whom
one quarter are practically paupers, is a commercial and naval
port. It lies 2½ M. from the mainland in the lagoons, a shallow
bay 25 M. long by 9½ M. broad, separated from the Adriatic by
narrow sandy strips of land (<i>lidi</i>). The city is built on piles, on
117 islets, and is intersected by over 150 canals, which are crossed
by 378 bridges. The interior of the town consists of a labyrinth
of narrow streets and lanes, some of them scarcely 5 ft. wide. The
centre of traffic is the <i>Piazza San Marco</i> (‘la Piazza’), with the
adjacent <i>Piazzetta</i>. The other open spaces are called <i>campi</i> or
<i>campielli</i>. The local name for a street is <i>calle</i> or <i>salizzada</i>, and
for a narrow canal <i>rio</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tribe of the <i>Veneti</i>, the ancient inhabitants of N.E.Italy, were
of Illyrian race, but became Romanized in the 3rd cent. B. C. The havoc
committed on the mainland by the barbarian Huns compelled the inhabitants
of the coast to seek refuge in the islands of the lagoons, where
in 697 they formed the Venetian League, headed by a doge (<i>dux</i>). In
811 <i>Rivoalto</i> (now Venice) became their capital. Aided by its close
connection with the Byzantine Empire (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>), the town rose to be a
rival of Genoa in its important traffic between East and West. In its
art also Venice was under Oriental influence throughout the middle ages.
After the conquest of Constantinople by the great doge <i>Enrico Dandolo</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>in 1204, the lion of St. Mark laid his mighty talons on the coasts and
islands of Greece and Asia Minor. On the Italian continent also the
republic gradually extended its conquests to Bergamo.</p>

<p class='c022'>The 15th cent. saw the zenith of the republic’s glory, when her fleet
commanded the whole of the E. Mediterranean. But after their capture
of Constantinople in 1453 the Turks began to menace the Venetian
supremacy. The discovery of America and of the new sea-routes to
India carried the world’s traffic into new channels, while her continental
possessions involved her in the wars between the rival powers of France,
Austria, and Spain. Her protracted conflicts with the Turks led in 1718
to the final loss of all her Oriental possessions, and in 1798 her political
independence was destroyed by the French. From 1814 to 1866 Venice
belonged to Austria, and since 1866 has formed a part of the kingdom
of Italy, under whose auspices her trade has somewhat revived.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<b>Canal Grande</b> or <i>Canalazzo</i>, the main artery of Venice,
intersects the city from the <i>Railway Station</i> (Pl. C, D, 3) to the
harbour (<i>Canale</i> or <i>Bacino di San Marco</i>, Pl. G-K, 6, 7), from
N.W. to S.E., and resembles an inverted <i>S</i> in shape. The voyage
through it by steamer (p. <a href='#Page_419'>419</a>; 25 min.) or by gondola (p. <a href='#Page_419'>419</a>;
1 hr., preferable) conveys a most striking impression of the magnificence
of mediæval Venice. The canal is bordered with fine old guild-houses,
sumptuous churches, and stately palaces of the 12–18th
cent., and each of its bends reveals a new and picturesque vista.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Molo, or from one of the steamboat-piers (p. <a href='#Page_419'>419</a>) of
San Marco (Pl. G, 6) or San Zaccaria (Pl. H, 5), we next visit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>**<b>Piazza di San Marco</b> (Pl. G, 5), the centre of the traffic of the
city. Even now this far-famed piazza (182 yds. long, 100 yds. wide
at the E. end, 61 at the W. end; paved with slabs of trachyte and
marble) conveys an admirable idea of the ancient glory of Venice.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. and S. sides of the piazza rise the <span class='sc'>Procuratíe</span>, once
the residences of the nine procurators or highest officials of the
republic. The <i>Procuratíe Vecchie</i>, on the N. side, were erected
in 1480–1517. The <i>Procuratíe Nuove</i>, now used along with the
adjacent old Library (see below) as a royal palace, were begun by
Vinc. Scamozzi in 1584. The <i>Atrio</i> or <i>Nuova Fábbrica</i>, on the
W. side, dates only from 1810. The groundfloors of these buildings,
flanked with arcades, are now occupied by cafés (p. <a href='#Page_419'>419</a>) and shops.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old <span class='sc'>Campanile di San Marco</span>, at the corner of the Old
Library, collapsed in 1902, but has been rebuilt. The top of the
tower (adm. 15 c.) commands a fine and extensive *View. The
<i>Torre dell’ Orologio</i>, a clock-tower built in 1496–9, adjoining the
Old Procuratie, forms the entrance to the <i>Mercería</i> (p. <a href='#Page_421'>421</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The church of **<b>San Marco</b> (Pl. H, 5), which is said to contain
the bones of St. Mark, was begun in 830, rebuilt after a fire in
976, and restored after the middle of the 11th cent. in the Byzantine
style. The ground-plan (83½ yds. long, 56¾ yds. broad in front)
is in the form of a Greek cross (with equal arms), crowned with
five domes. The front arm of the cross is flanked with a colonnade.
Outside and inside the church is adorned with over five hundred
marble columns, mostly Oriental, and with mosaics, chiefly of the
10–16th centuries. The Gothic additions to the façade (15th cent.)
enhance its fantastic charm. Over the main portal are four antique
bronze-gilt horses from Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span> is wonderfully impressive. The beauty of the outlines
and the magnificence of the decoration are equally striking. The priceless
<i>Pala d’Oro</i>, which forms the altar-piece, from Constantinople (1105), is
shown on week-days (11–2; ticket, 50 c., admits also to the <i>Tesoro</i> in
the right transept, 11–2).</p>

<p class='c009'>Adjoining the Piazza of St. Mark, on the side next the lagoon,
is the *<b>Piazzetta</b> (Pl. H, 5, 6). The *<i>Librería Vecchia</i>, or old
library, now part of the royal palace (see above), by Jac. Sansovino
(1536–53), is one of the most beautiful secular buildings in Italy.
The adjacent <i>Zecca</i> (mint) now contains the famous library of
San Marco. On the opposite (E.) side of the square rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Doges’ Palace</b> (<i>Palazzo Ducale</i>; Pl. H, 5), which is said
to have been founded in 814 as the residence of the first doge. It
was rebuilt after the fires of 976 and 1105, and has since been
repeatedly restored and altered. The Gothic exterior is flanked
with two superb arcades with pointed arches; the W. front dates
from 1423–8; the S. front, next the lagoon, is of the 14th century.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Porta della Carta</i>, the late-Gothic chief portal, next to
the church, leads into the quadrangle of the palace, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>façades, though still partly Gothic, show the influence of the new
Renaissance style. In the interior (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_420'>420</a>) we visit the
central and upper floors, containing the state-apartments which were
redecorated after the fires of 1574 and 1577, a brilliant example
of the Venetian late-Renaissance and rococo art. The countless pictures
by Titian, Paolo Veronese, Jac. Tintoretto, and other masters,
proclaim the ancient glory of Venice. (Guide unnecessary. Catalogues
for public use on week-days.) The groundfloor contains the
<i>Archaeological Museum</i> (antiques, Renaissance sculptures, etc.).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the E. end of the Molo (p. <a href='#Page_422'>422</a>) the <i>Ponte della Paglia</i>
(Pl. H, 5, 6), which crosses the <i>Rio di Palazzo</i>, affords a good view
of the ‘Bridge of Sighs’ (<i>Ponte dei Sospiri</i>; Pl. H, 5), specially
interesting to readers of Childe Harold. The latter bridge connects
the Doges’ Palace with the <i>Prigioni di San Marco</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The contiguous <b>Riva degli Schiavoni</b> (Pl. H, I, 5; ‘quay of
the Slavonians’) forms the sunniest promenade in the town. To the
left, nearly opposite the <i>Monument of Victor Emmanuel II.</i>, a
narrow lane leads to the church of <i>San Zaccaria</i> (Pl. H, I, 5;
adm. in the afternoon 50 c.), built in 1458–1515. Over the second
altar on the left is a Madonna by Giov. Bellini (1505).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the W. of the church is Campo San Provolo. The
street of that name to the right, the first bridge to the left, and
then the Calle Corte Rotta and the Ruga Giuffa (Pl. H, 5) lead to
<i>Santa Maria Formosa</i> (Pl. H, 4; knock at W. portal; gratuity
25–30 c.), with the famous *St. Barbara by Palma Vecchio.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Campo Santa Maria Formosa we follow the Calle Lunga
to the E., and near the end of it the Calle Bragadin to the left (N.)
to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, with the *<i>Monument of Colleoni</i>
(Venetian condottiere, d. 1475), the grandest equestrian statue
of the Italian Renaissance, by the Florentine Andrea Verrocchio.</p>

<p class='c011'>The church of *<i>Santi Giovanni e Paolo</i> (Pl. H, 4; adm. see
p. <a href='#Page_420'>420</a>), once the church of the Dominicans and the burial-church
of the doges, erected in the Gothic style in 1330–90, is quite a
museum of Venetian sculpture. The finest monument is that of
Andrea Vendramin (d. 1478; in the choir, on the left), by Tullio
and Ant. Lombardi and Al. Leopardi.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the S. side of the <i>Canale di San Marco</i> (p. <a href='#Page_421'>421</a>), reached by ferry
from the Molo (‘traghetto’, 1–2 pers. 15, 3–4 pers. 20, 5–6 pers. 30 c.), or
more quickly by steamer from the Riva degli Schiavoni (see p. <a href='#Page_419'>419</a>), are the
island and the Benedictine church of <b>San Giorgio Maggiore</b> (Pl. H, 7;
if closed, ring on the right), built by Palladio (1565) and Ant. Palliari.
The <i>Campanile</i>, 197 ft. high (ascent to the left of the choir; easy wooden
stairs), offers a superb **View of the city, the lagoons, and the sea,
embracing in clear weather the Alpine chain far away to the N. (finest
in the early morning or just before sunset).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Trieste</i> (pop. 221,000, Italians, Slovenians, and Germans; in
1758 about 6400 only), the Roman <i>Tergeste</i>, the chief seaport of
Austria and in the E. Mediterranean, lies on the E. shore of the
<i>Bay of Trieste</i>, at the head of the Adriatic and at the foot of the
<i>Karst</i> or <i>Carso Plateau</i> (1945 ft.), which is often visited by N.E.
gales (Bora). Having become the heiress of Venice Trieste was a
free harbour from 1719 to 1891; in 1833 it became the seat of the
<i>Austrian Lloyd</i>, the oldest and one of the greatest of the steamboat
companies in the Mediterranean. The harbour is entered by
ca. 12,000 vessels annually (imports 573, exports 508 million
florins). The new Tauern Railway, completed in 1909, the direct
route to the Baths of Gastein, the Tyrol, and thence to Germany, is
expected to give a new impulse to the trade of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Harbour</b> comprises the <i>Porto Vecchio</i> (Pl. A, B, 4), sheltered
by the <i>Molo Santa Teresa</i> (Pl. A, 5; lighthouse) of 1756,
the <i>Porto Nuovo</i> (Pl. A, 1–3), with its four moles and a breakwater
1186 yds. long, constructed in 1867–83, and the <i>Porto Nuovo di
Sant’ Andrea</i> or <i>Francesco Giuseppe Primo</i> (Pl. A, B, 7). The
last, in the <i>Bay of Muggia</i>, was completed in 1910. Between the
Porto Nuovo and Porto Vecchio is the <i>Canal Grande</i> (Pl. C, 4),
completed in 1756, for small vessels only.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the old harbour are the two busiest squares in the town,
the <span class='sc'>Piazza Grande</span> (Pl. B, C, 4) and the <span class='sc'>Piazza della Borsa</span>. In the
Piazza Grande are a marble <i>Statue of Charles VI.</i> and the <i>Maria
Teresa Fountain</i> (1751). On its E. side rises the <i>Municipio</i> or
town-hall (Pl. C, 4). Next to the sea are pleasure-grounds; at the S.
end of these is the <i>Lloyd Palace</i> (Pl. B, 4); at the N. end is the
<i>Luogotenenza</i> (or governor’s residence; Pl. 7, C, 4).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of the Piazza Grande are the <i>Theatre</i> (Teatro Comunale
Giuseppe Verdi, Pl. C, 4) and the <i>Tergesteo</i> (Pl. 13; C, 4), the
new exchange, built in 1852. The <i>Borsa</i>, or old exchange (Pl. C, 4),
is now the seat of the chamber of commerce.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Via del Corso</span> (Pl. C, D, 4), the main street of Trieste,
running to the E. from the Piazza della Borsa, separates the new
town from the streets of the old town, which ascend the castle-hill.
The old <i>Castello</i> (Pl. D, 5) now contains the barracks. Fine views
are obtained from the terraces of the <i>Convento dei Cappuccini</i>
(Pl. D, 4, 5) and of the <span class='sc'>Cathedral</span> (<i>Basilica San Giusto</i>; Pl. 3, D, 5;
closed 12–3), which is composed of three early-Christian churches
(6th cent.), united in the 14th century.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the cathedral and the Piazza Grande are the open-air
<i>Museo Lapidario</i> (Pl. 9; C, 5), Via della Cattedrale 9, and the
<i>Arco di Riccardo</i> (Pl. 1a; C, 5), the remains of a Roman arch.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>In the Piazza Lipsia, to the S.W. of the Piazza Grande, rises
the <i>Commercial and Nautical Academy</i> (Pl. 1; B, 5), containing
the <i>Museo Civico</i> of natural history and antiquities. Near it is
the Piazza Giuseppina (Pl. B, 5), with a bronze monument by Schilling

<p class='c022'>The *Excursion to Miramar is best made in the afternoon; the traveller
should ascertain whether or not the park and château are open. The
highroad (4½ M.; motor-omnibus, see p. <a href='#Page_425'>425</a>) skirts the coast. We may
take the train also from the S. Station to (5 M.) <i>Miramar</i> or to (5½ M.)
<i>Grignano</i> and descend thence in ¼ hr. (or ½ hr.) to Miramar, or take
the tramway (p. <a href='#Page_425'>425</a>) to <i>Barcola</i> (sea-baths; Hôt. Excelsior) and walk
thence to (2½ M.) Miramar (motor-omnibus 60 <i>h</i>). The pleasantest route,
however, is that of the steamer (p. <a href='#Page_425'>425</a>),—The imperial château of
<b>Miramar</b>, on the beautiful <i>Punta di Grignano</i>, was built in 1854–6 by
Archd. Maximilian. It was here that he accepted the imperial crown of
Mexico (1864). The château, which has a charming park, is open to the
public (10–12 and 3–5, in winter 2–4; adm. 60 <i>h</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Italian Steamers</span> from Venice to Alexandria usually leave
the lagoons to the N. of the <i>Lido</i> (p. <a href='#Page_424'>424</a>), avoiding <i>Chioggia</i> and
the marshy delta of the <i>Po</i>. They then steer down the Adriatic Sea
towards Ancona. In clear weather we obtain a superb view of the
Alps, of the Euganean hills to the N.W., and of the <i>Apennines</i>,
whose offshoots come close down to the Adriatic near <i>Rimini</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Ancona</b> (Hôt. Roma e Pace, etc.; Brit, vice-consul; pop. 33,300,
incl. about 6000 Jews), 140 M. to the S.E. of Venice, a strongly
fortified town and the busiest seaport on the E. coast of Italy, is
splendidly situated between the headlands of <i>Monte Astagno</i> and
<i>Monte Guasco</i>, the N.W. spurs of Monte Conero (p. <a href='#Page_428'>428</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Harbour</i>, an oval basin open towards the W., is considered
the best in Italy. The well-preserved <i>Arch of Trajan</i>, in marble,
of 115 A.D., and a <i>Triumphal Arch</i> of the time of Pope Clement XII.
(1730–40) recall the two founders of the N. quays. The <i>Banchina</i>,
on the E. side of the harbour, is a modern quay (1880).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Dogana we may walk to the E. in a few minutes to
the church of <i>Santa Maria della Piazza</i>, with its lavishly decorated
façade (1210), and to the late-Gothic <i>Loggia dei Mercanti</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>(Exchange; 1454–9). A little to the E. is the <i>Prefettura</i> (15–16th
cent.), with its fine quadrangle and a superb Renaissance archway.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Via del Comune, near this, leads to the N., past the <i>Palazzo
del Comune</i> (of 1493, but much modernized), to the *<i>Cathedral</i> (San
Ciriaco; closed 12 to 4.30), on Monte Guasco, a fine point of view.
The church, in which Byzantine and Romanesque forms are mingled,
dates from 1128–89; the fine porch is of the 13th century.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Steamers</span> round the N. pier, and beyond <i>Monte dei Cappuccini</i>
(lighthouse) pass <i>Monte Conero</i> (1877 ft.; the ancient
<i>Promontorium Cunerum</i>), crowned with a Camaldulensian monastery.
This limestone mass does not form part of the Apennines,
in front of which it lies, and geologically considered is perhaps,
like Monte Gargano (see below), a relic of the great Dalmatian
limestone tableland (p. <a href='#Page_429'>429</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The coast recedes. In clear weather we sight in succession the
summits of the Central Apennines, snow-clad till July: <i>Monte
Vettore</i> (8130 ft.), the highest of the <i>Monti Sibillini</i>, the <i>Gran
Sasso d’Italia</i> (9561 ft.) in the <i>Abruzzi</i>, and the <i>Maiella</i>, with
<i>Monte Amaro</i> (9170 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>After some time we pass the four low <i>Trémiti Islands</i>, the
mythical <i>Insulae Diomedeae</i>, and then the rocky island of <i>Pianosa</i>
(ancient <i>Planasia</i>), beyond which we sight <i>Monte Gargáno</i>
(3464 ft.; <i>Mons Garganus</i>), once, as late as the tertiary age, an
island separated from the mainland by a strait.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off the lighthouse of <i>Vieste</i>, on the E. side of the peninsula, we
steer away from the <i>Bay of Manfredonia</i> and due S.E. to—</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Bari</b> (Hôt. Cavour, Corso Vittorio Emanuele; Caffè del Risorgimento,
at the hotel; Brit. vice-cons. and U. S. cons. agent; pop.
73,400), the ancient <i>Barium</i>, a provincial capital and the largest
trading town in Apulia. As in the time of Horace, this is the part
of the Adriatic where fish are most abundant.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the <i>Porto Nuovo</i>, on the N.W. side of the old town, Monte
Gargano, often cloud-capped, is visible even in rainy weather. The
small <i>Porto Vecchio</i>, on the E. side, admits small craft only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sights of the old town are the <i>Castle</i>, once that of the
Hohenstaufen, dating from Emp. Frederick II. (1223; now barracks
and signalling station), the <i>Cathedral</i>, a Romanesque church of the
12th cent. modernized in 1745, and the church of <i>San Nicóla</i>,
dedicated to St. Nicholas of Bari. San Nicola and the small church
of <i>San Gregorio</i> near it date from the end of the 11th century.—The
old town and the new (<i>Borgo</i>) are separated by the broad
<i>Corso Vittorio Emanuele</i>, which ends in pleasant promenades.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Bari we skirt the coast, where in the seaports of <i>Mola
di Bari</i>, <i>Polignano a Mare</i>, and <i>Monopoli</i>, with their white
houses, we see the first signs of the Orient. The <i>Faro di Penna</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>the lighthouse on <i>Capo Gallo</i>, and the lighthouses in the islands of
<i>Sant’ Andrea</i> (see below) and <i>Le Petagne</i> mark the approach to
(475 M.) <i>Brindisi</i> (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Austrian Lloyd Steamers</span>, on leaving <i>Trieste</i> (p. <a href='#Page_425'>425</a>), steer
to the S.W. through the <i>Bay of Trieste</i>, avoiding the numerous bays
of the N.W. coast of <i>Istria</i>; then, beyond the lighthouse of <i>Salvore</i>,
the ancient <i>Silvium Promontorium</i>, they keep in sight of the hilly,
olive-clad W. coast of Istria. We pass the small coast-towns of
<i>Umago</i>, <i>Cittanuova</i>, and <i>Parenzo</i> (ancient <i>Parentium</i>), then the
lighthouse on the <i>Marmi Bank</i>, the <i>Canal di Leme</i>, a kind of
fiord, backed by <i>Monte Maggiore</i> (4580 ft.), and the harbour of
<i>Rovigno</i>, sheltered by cliffs (scogli).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the cliff of <i>San Giovanni in Pélago</i> (lighthouse) we
pass the <i>Isŏle Brioni</i>, where the Venetians once quarried stone for
their palaces and churches. Fine view of the deeply cut bay of
<i>Pola</i>, the chief naval seaport of Austria, used also by the Romans
of the imperial age as a naval harbour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Cape Promontore</i> (ancient <i>Polaticum Promontorium</i>),
the flat S. extremity of Istria, with a lighthouse on the <i>Porer Cliff</i>,
a delightful view in clear weather is revealed of the Dalmatian
islands, relics of the ancient Dalmatian limestone plateau, now submerged
in the Adriatic. The most conspicuous are <i>Lussin</i> (<i>Apsorus
Insula</i>), culminating in <i>Monte Ossero</i> (1929 ft.), and to the
E., overtopped by it, <i>Unie</i> and <i>Sansego</i> with their lighthouses.</p>

<p class='c011'>We pass the large islands of <i>Lunga</i> or <i>Grossa</i> and <i>Incoronata</i>
(<i>Celadussae Insulae</i>), lying off the coast near Zara. A good way
farther on we sight the rocky islet of <i>Pomo</i>, midway between
Dalmatia and the E. coast of Italy; then the islands of <i>Sant’ Andrea</i>
(1001 ft.), <i>Busi</i> (788 ft.; containing the <i>Spelonca di Ballon</i>, resembling
the blue grotto of Capri), and <i>Lissa</i> (1920 ft.; ancient
<i>Issa</i>), where the Austrian fleet defeated the Italian in 1866.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the islands of <i>Cazza</i> (797 ft.) and <i>Lagosta</i> (1368 ft.;
ancient <i>Ladesta</i>) and the Italian island-group of <i>Pelagosa</i>, we
may descry <i>Monte Gargano</i> (p. <a href='#Page_428'>428</a>) to the S.W. in clear weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now steer straight towards the <i>Faro di Penna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_428'>428</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Brindisi</i> (pop. 22,000), a quiet town, the seat of an archbishop,
has been ever since ancient times an important starting-point for
the East. In the middle ages its harbour was often sought by the
Crusaders, and hosts of travellers now pass through it on their way
to or from Egypt, India, Australia, etc. The inner harbour, sheltered
from every wind, consists of two natural creeks formed by
erosion; in the southmost, the Seno di Ponte Piccolo, 492 yds. long,
the large steamers are easily berthed. The channel connecting the
inner harbour with the outer had become choked with sand in the
later middle ages, but was reopened in 1755 and lined with masonry
in 1866. On the island of <i>Sant’ Andrea</i>, outside the harbour,
rises a castle of the 15th cent., now a quarantine station.</p>

<p class='c011'>The town offers few sights. On a height close to the quay stands
a <i>Column</i>, 62 ft. high, with a rich capital containing figures of gods.
Adjacent is the base of a second column. The unfinished inscription
on the first mentions Lupus Protospatha, a Byzantine governor, who
restored the town in the 10th cent. after its destruction by the Saracens.
These columns are said to have marked the end of the Via
Appia which led from Rome to Tarentum and Brundisium, and they
perhaps bore a beacon-fire. The Gothic <i>Castle</i>, with its huge round
towers, on the N. creek, to the W. of the town, built by Emp. Frederik
II. about 1235 and strengthened by Charles V., now contains
a bagno for galley convicts. The baptistery of <i>San Giovanni al
Sepolcro</i> (11th cent.), with its fine portals and frescoes, is now a
museum of antiquities. The <i>Cathedral</i>, in its present form, is of
the 18th cent.; at the corner of a street opposite is a mediæval house
with an elaborate balcony. The Norman church of <i>San Benedetto</i>
(early 13th cent.) has an interesting side-portal and fine cloisters.
<i>Santa Lucia</i> has a crypt with relics of Byzantine frescoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving Brindisi the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> next passes through the <i>Straits
of Otranto</i>, the entrance to the Adriatic, about 47 M. in breadth,
within sight at first of the flat and marshy coast of Apulia, with
the lighthouse of <i>San Cataldo</i>. To the E., on the coast of <i>Albania</i>,
rise the <i>Acroceraunian Mts.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_496'>496</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Far away to the left appear the <i>Othonian Islands</i> (p. <a href='#Page_496'>496</a>),

<p class='c009'><i>Alexandria</i>, called by the Arabs and Turks <i>Iskanderîeh</i>, the
second town of Egypt, strongly fortified, and one of the most important
trading places on the Mediterranean, lies in 31° 11′ N. lat.
and 29° 53′ E. long., at the W. end of the <i>Nile Delta</i> (p. <a href='#Page_418'>418</a>), on a
strip of land separating <i>Lake Mareotis</i> from the sea. The population
is about 377,000, incl. 48,000 Europeans (‘Franks’), chiefly
Greeks and Italians, but many French and Austrians and a lesser
number of English and Germans. The Moslems live mostly in the
N. and W. quarters (comp. p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>), the Europeans chiefly in the E.
quarter or in Ramleh (p. <a href='#Page_436'>436</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Alexandria was founded in 331 B. C. by <i>Alexander the Great</i>, who
endeavoured to blend the land of the Pharaohs with his new Greek empire.
His Egyptian governor and successor, <i>Ptolemy I. Soter</i> (323–286),
made Alexandria a centre of art and science. He founded the Museum,
an institute for the promotion of science and poetry, to which the famous
Alexandrine library was attached. The highly advantageous position of
the town, which was connected, through Lake Mareotis, with the Nile by
several navigable channels, and whose harbour (unlike the other older
seaports at the mouth of the Nile) was protected by marine currents from
being silted up, led to the surprisingly rapid development of its trade and
prosperity under the <i>Ptolemies</i>. Alexandria had attained its zenith when,
in 48 B. C., the Romans intervened in the quarrels between <i>Cleopatra</i> and
her husband <i>Ptolemy XIV.</i> Both <i>Caesar</i>, who entered Alexandria in triumph
after the murder of Pompey at Pelusium, and <i>Antony</i> were ensnared
by Cleopatra. After the defeat of Antony’s partisans <i>Augustus</i>
founded the large E. suburb of <i>Nicopolis</i>. When at its prime the city is
said to have had a population of half-a-million inhabitants. The Greek
element predominated, after which came the Egyptian, while a Jewish
community had existed here ever since the time of Ptolemy I. Christianity
also took root in Alexandria at an early period, having been first proclaimed
here, according to tradition, by St. Mark the Evangelist.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the time of <i>Trajan</i> (96–117) the revolt of the Jews, who then composed
one-third of the population, gave rise to terrible bloodshed and
disaster. A century later the emperor <i>Caracalla</i> (211–7) paid a fateful
visit to the city, and, to punish the citizens for their contumacy, ordered
many of them to be massacred and the famous academy to be closed.
The city suffered even more severely from the persecution of the Christians
under <i>Decius</i> (250) and <i>Valerian</i> (257), from the plague in the reign of
<i>Gallienus</i>, and from its battles with the Palmyrenes (260–8). Having become,
like Carthage, a stronghold of Christian erudition, Alexandria afterwards
became the chief scene of the embittered controversies between
<i>Arius</i> (d. 336), a presbyter of the city, and the ‘orthodox’ bishops <i>Alexander</i>
and <i>Athanasius</i> (328–78). Even after the victory of the Athanasians at
the councils of Nicæa (325) and Constantinople (381) the Arian heresy,
which admitted the divine nature of Christ but denied his identity with
the Father, subsisted for centuries among the Germanic tribes.</p>

<p class='c022'>Under <i>Theodosius I.</i> (379–95) paganism received its death-blow, when
the patriarch <i>Theophilus</i> waged war against all heathen temples and
monuments. But the material prosperity of the city declined at the same
time. The citizens were no longer able to pay for the cleansing of the
Nile and the maintenance of the canals, and they were further impoverished
when the patriarch <i>Cyril</i> banished the Jews. In 619 the Persian
<i>Chosroes</i> made Alexandria his base for the conquest of Egypt. The country
was next overrun by the hordes of caliph <i>Omar</i>, whose general Amr
ibn el-Âsî captured Alexandria in 641. Its importance now declined still
further in the same proportion as Cairo, the new capital of the conquerors,
rose to wealth and importance. In 1303 and 1326 a great part
of the city, with the Pharus (p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>), was destroyed by earthquakes.
Lastly, the discovery of America and of the sea-route to India completed
the ruin of its trade.</p>

<p class='c022'>About the year 1800 the population of Alexandria had dwindled to
about 5000, but <i>Mohammed Ali</i> (p. <a href='#Page_414'>414</a>) wisely laid the foundations of a
new era of prosperity. He improved the harbours and constructed canals.
His great work was the <i>Mahmûdîyeh Canal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>), begun in 1819,
which fertilized anew the environs of the city and again connected it
with the interior of Egypt, which had long been obliged to export its
produce by way of Damietta and Rosetta. Subsequent rulers also were
zealous for the welfare of Alexandria. During the revolt of the national
party under <i>Arâbi Bey</i> (1882) Alexandria was bombarded by the British
fleet and the European quarter was burned down, but since then the city
has resumed its steady and vigorous career of progress.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>The old town of to-day lies partly on the <i>Heptastadion</i>, the
embankment ‘seven stadia’ (about 1430 yds.) in length, which ever
since the time of the Ptolemies has connected the mainland with
the island of <i>Pharos</i>, but which in the course of centuries has been
greatly widened. At the E. extremity of the island, now peninsula,
rises the picturesque <i>Fort Kâït Bey</i> (Pl. D, E, 1), on the site of
the famous ‘Pharus’, a lighthouse erected under Ptolemy II. Philadelphus
by Sostratus of Cnidos, in 280–279; it was originally 400 ells
(590 ft.) in height, and was deemed one of the seven wonders of the
world; it is supposed to have been the prototype of the Egyptian
minaret (comp. p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>). The main or ‘great’ harbour of that period,
protected by a huge embankment, is now the <i>Port Est</i>, the new
quays of which afford a pleasant seaside walk and are being completed
as a fashionable boulevard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Port Ouest</i>, the ancient <i>Eunostos</i> (‘haven of happy return’),
was little used till the later Roman age. Improved since
1871 it now consists of an inner basin of 475 acres, and a new
outer harbour of 1750 acres (p. <a href='#Page_418'>418</a>). From the beginning of the
Gabbari Mole extend quays with warehouses along the E. side of
this harbour to the <i>Naval Arsenal</i> (Pl. C, D, 3). Of the 2000
steamers entering the port annually more than half are under the
British flag. The inner harbour is connected with the <i>Mahmûdîyeh
Canal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_435'>435</a>) by means of locks. The chief exports are cotton,
cotton-seed, grain, beans, rice, sugar, onions, and tomatoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de la Marine (Pl. E, D, 5, 4; tramways, see p. <a href='#Page_431'>431</a>) and
its continuation the Rue Moutouch Pacha (Pl. D, 4, 3) form one of
the chief approaches to the peninsula of <i>Pharos</i> (see above). Between
the viceregal <i>Palace of Râs et-Tîn</i> (Pl. A, B, 3) and the Port Est
lies the <span class='sc'>Turkish Quarter</span>, with its pretty houses and a few gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Rue Râs et-Tîn</span>, the main street of the N. quarters, leads
past the <i>Government Buildings</i> (Pl. D, E, 3), to the S.E., to the
<span class='sc'>Arab Quarter</span>, lying on the ancient Heptastadion (see above) and
containing several <i>Sûks</i> or markets, which present an interesting
picture of Oriental life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue de France (Pl. E, F, 3, 4), the S.E. prolongation of the
Rue Râs et-Tîn, leads to the <b>Place Méhémet Ali</b> (Pl. F, 4), the
focus of European life, planted with trees and adorned with a
<i>Statue of Mohammed Ali</i> (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>) on horseback. The chief buildings
here are the <i>Palais de Justice</i>, the <i>Bourse</i>, and the <i>English
Church</i>. The last is adjoined by <i>St. Mark’s Building</i>, belonging
to the British community and used as a school and for official purposes.
From the W. harbour the Place Méhémet Ali is reached by
the Rue Bab el-Karasta (Pl. E, 5) and Rue Anastasi (Pl. E, F, 5, 4),
skirting the lofty <i>Fort Cafarelli</i> or <i>Napoléon</i> (Pl. E, 5; signalling
station).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the S. of the Place Méhémet Ali lies the triangular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>Square Ste. Catherine (Pl. F, 4), named after the Catholic
<i>Church of St. Catharine</i>. From this point we walk (or take a car
or motor-omnibus, see p. <a href='#Page_431'>431</a>) to the S.E. through the Rue Abou
Dardah (Pl. F, 4, 5) and Rue de la Colonne Pompée (Pl. F, G, 6, 7),
past the <i>Sidi Amr Mosque</i> (Pl. G, 6) and a large <i>Cimetière Arabe</i>
(Pl. F, 6, 7), to a bare hill, on the right, covered with débris.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here in the time of the Ptolemies rose the <i>Serapeum</i>, the most
superb temple in the city, dedicated to Serapis, god of the lower
regions. On the same site now stands <span class='sc'>Pompey’s Pillar</span> (Pl. F, G, 7;
adm. 3 pias.; see also p. <a href='#Page_432'>432</a>), the grandest memorial of antiquity
in the city. We ascend by steps to the plateau. All around are traces
of recent excavations, chiefly bringing to light relics of Roman
edifices. The column, composed of red granite from Assuan, is 88 ft.
high including the mutilated base. It is perhaps a Christian monument
of victory, dating from the time of Emp. Theodosius I. (p. <a href='#Page_433'>433</a>),
signalizing the destruction of the Serapeum (391). In the middle
ages it was supposed to be the tomb of Pompey.</p>

<p class='c011'>We follow the Rue Karmouss (Pl. G, 7, 8), which leads hence to
the S. to the <i>Mahmûdîyeh Canal</i>, and diverging to the right viâ
the Rue Bab el-Melouk, we pass a small mosque and reach (10 min.)
the entrance (Pl. ‘E.’; F, 8) to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Catacombs of Kôm esh-Shukâfa</b> (Pl. F, 8; ‘hill of potsherds’),
an Egyptian burial-place of the 2nd cent. A.D., hewn in
the rock. Adm. from 8 a.m. till dusk (5 pias.; see also p. <a href='#Page_432'>432</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>The tombs, discovered in 1900, consist of several stories and afford an
excellent example of the characteristic Alexandrine blend of the Egyptian
with the Græco-Roman style. They probably belonged to some Egyptian
magnate. Around the principal chambers are plainer vaults for the domestics
of the family. Modern stairs ascend to the restored entrance on the
hill-top. The interior is rendered accessible by wooden bridges and lighted
by electricity, but is partly under water.</p>

<p class='c022'>A spiral staircase, lighted by a large round shaft, descends near a
sarcophagus-chamber of later date to two stories. From the entrance to
the upper story we enter a rotunda covered with a kind of dome. On
the right are two smaller vaults with niches, sarcophagi, and shelf-tombs
(loculi). On the left is a large chamber, the Triclinium Funebre, used for
funeral banquets.</p>

<p class='c022'>The stairs divide farther down, affording a survey of the principal
chambers, and lead round the entrance to the *Tomb Chapel on the lowest
floor, with three niches for sarcophagi. Round the chapel runs a gallery,
accessible from the vestibule, with 91 shelf-tombs.</p>

<p class='c009'>An important thoroughfare, leading to the N.E. from the Rue
Abou Dardah (p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>), is the Rue Sidi el-Metwalli (Pl. F, G, 5, 4),
with its continuation the <span class='sc'>Rue de la Porte de Rosette</span> (Pl. F-I,
4, 3). These streets unite at the end of the busy Rue Chérif Pacha
(Pl. F, G, 4), a street of shops, coming from the Place Méhémet Ali
(p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>). This thoroughfare corresponds with the E. half of the
<i>Dromos</i>, the main street of the ancient city, which ended at the
<i>Canopic Gate</i>, the site of the now removed Porte de Rosette. In
the Rue du Musée, a N. side-street, is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>*<b>Museum</b> (Pl. H, 3), a building in the Greek style, which contains

end of the strip of land between <i>Lake Menzaleh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_418'>418</a>) and the
open sea, at the N. end of the <i>Suez Canal</i>, to which it owes its
foundation. Its trade, chiefly through-traffic, is growing rapidly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Harbour</i> of 570 acres has a depth of 26 ft., which is maintained
by laborious dredging. It is sheltered by two massive
breakwaters, the <i>Jetée Ouest</i>, 2460 yds. long, with a statue of Ferd.
de Lesseps (1805–94), the builder of the Suez Canal (1859–69), and
the <i>Jetée Est</i>, 1750 yds. long. The former protects it against the
mud of the Nile. Between these is the <i>Digue Nouvelle</i>, an inner
breakwater 597 yds. long, for shelter against E. winds; on the mainland
opposite (to the W.) rises the *<i>Phare</i>, a lighthouse 174 ft.
high, visible 23 M. away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The inner harbour of 220 acres consists of the <i>Bassin Ismaïl</i>
(with its three very shallow creeks), the <i>Bassin des Chalands
Charbonniers</i>, and the <i>Bassin Abbas Hilmi</i> or <i>Africa Basin</i>,

<p class='c011'>Beyond (28 M.) <i>El-Kantara</i> (‘the bridge’), the isthmus between
lakes Menzaleh and <i>Balah</i>, traversed by the time-honoured military

<p class='c011'>We next cross <i>El-Gisr</i> (‘the barrier’), a hill 52 ft. high, between

<p class='c022'>1. <span class='sc'>Drive</span> within a radius of 4 kil. (2½ M.) from the Administration
Building (Gouvernorat; Pl. D, 4), for 1 kil. 3, each addit. kil. 2 pias.; if

Complaints, with the number of the cab and other details, should be
lodged at the police-office (p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>). During the season the demands of the
cabmen are often exorbitant, but the mere mention of the dreaded word
‘karakól’ (prison) generally brings them to reason.</p>

as follows: from or to the Mena House (Pyramids) 10 pias., Heliopolis
8 pias., Citadel, Gîzeh 5 pias., Gezîreh 3 pias.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Donkeys</b> (Arabic <i>homâr</i>; per hour about 2, day 12 pias.) abound. They
are pleasant on bridle-paths free from dust. The donkey-boys (<i>hammâr</i>)
often lash the animals into a gallop, but this should be checked. <i>Ala
mahlak</i> means ‘slow’, <i>erbût</i> or the English <i>stop</i> ‘halt’. The bakshish
should be of course proportioned to the donkey-boy’s behaviour.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Cairo</i>, Arabic <i>El-Kâhira</i> or <i>Masr el-Kâhira</i>, or simply <i>Masr</i>
or <i>Misr</i> (after the old Semitic name of Egypt), lies in 30° 4′ N.
lat. and 31° 17′ E. long., on the right bank of the Nile, about
12½ M. to the S. of the ‘cow’s belly’, where the river divides into
the Rosetta and Damietta arms (p. <a href='#Page_418'>418</a>).—On the E. side of the
city, which covers an area of about 11 sq. M., rise the reddish
rocky slopes of the <i>Mokattam Hills</i> (p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>; about 650 ft.), marking
the beginning of the Arabian desert.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cairo, the largest city in Africa and in the whole of the Arabian
world, is the residence of the Khedive and of all the chief authorities.
The population is estimated at 630,000, including 50,000
Europeans, chiefly Greeks and Italians. The great majority of the
citizens are Egypto-Arabian, Fellah (peasant) settlers, Christian
Copts (also nearly pure descendants of the ancient Egyptians),
Nubians, Turks, Armenians, and (about 6000) Jews; then negroes
of many different tribes, Berbers and Arabs from the N. African
seaboard, Bedouins (nomadic Arabs), Syrians, Persians, Indians.
The street scenes in the older quarters are very curious and picturesque.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> In hoar antiquity a suburb of Heliopolis (p. <a href='#Page_459'>459</a>) lay on the
E. bank of the Nile, opposite the great Pyramids, and was called by the
Egyptians <i>Kherē-ohē</i>, or place of combat, because the gods Horus and
Seth, the tutelary deities of Upper and Lower Egypt respectively, are
said to have fought there. The Greeks called it <i>Babylon</i>, probably in
imitation of the Egyptian name of the island of Rôda, <i>Perhapi-n-On</i>, the
‘Nile city of On’ (Heliopolis). The Roman citadel of Babylon was garrisoned
under Augustus by one of the three legions stationed in Egypt.
In 611 A.D. the town was conquered by <i>Amr ibn el-Âsî</i> (p. <a href='#Page_433'>433</a>), who
founded the new capital of the country in the plain to the N. of the
fortress, a city which, unlike Alexandria, was to be free from the hated
Christian element. On the site of his <i>fostât</i> or tent he built a mosque,
and the new city then took the name of Fostât. Between Fostât and the
citadel and adjoining the older suburb of <i>El-Askar</i> (of 815) the new
quarter of <i>El-Katâi</i> was begun by <i>Ahmed ibn Tulûn</i> (868–83), founder of
the Egyptian dynasty of the Tulunides, but it was burned down in 905.
The Cairo of to-day owes its origin mainly to <i>Gôhar</i>, the general of the
Fatimites (p. <a href='#Page_323'>323</a>), who conquered Egypt in 969 and founded a new town
to the N.E. of El-Katâi and made it the residence of the caliph and head
quarters of his army. At the hour when its foundations were laid the
planet Mars (Arabic Kâhir, ‘the victorious’) is said to have crossed the
meridian of the new city, whence it received its new name of <i>Masr el-Kâhira</i>
or <i>El-Kâhira</i>, while Fostât was afterwards called, by way of
distinction, <i>Masr el-Kadîmeh</i> or <i>el-Atika</i> (Old Cairo). In 973 <i>Abû Teminn
el-Muizz</i> transferred his residence from Mehdia (p. <a href='#Page_369'>369</a>) to Cairo. Two
centuries later the famous <i>Saladin</i> comes prominently on the scene. This
was the Kurd general of mercenaries, <i>Salâheddîn Yûsuf ibn Aiyûb</i>, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>on the death of the last Fatimite in 1171, usurped the supreme power.
He built a new citadel on the slope of the Mokattam Hills and enclosed the
whole city with a wall 29,000 ells long (p. <a href='#Page_453'>453</a>), and Cairo soon became
the most populous place in N. Africa next to Fez. Under the dynasty
of the <i>Aiyubides</i> (1171–1250) and the <i>Mameluke Dynasties</i> (Bahrite, 1250–1382,
and Circassian or Borgite, 1382–1517), the sultans chosen from the white
body-guard, Cairo witnessed almost continuous scenes of revolution, rapine,
and bloodshed. In 1302 it suffered severely also from an earthquake, and
terribly in 1295 and 1492 from the plague. And yet, in spite or all these
disasters, the city grew and prospered wonderfully.</p>

<p class='c022'>After his victory at Heliopolis in 1517 the Osman sultan <i>Selim I.</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) marched into Cairo; <i>Tûman Bey</i>, the last Mameluke sultan, was
captured and executed; and Selim caused the finest marble columns in
the citadel to be removed to Constantinople. Cairo now became the seat
of a bey (‘prince’), who was placed over the twenty-four Mameluke chiefs
entrusted with the government of Egypt and was controlled by a Turkish
pasha. Thenceforth the city was a mere provincial capital.</p>

<p class='c022'>It was not till 1798 that Cairo again became prominent in history.
After the Battle of the Pyramids <i>Bonaparte</i> had his headquarters for
several months in the ancient city of the caliphs. From Cairo in 1799
he started on his Syrian expedition; and when he returned to France
Kléber remained behind as commander-in-chief of the French troops. Kléber
was assassinated in Cairo in 1800, and the following year the French
garrison, hard pressed by the grand-vizier and the British troops, had to
capitulate.</p>

<p class='c022'>Under <i>Mohammed Ali</i> (1805–48), the new Turkish pasha, with whom
begins the modern chapter in the chequered history of Egypt, and who
did much to develop the resources of the country, the citadel of Cairo
witnessed another tragedy in 1811, when by his order the last of the
Mameluke beys were shot (comp. p. <a href='#Page_453'>453</a>). His successors, particularly
<i>Ismaîl</i> (1863–79; Khedive or viceroy from 1867) and <i>Tewfik</i> (Arabic <i>Taufîk</i>;
1879–92), greatly improved and extended the city by the construction of
new quarters (Ismaîlîyeh and Tewfîkîyeh, p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>), though to the prejudice
of its mediæval architecture; and under the present Khedive <i>Abbâs II.
Hilmi</i> (b. 1874) Cairo has expanded as far as the islands in the Nile. Since
the defeat of the national party under <i>Arâbi Bey</i> (p. <a href='#Page_433'>433</a>) in 1882 the
country in general and Cairo in particular have prospered greatly. The
paramount British control of the administration is more noticeable at
Cairo than at Alexandria or on the Suez Canal.</p>

<p class='c022'>A convenient short history of Cairo is ‘The Story of Cairo’, by <i>Stanley
Lane-Poole</i>, in the ‘Mediæval Towns Series’ (2nd ed., London, 1906).
Comp, also ‘Cairo and its Environs’, by <i>A. O. Lamplough</i> and <i>R. Francis</i>
(London, 1909, illus.; 20<i>s.</i>) and ‘The City of the Caliphs’, by <i>E. A. Reynolds-Ball</i>
(Boston and London, 1897).</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>History of Art.</span> The Arabian architecture of Egypt is founded
partly on antique, on Byzantine, and on Coptic models which the conquerors
of the country found ready to their hand, and partly on Persian
types, developed under the Sassanides and adopted by the Arabs with
the aid of native builders. The chief Arabian edifices at Cairo are the
mosques, the fountains, and the tombs. The period of their construction
extends from the time of the Tulunides (9th cent.) down to the conquest
of Egypt by the Turks (1517). Of the earlier buildings, known to us
only from the fantastic descriptions of Arabian authors, hardly a trace
is left. The later edifices, partly of Arabian-Turkish type with Egyptian-Arabian
ornamentation, seldom show much artistic merit.</p>

<p class='c022'>The oldest mosques (<i>gâmia</i>, or chief mosque; <i>mesgid</i>, smaller mosque
or chapel), such as the Amru Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>) and that of Ibn Tulûn
(p. <a href='#Page_451'>451</a>), are simple in plan. A quadrangle (<i>sahn</i>), answering to the atrium
of the Byzantine basilica, is flanked with four flat-roofed colonnades
(<i>lîwân</i>), which on three sides are single or double, while on the fourth
side, in the direction of Mecca, the chief lîwân (sanctuarium) is composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>of several aisles or arcades. The cruciform <i>medreseh</i> (school-mosque),
of Persian origin, was first introduced by Saladin the Aiyubide. The
lîwâns were now roofed with massive barrel-vaulting, and in their four
corners were introduced schools or lecture-rooms for the four orthodox
sects of Islam (Hanefites, Shafiites, Malekites, and Hambalites). To the
second Mameluke dynasty (1382–1517) Cairo owes its most beautiful specimens
of Arabian architecture. In the smaller mosques the lateral
lîwâns were shortened, the court reduced in size, roofed in, and lighted
from above, and the transepts were again roofed with flat timber ceilings.
In the Turkish period, as in the case of the mosque of Mohammed Ali
(p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>), the four lîwâns were often replaced by a single vaulted hall,
preceded by a forecourt.</p>

<p class='c022'>The minarets, always in three stories, are of the Pharos or lighthouse
type (p. <a href='#Page_434'>434</a>; Arabic <i>manara</i>, light).</p>

<p class='c022'>Most of the mosques built since the middle of the 14th cent. have
a <i>sebîl</i> attached. This is a public street-fountain, roofed over, with a
chamber above it (<i>kuttâb</i>) used as an elementary school.</p>

<p class='c022'>The tombs of sultans and emirs are always connected with the mosques.
The tombs of saints or <i>sheikhs</i>, on the other hand, as everywhere in the
East, are independent buildings, domed like the burial-chapels in the
mosques. The ordinary tombs of the Moslems are underground chambers;
above the vault usually stands a sarcophagus or cenotaph (<i>tarkîbeh</i>).
Wealthy families enclosed their tombs with halls for funeral festivals,
rooms for the mourners, a dwelling for the custodian, etc., collectively
called a <i>hôsh</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>Of the old palaces and caravanserais a few ruins only remain. The
latter (<i>okellas</i>; Arabic <i>wakkâleh</i>) served also as warehouses (<i>khân</i>). Of
the mediæval dwelling-house the so-called Bookbinder’s House (p. <a href='#Page_449'>449</a>) is
a good example.</p>

<p class='c022'>Sculpture and painting existed as independent arts under the Tulunides
and Fatimites, being favoured by the Persians and the sect of
the Shiites, but in the later Egyptian-Arabian art they survived only in
the ornamentation of walls. The main features of this surface decoration
consisted in curiously interlaced geometrical figures (entrelacs) and conventional
foliage (arabesques). Both mosques and private houses often
have charming <i>kamarîyehs</i>, or windows of perforated slabs of plaster,
inlaid with coloured glass. The façades of the older houses are adorned
also with picturesque oriel-windows and with <i>mashrebîyehs</i>, or balcony-gratings
or lattice-work of beech-wood rods.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. Northern Quarters.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The main thoroughfare here is the <span class='sc'>Shâria Clot Bey</span> (Pl. B, C, 2;
tramway No. 7, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>), leading from the <i>Railway Stations</i> and
the <i>Limûn Bridge</i> (Pl. B, 1) to the Mîdân el-Khaznedâr (Pl. C, 3),
adjoining which, between the old Arabian Cairo and the new town
(p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>), is the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Ezbekîyeh Garden</b>, the chief rallying-point of strangers.
The name is derived from the Ezbek mosque which once stood here,
built in 1495 in honour of a general of the sultan Kâït Bey (p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>).
The grounds (adm. ½ pias.), 20 acres in area, laid out by <i>Barillet</i>
in 1870, contain many rare trees and plants. The open spaces are
planted with <i>Lippia nodiflora</i> instead of grass, which does not
thrive in this dry climate. Among the attractions are a café, a
restaurant, a summer theatre, and evening concerts (see p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>To the S. of the Ezbekîyeh Garden rises the <i>Opera House</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>), between which and the Hôtel Continental is the <span class='sc'>Place de
l’Opéra</span> (Mîdân et-Teatro; Pl. B, C, 3), with the monument of the
famous general <i>Ibrâhîm Pasha</i> (d. 1848). From this point the
Shâria Abdîn leads to the S. to the spacious <i>Mîdân Abdîn</i>, where
the <i>Khedivial Palace</i> (Pl. C, 4, 5) rises on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of the Place de l’Opéra, between the Ezbekîyeh and the
Opera House, the Shâria et-Teatro leads to the small Mîdân Ezbek,
in which are the <i>Tribunaux Mixtes</i> (Pl. C, 3; international law-courts).
A parallel street, Shâria Tâhir, in which is the <i>General
Post Office</i> (Pl. C, 3; p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>), on the right, leads to the <span class='sc'>Atabet
el-Khadra</span>, where the principal tramways intersect (p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the E. side of this square begins the *<b>Muski</b>, or <b>Mouski</b>
(Pl. C, D, 3), which, with its continuations the Sikket el-Gedîdeh
and Shâria esh-Sharawâni (Pl. E, F, 3), is 1 M. long, and forms
the chief artery of the Oriental quarters, intersecting the whole of
the old town. Externally these streets have lost their mediæval
character, the shops appearing quite European, but the motley
throng that surges through them at all hours is still quite Oriental.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the Muski, near the Sûk el-Kanto (Pl. D, 3), we
enter the old <b>Fatimite City</b> (<i>Masr el-Kâhira</i>, p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>), to whose
second wall, dating from 1074, belonged the still existing N. gateways
<i>Bâb el-Futûh</i> and <i>Bâb en-Nasr</i> (Pl. E, 2; p. <a href='#Page_449'>449</a>), and the
S. gateway <i>Bâb Zuweileh</i> (Pl. E, 4; p. <a href='#Page_450'>450</a>). The old town was
bounded on the W. by the old town-conduit <i>El-Khalîg</i>, now Shâria
Khalîg el-Masri (tramways Nos. 2 &#38; 9, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Gâmia el-Ashraf</i> (Pl. E, 3), a small mosque built by Sultan
Bars Bey (1422–38), at the point where the Sikket el-Gedîdeh
is crossed by the old and important line of streets (1 M. long) between
Bâb el-Futûh and Bâb Zuweileh, lies in the heart of the
<b>Market Quarter</b>, which, though usually overcrowded, especially
in the early morning, should by all means be visited.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately to the left of the Shâria el-Khordagîyeh (Pl. E, 3;
p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>), which leads from the mosque to the N., is the <i>Sûk es-Sâigh</i>
(pl. siyâgh), the bazaar of the goldsmiths and silversmiths, who
keep their wares under glass in their cramped little shops, selling
them by weight (but often spurious).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the opposite (E.) side of the same street is the <i>Khân el-Khalîli</i>
(Pl. E, 3), founded in 1400 on the site of the Fatimite
tombs, and once the centre of business. Vendors of silks and carpets,
of trinkets and other wares are still located here. Buyers
who are judges of carpets will select those of Bagdad or Brussa,
but exorbitant prices are generally asked. The silk-stuffs of Lyons
and Crefeld often do duty for those of Damascus. The main street
of the khân, Sikket el-Bâdistân, contains two pretty Arabian gates.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the mosque of El-Ashraf runs the Shâria el-Ashrafîyeh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>(Pl. E, 3), whence the Shâria el-Hamzâwî es-Seghîr diverges
to the right. This street, continued by the Shâria el-Hamzâwî el-Kebîr
(Pl. D, 3), forms the <i>Sûk el-Hamzâwî</i>, the market of the
Christian traders (Syrians and Copts). Here, immediately to the
left, is the Shâria et-Tarbîyeh (Pl. E, 3), with the <i>Sûk el-Attârîn</i>,
or spice-market (comp. p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite the entrance to the Hamzâwî is the Shâria es-Sanâdikîyeh
(Pl. E, 3), also called <i>Sûk es-Sudân</i>, for the produce of the
Sudan (india-rubber, dûm-palm nuts, etc.).—The last side-street
on the left, the Shâria el-Halwagî (Pl. E, 3; the direct way to the
university from Shâria esh-Sharawâni, p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), is the seat of the
<i>Booksellers</i> (over 20 shops).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Shâria el-Azhar, behind the small <i>Mosque of Mohammed
Bey Abû Dahab</i> (1770), is the chief entrance of the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Gâmia el-Azhar</b> (Pl. E, 3, 4; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>; photographing
prohibited), ‘the flourishing’, the finest building of the
Fatimite period. It was completed by Gôhar (p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>) in 973, and
converted into a university by caliph El-Azîz in 988, but after the
earthquake of 1302 was almost entirely rebuilt by Emir Salar.
The venerable edifice, whose rectangular plan is still distinctly
traceable, was again materially altered by the wealthy Abd er-Rahmân
Kikhya in 1759. The university is still considered the
most important in the territories of Islam. In 1909 there were
10,000 students (<i>mugâwirîn</i>) and 319 teachers (<i>sheikhs</i>). The
rector is called the <i>Sheikh el-Azhar</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Adjoining the N.W. façade, erected by Abbâs II. (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>) in the neo-Arabian
style, is the Bâb el-Museiyinîn (‘barber’s gate’), built in the
time of Abd er-Rahmân, now the chief entrance, where a guide is assigned
to the visitor. Adjacent to the gateway, on the right, is the <i>Mesgid
Taibarsîyeh</i>, restored by Abd er-Rahmân, containing a superb mihrâb or
prayer-recess of 1309, richly adorned with mosaics. On the left is the
<i>Zâwiyet el-Ibtighâwîyeh</i>, also of the 14th cent., now the library.</p>

<p class='c022'>The handsome inner portal, built along with the contiguous minaret
by Kâït Bey (p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>), leads into the <i>sahn</i> (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>), or chief quadrangle,
flanked with five minarets, and always enlivened by knots of students,
mostly grouped in their various nationalities. The colonnades, restored in
the time of Tewfik (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>), have the Persian keel-arches, in special favour
with the Shiites, the walls above which are tastefully decorated with
medallions and niches and crowned with pinnacles. The lateral lîwâns
on the N.E. and S.W. sides of the quadrangle are allotted to students of
different countries and provinces as sleeping-apartments and studies (riwâk).
The court of ablutions (p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>), behind the N.E. lîwân, dates from the
time of Kâït Bey.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <i>Chief Lîwân</i>, or sanctuary, on the S.E. side of the quadrangle,
with its 140 antique and Byzantine marble columns, forms the great lecture-room.
No lectures are given on Thursdays or during the fasting-month
of Ramadan. The low front half of this great hall, with its four
much restored rows of arcades, belongs to the original building. The
dome of the vestibule, the broad transept borne by two rows of columns,
and the dome of the old mihrâb, all point to the Sidi Okba mosque of
Kairwan (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>) as their prototype. The raised inner half of the sanctuary,
with its two prayer-niches, was added by Abd er-Rahmân.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>The dilapidated <i>Okella of Kâït Bey</i> (1496), behind the S. angle
of the university, with its sebîl (p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>), has a charming façade.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next visit the N. half of the old city of the Fatimites. In
the <span class='sc'>Shâria el-Gohergîyeh</span> (Pl. E, 3), in line with Shâria el-Khordagîyeh
(p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), we are struck with the façades (on the left) of the
Muristân Kalâûn, the Medreseh Mohammed en-Nâsir, and the Barkûkîyeh,
on the site of the Fatimite palaces.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Muristân Kalâûn</b> (Pl. E, 3), a great hospital begun by
the Mameluke sultan El-Mansûr Kalâûn (1279–90) in 1285, shows
the influence of the European architectural style which the Crusaders
had introduced into Syria. The massive portal, flanked with
a minaret 192 ft. high, leads into a long corridor. On the left is a
small <i>Mosque</i>, partly restored. On the right is the *<i>Tomb of Kalâûn</i>,
completed in 1293 by his son Mohammed en-Nâsir (1293–1340),
one of the most beautiful Arabian buildings in Cairo. The
square hall has a rich timber ceiling; the mosaics of the walls and
central pillars are composed of marble and mother-of-pearl, and the
superb prayer-niche is enriched with porphyry columns and dwarf
arcades. The wards for the sick and lecture-rooms, grouped round
the large quadrangle, now partly used as store-rooms and workshops,
are sadly disfigured.</p>

<p class='c011'>The adjoining *<i>Medreseh Mohammed en-Nâsir</i> (Pl. E, 3), dating
from 1303, also is in a ruinous condition. It is entered by a Gothic
church-portal brought from Acre in Syria. The fine minaret, the
sanctuary (on the left), and the tomb of the founder (on the right)
show remains of tasteful stucco decoration recalling the Alhambra
(p. <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Barkûkîyeh</i> (Pl. E, 3), the medreseh of the Mameluke sultan
Barkûk (1382–99), with its octagonal minaret, has suffered from the
gaudy modern painting of the sanctuary and of the mausoleum, in
which reposes a daughter of Barkûk. The dikkeh for the prayer-reciter
(p. <a href='#Page_180'>180</a>) is modern.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther to the N. in the same line of streets is the lively <span class='sc'>Shâria
en-Nahhâsîn</span>, in which is the market of the coppersmiths. On the
right is the façade of the <i>Dâr Beshtâk Palace</i> (Pl. E, 3), erected by
Emir Beshtâk in 1330, but now entirely altered. At the next bifurcation
we come to the *<i>Sebîl Abd er-Rahmân</i> (p. <a href='#Page_447'>447</a>), one of the
finest structures of the kind. Upstairs the hall of an elementary school
affords from its windows a capital view of the busy Nahhâsîn Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on the main street is called <span class='sc'>Shâria el-Margush el-Barrâni</span>.
Immediately to the right is the <i>Gâmia el-Ahmar</i> (Pl. E,
2; ‘red mosque’), built in 1125 by the grand vizier of the Fatimite
Amr ben Mustali. The fine façade, recently brought to light in
part, with its high pointed niches in square framework alternating
with smaller niches in two stories, shows the oldest stalactite vaulting
in Cairo, and is therefore historically interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>Near the end of the same thoroughfare, here called Shâria Bâb
el-Futûh, we come to the entrance, on the right, of the ruinous
<i>Gâmia el-Hâkim</i> (Pl. E, 2), begun, outside the oldest town-wall,
by El-Aziz (p. <a href='#Page_447'>447</a>) in 990, on the model of the mosque of Ibn Tulûn
(p. <a href='#Page_451'>451</a>), and completed by his son El-Hâkim in 1012. The two
minarets, with their heavy square setting, rise from the middle of
the second town-wall (p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), which is here well preserved. Their
superstructures, crowned with domes and resembling an Arabian
censer (<i>mabkhâra</i>), belong to the period when the mosque was restored
after the earthquake of 1302.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two ancient gate-towers, the <i>Bâb el-Futûh</i> (Pl. E, 2; ‘gate
of the conquests’) at the end of the street and the neighbouring <i>Bâb
en Nasr</i> (‘gate of victory’; reached by the Shâria el-Kassasineh),
which was pierced with loopholes in the time of Bonaparte, recall
the late-Roman and Byzantine gateway castles. The town-wall
(adm. 2 pias.) affords an interesting survey of the whole group of
buildings.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to the Gâmia el-Ashraf (p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>) to complete our
visit to the S. part of the old town of the Fatimites. At the beginning
of the <span class='sc'>Shâria el-Ghûrîyeh</span> (Pl. E, 4), the continuation of the
Shâria el-Ashrafîyeh (p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), rises the double monument of the
Mameluke sultan Kânsûh el-Ghûri (1501–16), with its fine façades:
on the right is the <i>Medreseh el-Ghûri</i> (Pl. E, 3, 4), whose minaret,
213 ft. high, is incongruously crowned with five modern dwarfed
domes; on the left is the <i>Mausoleum</i>, with its charming sebîl. The
sultan, who fell in Syria, was not, however, buried here.—A few
paces to the E., in the Shâria et-Tableta which leads to the Azhar
mosque (p. <a href='#Page_447'>447</a>), is the <i>Okella of El-Ghûri</i> (Pl. E, 3, 4), now
entirely disfigured.</p>

<p class='c011'>In line with the Shâria el-Ghurîyeh, farther to the S., is the <span class='sc'>Shâria
el-Akkâdîn</span> (Pl. E, 4). A little to the E. of it, in the side-street
Hôsh Kadam (No. 12), is the so-called *<span class='sc'>Bookbinder’s House</span>
(<i>Beit Gamâl ed-Dîn</i>; Pl. E, 4), built in 1637 by the president of
the merchants’ guild, an admirable example of an Arabian dwelling-house
(fee 2 pias.).</p>

<p class='c016'>A crooked passage (<i>dirkeh</i>) leads into the court of the Salamlîk, the
apartments of the owner, with two well-preserved façades. In the S.W.
angle are stairs ascending to the Makad or reception-room, an open colonnade
with two arches. Adjoining it is an oriel-window closed with mashrebîyehs
(p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>), from which the women could overlook the court. Farther on we
come to the handsome Kâa, the banqueting-room of the harem, adorned
with superb mosaics. In the centre of it is a lower chamber (<i>durkâa</i>)
roofed with a wooden dome. The flat timber ceilings of the two <i>lîwâns</i>,
or lateral rooms, are very fine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still farther to the S., in the same line, runs the <span class='sc'>Sukkarîyeh</span>
(Pl. E, 4), the market for sugar, dried fruit (<i>nukl</i>), fish, candles,
etc.—On the right rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>*<b>Gâmia el-Muaiyad</b> (Pl. D, E, 4), begun by the Mameluke
sultan Sheikh el-Mahmûdi Muaiyad (1412–21), and completed a year
after his death. In plan it resembles the convent-mosque of Barkûk
(p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>). The sumptuous portal, with its striped marble enrichment
and stalactite or honeycomb half-domes, is well preserved. The
*Bronze Gate, the finest in Cairo, was brought from the mosque of
Hasan (p. <a href='#Page_452'>452</a>). The main court and the lateral lîwâns, with their
heavy modern outer walls, now form shady grounds. The sanctuary,
restored in 1880, is a splendid hall of three arcades with lofty stilted
arches. The decoration of the back-wall and the coloured wooden
ceiling are charming. To the left of the sanctuary is the mausoleum
of the sultan, and to the right that of his family. The two minarets,
167 ft. high, rise from the platform of the <i>Bâb Zuweileh</i> (Pl. E, 4;
p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), or <i>Bâb el-Mitwelli</i>, the S. gate of the Fatimite city.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Bâb Zuweileh the Shâria Taht er-Rebâa leads to the W. to
the Place Bâb el-Khalk (Pl. D, 4; see below); to the S. run the Kasabet
Radowân, a <i>Shoemakers’ Market</i>, where the favourite red slippers (p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>)
are sold, and the Shâria el-Khiyamîyeh, the bazaar for gaily coloured
<i>Tent-Covers</i>, leading to the Shâria Mohammed Ali (see below).</p>

<p class='c022'>To the E. of the Bâb Zuweileh runs a line of streets, bending round to
the S., to the <i>Citadel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_453'>453</a>). Nearly opposite the gate, at the corner
of Kasabet Radowân and Derb el-Ahmar, is the small <i>Mosque of Sâlih
Telâyeh</i> (Pl. E, 4), dating from the reign of El-Âdid, the last of the
Fatimites (1160). The sanctuary contains some beautiful stucco ornamentation
in the Syrian-Arabian style.—In the Derb el-Ahmar, farther on,
to the left, rises the small *<b>Mosque of Emir Kijmâs</b> (Pl. E, 4), built
in 1481 by a master-of-the-horse of Kâït Bey (p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>). The interior is a
perfect gem of its kind.</p>

<p class='c022'>Farther on this line of streets is called Shâria et-Tabbâneh. On the
right rises the *<b>Mosque el-Merdani</b> (Pl. E, 5), one of the largest in
Cairo. It was built by the cup-bearer of sultan Mohammed en-Nâsir (p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>)
in 1338–40 and after having almost fallen to ruin was recently restored.
The sanctuary is still separated from the court by its old <i>maksûra</i>, or
wooden screen. The prayer-recess and its sides are lavishly enriched
with costly mosaics. The dome in front of the prayer-niche, partly restored
with cement, rests on ancient Egyptian granite columns.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The South-Eastern Quarters.</h4>

<p class='c021'>Starting from the Place Atabet el-Khadra (p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>) the featureless
<span class='sc'>Shâria Mohammed Ali</span> (Pl. C-E, 3–6), 1860 yds. long, leads to the
Citadel (tramway No. 6, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>). After 8 min. it crosses the former
town-conduit <i>El-Khalîg</i> (p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>). On the left is the <span class='sc'>Place Bâb
el-Khalk</span>, with the <i>Gouvernorat</i> (government-house; Pl. D, 4;
containing the <i>Police Office</i>, p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>), and the superb new buildings
of the <i>Arab Museum</i> and the <i>Khedivial Library</i> (1902).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Arab Museum</b>, founded by <i>Franz Pasha</i>, a learned
German architect, on the groundfloor of the building, contains a
large and valuable collection of objects of art, mostly from old
mosques and houses in Cairo. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>; entrance on the E.
side. Director, M. Herz Bey.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the Vestibule is shown a chronological list of the Mohammedan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>dynasties of Egypt.—Room I. Tombstones.—Room II. Sculptures in
stone.—Room III. Stone sculptures, casts, mosaics.</p>

<p class='c022'>Rooms IV-VIII. Wood-carving, including pulpits (mimbar), reading-desks
for the Koran and tables (kursi), movable prayer-niches and Koran-boxes
from mosques, mashrebîyehs (p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Rooms IX &#38; X. Metal-work. Fine bronze doors from the mosque
of Sâlih Telâyeh (p. <a href='#Page_450'>450</a>) and elsewhere; a Koran-case with brass cover
and silver enrichment, candlesticks, lustres in metal, bronze candelabra
(tannûr).—Rooms XI &#38; XII. Fayence, including tiles of European make,
a favourite wall-decoration in Arabian houses of the 18–19th centuries.</p>

<p class='c022'>Room XIII. Wall-incrustations in stucco; Arabian room from Rosetta.—Room
XIV. Specimens of textiles; two Koran-cases covered with leather
from the Hasan mosque (p. <a href='#Page_452'>452</a>).—Rooms XV &#38; XVI. Enamelled *Mosque
Lamps, the richest collection of the kind, mostly from the Hasan mosque.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first floor of the building contains the <b>Khedivial Library</b>
(<i>Kutubkhâneh</i>, entered from the Shâria Mohammed Ali), founded in
1870 and arranged by German savants. It consists of 68,000 vols.
(about 32,000 being Oriental), including 2700 Korans. The illuminated
Persian MSS. are extremely valuable. The Exhibition Room
(adm., see p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>) contains also a fine collection of the coins of the
Moslem rulers of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now follow, to the S.W., the long <span class='sc'>Shâria Khalîg el-Masri</span>
(Pl. D, C, 4–6; tramways Nos. 2 &#38; 9, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>) to a small square with
the <i>Gâmia es-Seiyideh Zeinab</i> (Pl. C, 6, 7), and then turn to the
S.E. into the <span class='sc'>Shâria el-Marâsîn</span> (Pl. C, 7), near the end of which
the Derb Tanaïfa leads to the right to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Medreseh Kâït Bey</b> (Pl. C, 7), in the <i>Kalat el-Kabsh</i>
quarter of the city. Built in 1475, shortly after the sultan’s burial-mosque
(p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>), and recently restored by Herz Bey, it offers a good
example of the architecture of the second Mameluke dynasty (see
p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>). The minaret is one of the most tasteful in Cairo. In the
richly decorated interior we specially note the fine ornaments on
the arches of the court-façades, the stalactites of the window-niches,
the mosaic pavement, and the pulpit. The dome is modern.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Shâria er-Rahaba and the winding Shâria Kalat el-Kabsh
lead to the E. in a few minutes to the picturesque Shâria ez-Ziyadeh
(Pl. D, 7), on the S.W. side of the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Gâmia Ibn Tulûn</b> (Pl. D, 7), the oldest in Cairo next to
the Amru mosque (p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>). It stands near the N. border of what
was once the Katâi quarter, on the rocky <i>Gebel Yeshkûr</i> (33 ft.).
It was erected by Ahmed ibn Tulûn (p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>) on Mesopotamian
models in 876–9, immediately after the last extension of the
Kairwan mosque (p. <a href='#Page_374'>374</a>), and was the largest of that period in all
the lands of Islam. The total area of its precincts is 30,720 sq. yds.,
while the mosque itself, without the courts, forms a huge square of
150 by 132 yds. The external façades, which are almost undecorated,
are relieved by pointed windows and niches and with
shell-shaped half-domes and are crowned with pinnacles. We first
pass through the E. forecourt to the sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>The chief quadrangle, about 99 yds. square, is enclosed by
double arcades on three sides, while the sanctuary has four arcades
(originally five, the fifth having collapsed in 1875). The façades of
the court are relieved by pointed windows and rosettes in the spandrels
above the brick pillars; still higher runs a frieze of rosettes,
and the whole is crowned with pinnacles. In the interior the ornamentation
framing the arcades and the foliage frieze on the wall-spaces
are carved in stucco, exhibiting as yet none of the intricate
forms of the Byzantine-Arabian style. The old prayer-recess with
its fine Byzantine capitals and fragments of Byzantine glass-mosaics
is noteworthy. The dikkeh (p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>) also dates from the earliest
period. Above the dikkeh are remains of the original timber ceiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>A prayer-recess in the fourth series of arcades dates from 1094.
The pulpit, now bereft of its sumptuous incrustation, the wooden
dome in front of the mihrâb, the plaster windows in the mihrâb
wall, and also the dome in the court are all additions by the Mameluke
sultan Melek el-Mansûr Lagîn (1296–1308).</p>

<p class='c016'>The peculiar minaret in the great quadrangle, of which the square
basement only was originally built of stone, offers a splendid *<span class='sc'>View</span> of
the vast city. We look down the Nile, to the N., to the Delta, and to
the W. and S.W. we see the Pyramids.</p>

<p class='c009'>The small <i>Medreseh Serghatmash</i> (Pl. D, 7) in Shâria el-Khedeiri,
on the N. side of Ibn Tulûn’s mosque, built by a mameluke
of sultan Hasan in the style of Hasan’s mosque (see below) in 1357,
is interesting on account of its original unaltered dome.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now turn to the E., past the effective marble <i>Sebîl of the
Mother of Abbâs I.</i> (1849–54), and through the Shâria es-Salîbeh
(Pl. D, 6) and the Shâria Shekhûn (Pl. D, E, 6), to the <span class='sc'>Place Rumeileh</span>
(Pl. E, 6; tramway No. 6, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>), the starting-place of the
Mecca caravans.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of this square, and at the end of the Shâria Mohammed
Ali (p. <a href='#Page_450'>450</a>), rise the modern <i>Gâmia Rifaîyeh</i> (Pl. E, 6),
of the reign of the khedive Ismaîl (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>), and the famous—</p>

<p class='c011'>**<b>Gâmia Sultân Hasan</b> (Pl. E, 6), the grandest medreseh
in Egypt, erected for the Mameluke Hasan en-Nâsir (1347–61)
probably by a Syrian architect. It rises on a shelving rock opposite
the Citadel (p. <a href='#Page_453'>453</a>). The cruciform medreseh has been skilfully
adapted to the precincts, an irregular pentagon, about 9470 sq. yds.
in area.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief *Portal, 85 ft. high, whose side-pillars were originally
to have borne two minarets, recall the Seljuk buildings of
Konia. The façades terminate in a projecting stalactite cornice,
crowned with modern pinnacles, and the walls are relieved by blind
niches with round-arched windows in pairs. Over the detached
mausoleum, which projects from the S.E. façade, rises a dome
181 ft. high, restored in 1616 in the Arabian-Turkish style, but
said to have been originally egg-shaped. The minaret of 267 ft.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>at the S. angle of the medreseh, is the loftiest in Cairo, and after
that of the Kutubia at Marakesh the highest in N. Africa.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Interior</span> (undergoing restoration). The old court of ablutions on the
N.W. side of the building is again in use. The chief portal of the medreseh
leads into a vestibule with a stalactite dome. We then pass through
a second vestibule and a corridor to the main quadrangle, 38½ by 35 yds.,
containing the ruinous <i>meidâ</i>, or basin for ablutions, and a Turkish fountain
(<i>hanefîyeh</i>), both disused. The four lîwâns, with their massive
barrel-vaulting, are entered from the court by lofty marble portals, and
are in this exceptional case all used as halls of prayer. The four small
medresehs in the angles of the outer precincts, each with its court and
lîwân, served as lecture-rooms and dwellings.</p>

<p class='c022'>The sanctuary, 76 ft. in height, is adorned with a *Frieze bearing
an inscription in Cufic (or old Arabic) characters, carved in stucco on a
beautiful groundwork of arabesques. The wall of the mihrâb is richly
decorated with marble. Of the once sumptuous furnishings the mimbar
(pulpit), the dikkeh (reading-stand), and the wire-chains of the countless
lamps (see p. <a href='#Page_451'>451</a>) and candelabra are now the sole relics.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the right of the pulpit a bronze door, inlaid with gold and silver,
leads into the sultan’s *Mausoleum, a domed chamber of 23 yds. square,
92 ft. in height. The only remains of the original dome are the wooden
spandrels of the stalactites. The inscriptions on the wooden frieze are
in the round characters (naskhi) used since the time of Saladin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Citadel</b> (Pl. E, F, 6; ‘El-Kala’), commanding the city but
itself overtopped by the Mokattam hills (p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>), was built by
Saladin after 1166, in connection with the third town-wall (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>),
on the model of the Crusaders’ castles in Syria. The only remains
of that building are the E. outer wall and several towers in the
interior. The palaces of the Aiyubides (1171–1250), already half
in ruins when Selim I. entered the city (1517), have entirely disappeared.
The first restoration of the fortress dates from the reign
of El-Ghûri (1501–16).</p>

<p class='c011'>The direct way to the Citadel from the Place Rumeileh is by
a street beyond the huge gate-tower <i>Bâb el-Azab</i> (Pl. E, 6), where
the Mameluke leaders were shot by order of Mohammed Ali (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>)
in 1811. The chief approaches, ascending from the broad Shâria
el-Maghar (Pl. E, 6), are the Shâria Bâb el-Gedîd and the Shâria
ed-Defterkhâneh. The latter, for foot-passengers only, passes the
S. side of the <i>Defterkhâneh</i> (Pl. F, 6; state-archives). The <i>Bâb
el-Gedid</i> (Pl. F, 6; ‘new gate’) leads into the outer court of the
Citadel. We then pass through the <i>Bâb el-Wastâni</i> (‘middle gate’)
into the main court, where the ‘alabaster mosque’ faces us and the
mosque of Nâsir rises on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Gâmia en-Nâsir</b> (Pl. F, 6), built by En-Nâsir (p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>) in
1317, later used as a military storehouse and a prison, has now
been cleared out, but may be seen by leave of the British military
authorities. The fortress-like façade, and the portals in particular,
show traces of Romanesque influence. The peculiar minarets, with
their bulbous domes, are adorned with coloured fayence in the Persian
style. The finest columns in the court are Byzantine; others are
antique. The sadly disfigured lîwâns still retain their old coloured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>fretwork ceiling. The dome in front of the prayer-niche, which
has collapsed with the exception of its drum, rests on ancient Egyptian
granite columns, as in the mosque of Merdani (p. <a href='#Page_450'>450</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Gâmia Mohammed Ali</b> (Pl. E, F, 6), known as the
‘alabaster mosque’ from the building-material chiefly used, was
begun by Mohammed Ali in 1824 but completed only in 1857 by
his successor Saîd. The architect was the Greek <i>Yûsuf Boshna</i> of
Constantinople, who built it on the model of the Nuri Osmanieh
mosque (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>) with a staff of Greek workmen. The tall and unduly
slender minarets form one of the chief landmarks of Cairo. The
forecourt, with its hanefîyeh (fountain with taps), is flanked with
arcades. The *Sanctuary, a domed Byzantine hall, borne by four
square pillars, is grandly proportioned and beautifully lighted. To
the left of the entrance is Mohammed Ali’s tomb (d. 1849).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the S.W. wall of the Citadel, opposite the <i>Viceregal
Palace</i>, we enjoy, especially towards evening, a magnificent *View
of the city with its countless minarets and domes. To the N. and
W. are the windmill-hills and the green plains watered by the
Nile. To the W. rise the Pyramids of Gîzeh.</p>

<p class='c016'>The view is far grander from the **<b>Mokattam Hills</b>, or <i>Gebel Giyûshi</i>,
a fine standpoint being the conspicuous <i>Gâmia Giyûshi</i>, a Fatimite
mosque (1085), reached in ½ hr. from the Bâb el-Gebel (Pl. F, 6), the
‘hill-gate’ of the citadel. A side-path to the right leads to the <i>Convent
of the Bektashi</i> (Turkish dervishes), picturesquely situated on the bare
hill-side.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the <i>Bâb el-Attaba</i> (Bâb el-Atabeg; Pl. F, 5), the N. gate of the
Citadel, we proceed past the cemetery <i>Karâfet Bâb el-Wezîr</i> (Pl. F, 5)
to the Mameluke tombs (comp. p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>c. The New Town.</h4>

<p class='c021'>To the W. of the Ezbekîyeh Garden and the Place de l’Opéra
(p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), to the W. also of the fashionable Shâria Kâmel (Pl B, C, 2,
3) and of the Shâria Abdîn (Pl. C, 3, 4), lie the new <b>Ismaîlîyeh</b> and
<b>Tewfîkîyeh</b> quarters, extending to the Nile and the <i>Ismaîlîyeh
Canal</i>, the latter quarter, named after Tewfik (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>), being the
most recent. They contain several of the large hotels, most of the
ministerial and consular offices, the chief banks, and many palaces
of wealthy European, Levantine, and Egyptian magnates.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ismaîlîyeh and Tewfîkîyeh are separated by the broad and busy
<span class='sc'>Shâria Bûlâk</span> (Pl. B, A, 3; tramway No. 6, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>), which leads from
the Ezbekîyeh Garden to the Abu’l-Eileh Bridge (Pl. A, 3) and
<i>Bûlâk</i>. From October to December the banks of the Nile present a
very busy scene, the state of the river being then most favourable
for the goods-traffic from Upper Egypt, Nubia, and the fertile Delta.—Steam-ferry
to <i>Gezîreh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_457'>457</a>; bridge now being built).</p>

<p class='c011'>The direct way to the Nile is by the <span class='sc'>Shâria Kasr en-Nîl</span>
(Pl. C-A, 3, 4), diverging from the Shâria Abdîn to the S. of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>Place de l’Opéra. It crosses the round Mîdân Suleimân Bâsha and
ends at the Mîdân Mariette Bâsha (Pl. A, 4), near the <i>Egyptian
Museum</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the S. is the <span class='sc'>Mîdân Ismaîlîyeh</span> (Pl. A, 4, 5; tramway
No. 4, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>). On the S. side of it runs the Shâria el-Kubri,
to the W., to the Great Nile Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_457'>457</a>), while from it to the S.
stretches the long Shâria Kasr el-Aïni (Pl. A, 5, 6). In the latter
street, immediately to the left, is the free <b>Egyptian University</b>
(Pl. A, 5), founded in 1908, the purpose of which, in contrast to
the old Gâmia el-Azhar (p. <a href='#Page_447'>447</a>), is to offer Mohammedans a liberal
modern education. Farther on, to the left, opposite the handsome
houses built on the site of the palace <i>Kasr ed-Dubara</i>, are the
<i>Ministries of Public Works and War</i> (Pl. A, B, 5) and the building
of the <i>Sudan Agency</i>; on the N. side of the grounds is the <i>Geological
Museum</i>.—Still farther to the S. the street is prolonged by the
Shâria Fum el-Khalîg (Pl. A, 7), leading past the native (Government)
hospital <i>Kasr el-Aïni</i> (Pl. A, 7) and close to the narrow
<i>E. Arm of the Nile</i> (Bahr el-Khalîg), opposite the island of Rôda
(p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>), to <i>Old Cairo</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Egyptian Museum</b> (Pl. A, 4; <i>El-Antikkhâneh</i>) is now
housed in a new building (1897–1902) in the Shâria Mariette Bâsha,
near the Great Nile Bridge. The collection, the greatest of its kind,
founded in 1857 by the French Egyptologist Aug. Mariette (1821–81),
consists of Egyptian and Græco-Roman antiquities found in the
Nile Valley. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_442'>442</a>. Director, M. G. Maspero.</p>

<p class='c016'>The two long colonnades adjoining the vestibule, are destined for casts.
They terminate in two pavilions, containing, on the left, the Library
and, on the right, the office for the sale of duplicates, photographs, and
scientific publications.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Ground Floor</span> contains the large stone monuments, including the
sarcophagi in the Grande Galerie d’Honneur, beyond the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the W. (left) wing of the Grande Galerie we first enter, to the
right, Rooms A-D, containing memorials of the Old Empire (3rd–6th Dynasties;
about B.C. 2900–2350). Noteworthy among the master-works in
Room B are: *74. Wooden statue of a man, known as the Sheikh el-Beled

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Upper Floor</span> contains the smaller antiquities, the objects found
in the royal tombs of Thebes in Upper Egypt, and the mummies.</p>

<p class='c022'>We begin with the Great Gallery, where the coffins and mummies
of priests of Ammon are exhibited.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the Salon Méridional, adjoining the central court, and (to the
right) in Rooms A and B, are vessels, implements, toilet requisites, musical
instruments, lamps, candlesticks, candelabra etc.; in Case G of the South

<p class='c022'>Room P, with its rich collection of *Trinkets, illustrating the development
of the Egyptian goldsmiths’ art from the earliest age down to
the Byzantine period (A.D. 395–640). Case IV, B, in a recess on the right,
contains jewellery found at Abydos in Upper Egypt (bracelets from the
tomb of king Zer, 1st Dyn.), dating from the earliest period, and already
showing a high degree of skill. To the Middle Empire belong the *Tomb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>Treasures of Dahshûr (p. <a href='#Page_464'>464</a>; trinkets of princess Khnumet, etc.), in the
centre of the room, showing the Egyptian goldsmiths’ art in its highest
perfection. Admirably executed are also the *Trinkets of queen Ahhotep,
mother of king Amosis, the Hyksos conqueror (1580 B.C.; p. <a href='#Page_455'>455</a>), of the
New Empire (niche on the right, case IV, G-M.). The 20th and 21st
Dynasties also are represented by treasures from Bubastis (p. <a href='#Page_439'>439</a>; Case XII).
The extensive collection of Græco-Roman and Byzantine jewellery, partly
pure Greek in style, partly of ancient Egyptian pattern, also merit notice.
To the former class belongs notably, in a niche to the left (stands VII, X),
the *Treasure of Tukh el-Karâmûs, of the early Ptolemaic era (about
300 B.C.).</p>

<p class='c022'>Gallery Q (continuation of Gallery O) and Rooms R-U contain *Mummies
of the kings of the New Empire, from the ravine Deir el-Bahri near
Thebes. In Gallery Q: 1187. Mummy of Merenptah, son and successor of

Furnishings from the tombs of Thutmosis III. (p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>) and Amenophis II,
(B.C. 1447–1420); wooden figures, boxes, shrouds, wigs, etc.—Room T:
*Coffins and furnishings from the tomb of the parents-in-law of Amenophis

Dyn.), with tattooed body.—Room D′: Relics of the earliest period, mostly
from the royal tombs at Abydos (see p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Great Nile Bridge</b> (Pl. A, 5; Arabic <i>Kubri Kasr en-Nîl</i>),
427 yds. long, at the end of Shâria el-Kubri (p. <a href='#Page_455'>455</a>), connects
the new town with Gezîreh. It is usually opened from about 1.30
to 3 p.m. for the passage of vessels (see notices).</p>

<p class='c011'>The island <i>Gezîret Bûlâk</i>, or simply <b>Gezîreh</b> (‘island’), is the
favourite residence of the fashionable world. The *<i>Park</i> (café near
the bridge) at the S. end is much frequented, especially in the afternoon,
and is skirted by a pleasant drive shaded by lebbakh-trees.
Passing the <i>Race Course</i> and the grounds of the Khedivial Sporting
Club, we reach the N. part of the island with its handsome villas,
the <i>Ghezîreh Palace Hotel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>; built by Franz Pasha in 1863–4
as a viceregal palace), and the interesting <i>Aquarium</i> (8.30 to
5 o’cl., 2 pias.; Frid. 5 pias.).—Steam-ferry to <i>Bûlâk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From Gezîreh a road crosses the sometimes dry W. arm of the
Nile, above the so-called English Bridge, and leads to the S. to the
village of Gîzeh (tramways Nos. 3 &#38; 5, see p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>). On the right,
beyond the <i>Gîza Garden</i>, is the <i>Polytechnic School</i>. Farther on,
opposite Rôda (p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>), is the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Zoological Garden</b> (adm. ½ pias.; on Sun. afternoon, when a
band plays, 5 pias.), containing many Egyptian and Sudanese animals
and an aquarium. The grounds, 50 acres in area, with their superb
royal palms (Oreodoxa regia) and pond for aquatic flowers, are
in themselves worth seeing.</p>

  <h4 class='c023'>d. Environs.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'><b>1.</b> The *<b>Mameluke Tombs</b>, to the E. of the old town, erroneously
called the <i>Tombs of the Caliphs</i> (comp. F, 3, 4), date mostly
from the second Mameluke dynasty (pp. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>, 445). They are most
easily reached, on donkey-back (p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>), from the Bâb en-Nasr
(Pl. E, 2; p. <a href='#Page_449'>449</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing a large <i>Moslem Cemetery</i> (Pl. E, F, 2) we come first
to the N.E. group of the tombs, all much ruined. These are the
<i>Tomb Mosque of Emîr el-Kebîr</i>, son of Bars Bey (p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>), the
*<i>Monastery Mosque of Sultan Melek el-Ashraf Inâl</i> (1453–68),
an irregular quadrangle of 115 by 51 yds., with a fine minaret and
dome, and the cubical <i>Tomb of an Emir of El-Ghûri</i> (p. <a href='#Page_449'>449</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now turn to the S. to visit the *<i>Monastery Mosque of Sultan
Barkûk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>), partly restored of late. It forms a square of
80 yds. each way. The two handsome minarets have been deprived
of their bulb-like summits. In front of the mihrâb is a small dome.
Of the two mausoleums that on the N. was built in 1400–5 by
Barkûk’s sons Farag and Azîz; that on the S., together with the
monastery (Khânkâ), was completed by Farag in 1410.</p>

<p class='c016'>The old chief portal, with its stalactite niche, is on the N. side.
To the right of it is a sebîl with an elegant kuttâb (p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>). On the left
are the ruins of the three-storied monastery and a dilapidated hall connecting
the monastery with the tomb of Barkûk’s father, Sharaf ed-Dîn
Anas (d. 1382).</p>

<p class='c022'>From the present entrance in the outbuilding at the S.W. angle we
pass through a vestibule and a corridor to the quadrangle (sahn) with
its fountain (hanefîyeh). The lîwâns, borne by pillars, are roofed with
flat domes, some of which have fallen in. The beautifully proportioned
sanctuary, with nave and two aisles, contains three plain prayer-recesses
and a stone *Pulpit presented by Kâït Bey (1483; see below). Large double
portals lead to the left to the mausoleum of Barkûk and his sons, and
to the right to the tombs of the ladies of the family.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within a walled court a little to the W. are the <i>Tombs of
Emirs Suleimân ibn Selîm</i> (d. 1526) and <i>Ahmed</i>. The dome of
the former is richly adorned with trellis-work set in lozenge-shaped
meshes, and shows remains of the inscribed frieze of blue fayence.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes’ walk to the S.W., past the large flattened dome
of the Turkish <i>Mabed er-Rifaîyeh</i>, brings us to the <i>Hôsh of Kâït
Bey</i> (1468–96), once 330 yds. long, the largest family burial-place
at Cairo, now occupied by a whole village. A dilapidated dwelling-house
(rab), 86 yds. long, and trough, and the tomb-mosque still exist.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Tomb Mosque of Kâït Bey</i>, the finest of all the Mameluke
tombs, at once strikes the eye with its wall decoration in coloured
stripes, the delicate network of the dome of the mausoleum,
and the graceful minaret, 131 ft. high. Between the minaret and
the railed-in sebîl is the chief portal with its trefoil arch, leading
into a vestibule containing the throne of the sultan. The adjoining
sanctuary, with its pavement in coloured mosaic, its two inscription-friezes,
its kamarîyehs, and stained-glass windows, has been almost
entirely renewed. The mimbar or pulpit also is modern. The lîwân
opposite still has its fine old timber ceiling. The mausoleum, on
the S.W. side of the sanctuary, also shows great wealth of colouring.
A colonnade adjacent contains the tombs of the sultan’s four wives.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>We now follow the Shâria es-Sultân Ahmed and (to the right)
Shâria Karâfet el-Mamalik, cross the so-called <i>Windmill Hill</i>
(Pl. F, 3), the central great mound of débris on the E. side of the
old town, and thus regain the Fatimite city (Shâria esh-Sharawâni,
p. <a href='#Page_446'>446</a>). On the way, from the ‘Point de Vue’ marked on the Plan,
we have a fine *View of the city of tombs and the Mokattam Hills
behind us.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Shâria Karâfet Bâb el-Wezîr, the S. prolongation of Shâria es-Sultân
Ahmed, leads to the <i>Citadel</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_453'>453</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><b>2.</b> <span class='sc'>Excursion to the Heliopolis Oasis and Heliopolis-On.</span>
The new <i>Heliopolis Oasis</i> is most quickly (10 min.) reached from
Cairo by the Metropolitan Railway (p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>), or by railway and
electric tramway viâ <i>Palais de Koubbeh</i> (20–30 min.; comp.
below); tramway No. 10 in ca. 50 min., see p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>; cab, see p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Heliopolis Oasis</b> or <i>New Heliopolis</i> (hotels, see p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>),
called by the Arabs <i>Masr el-Gedida</i>, <i>i. e.</i> ‘New Cairo’, is a new
‘suburb’, founded in 1906 by a Belgian company, about 5 M. to the
N.E. of Cairo. On this healthy site an entirely modern town, consisting
of villas and buildings mostly in the Moorish style, is being
laid out on an ambitious scale. Broad avenues planted with trees
and streets pleasantly interspersed with spacious squares intersect
the town, while recreation grounds of every description and a race
course provide for the residents’ entertainment.—Heliopolis Oasis
is connected with Cairo by a beautiful <i>Avenue</i> (cab, see p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>),
the favourite promenade of the inhabitants and visitors in Cairo,
which, close to the Oasis, passes the not yet completed <i>British
Barracks</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The visit to <span class='sc'>Heliopolis-On</span> may be combined with the route just
described by way of rail. station <i>Palais de Koubbeh</i> (tramway, see below).
If, however, we make our visit from Cairo direct we go by railway from the
Pont Limûn Station (p. <a href='#Page_439'>439</a>; trains every ½ hr., in 21 min.; also several
fast trains in ¼ hr.; return-fare 4½ or 3 pias.).</p>

<p class='c022'>The train crosses the <i>Ismaîlîyeh Canal</i> (p. <a href='#Page_438'>438</a>). 2 M. <i>Demîrdash</i>, or
<i>Demerdache</i>, station for the villa-suburb of <i>Abbâsîyeh</i>. 4¼ M. <i>Palais de
Koubbeh</i>, with the Khedivial Palace; from the station an electric tramway,
in connection with the trains, runs to the S.E. to (1 M.) the <i>Heliopolis
Oasis</i> (see above). 5 M. <i>Ezbet ez-Zeitûn</i>, a group of villas; 6¼ M.
<i>Matarîyeh</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>At the village of <i>Matarîyeh</i> (hotel), in a garden to the right of the
road, is the <i>Virgin’s Tree</i>, a sycamore marking the spot where the Holy
Family is said to have resided during their exile in Egypt. A little to
the E. of the station is an <i>Ostrich Farm</i> (adm. 10 pias.), with a belvedere.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the Virgin’s Garden the Shâria el-Misalleh (obelisk street) leads
to the N. to the site of <b>Heliopolis-On</b>, one of tho most ancient places
in Egypt, famous for the cult of the falcon-headed sun-god Rē-Harakhtē.
The <i>Obelisk</i> of red granite is the oldest in the land. Scanty fragments
of the temple and of the town-wall are the only other ruins.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>3. We may next visit <b>Old Cairo</b> (tramway No. 4, p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The route is by the <span class='sc'>Shâria Masr el-Kadîmeh</span>, the continuation
of Shâria Fum el-Khalîg (Pl. A, 7; p. <a href='#Page_455'>455</a>). On the left, at its beginning,
is a hexagonal <i>Water Tower</i>, which once supplied an
<i>Aqueduct</i> (El-Kanâtir) built by El-Ghûri (p. <a href='#Page_449'>449</a>), extending to Bâb
el-Karâfeh (Pl. E, 7), and still traceable in its ruins, 66 ft. high.</p>

<p class='c011'>About ¼ M. beyond the new Abbâs Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>) the Shâria
Gâmia Amr, on the left, leads to the picturesque old Coptic convent
<i>Deir Abû Sefein</i> and the Amru Mosque (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the tramway-terminus in the poor little town of <i>Old Cairo</i>
(Masr el-Kadîmeh, p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>) we follow the street to the Gîzeh steam-ferry
(p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>), turn to the left past the police-station, and in the
Shâria es-Saghîr to the left again. This brings us to <i>St. Georges</i>,
a station on the Helwân railway (see p. <a href='#Page_439'>439</a>). On the E. side of
the railway is the site of—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Babylon</b> (p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>), a Roman castle, of which the only remains
are parts of the outer walls and a <i>Gateway</i>, on the S.W. side, with
two projecting towers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the precincts of the ancient fortress now lies <i>Kasr esh-Shama</i>,
a village inhabited chiefly by Copts, with a synagogue, five
mediæval Coptic churches (<i>El-Moallaka</i>, <i>Abu Sergeh</i>, etc.), and
the Greek <i>Convent of St. George</i> (W. side). One of the entrances
is between the convent and an old tower.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the N.E. angle of the fortress, skirting the rubbish-mounds
of <i>Fostât</i> (p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>), we reach (10 min.) the Amru Mosque, surrounded
by cemeteries and potteries, where the porous kullehs are made, and
conspicuous by its red and white striped façade.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Gâmia Amr ibn el-Âsî</b>, commonly called the <i>Amru
Mosque</i> by Europeans, is named after the general of caliph Omar
(p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>). It was originally a small edifice built in 642, probably
of crude bricks, but it was repeatedly rebuilt or restored, as in 698
and 827, and notably by Saladin in 1172, after the invasion of king
Amalarich of Jerusalem and the burning of Fostât in 1168. Other
restorations took place in the three following centuries. The two
minarets are modern.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span>, a slightly irregular rectangle, 132 by 108 yds., though
sadly ruinous, is of impressive dimensions. The six-aisled sanctuary
contains 21 series of arcades (with pointed arches) running towards the
kibla (prayer niche facing Mecca). The three outer rows of columns on
each side are continued by those of the N.E. and the S.W. lîwâns, of
which, however, the bases alone remain. The lîwân on the side of the
quadrangle next the entrance has a single arcade only. The Roman and
Byzantine columns from Memphis (p. <a href='#Page_464'>464</a>), once 366 in number it is said,
have been utilized without regard to symmetry or congruity.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the centre of the court, now planted with trees, is a hanefîyeh
(18th cent.). In the N. angle of the sanctuary is an uninteresting monument
over the supposed tomb of Sheikh Abdallah, son of Amr, erected by
Abbâs I. (1849–54). On the almost intact S.W. wall of the sanctuary are
curious wood-carvings, still purely Byzantine (9th cent.).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span><b>4.</b> The <span class='sc'>Pyramids of Gîzeh</span> should be visited on a calm and
clear day, as the sand-drift is most trying in windy weather.
(Umbrella or dark-coloured spectacles advisable to protect the eyes
from the glare.) The excursion takes at least 4 hrs., or, including
Sakkâra, a whole day. Those who are pressed for time visit the
Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, and the Granite Temple only. (Tramway
No. 1, see p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>; carr. in 1–1¼ hr., p. <a href='#Page_441'>441</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The tramway diverges at Old Cairo (p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>), about 770 yds. to
the S. of the Water Tower, to the right from line No. 4, and crosses
a branch of the Nile to the island of <b>Rôda</b> (<i>Gezîret Rôda</i>), at the
S. end of which is the old <i>Nilometer</i> (Arabic Mikyâs), dating from
the time of the Omaiyade caliph Suleimân (716), but often restored
since.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next cross the main channel of the Nile by the <i>Pont Abbâs II.</i>
(opened 10–11 a.m. and 3.30 to 4.30 p.m. for the passage of vessels)
to the village of <b>Gîzeh</b> (Tues. market), at the N. end of which,
about 550 yds. below the steam-ferry (p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>), our tramway joins
the branch from Gezîreh (p. <a href='#Page_457'>457</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the Nile, and passing a station on the Upper Egyptian
railway (p. <a href='#Page_463'>463</a>), we still have a run of 5 M., nearly due W., to the
Pyramids, the huge angular forms of which gradually become more
distinct and soon stand out in clear outlines.</p>

<p class='c011'>The terminus of the tramway is near the large <i>Mena House
Hotel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_440'>440</a>), on the N.E. border of the <i>Libyan Desert</i>. Adjacent
is a Greek restaurant. The road then ascends in a curve to the
(½ M.) plateau of the Pyramids.</p>

<p class='c016'>Near the tramway-terminus is a station for donkeys and camels (5 pias.
per hour; see also pp. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>, 174).—The plateau is open to the public and
may be quite well explored without a guide. <span class='sc'>Tickets</span> of admittance to
the monuments themselves are sold at a stall next to the <i>Viceregal Kiosque</i>,
at the N.E. corner of the Great Pyramid. Guides (Bedouins) also are
obtained here on application to their sheikh (recognizable by the rosette
on his breast). Ticket for the ascent of the Great Pyramid 10 pias. (for
the interior, also 10 pias.); for the other monuments 5 pias.; for the entire
expedition, including the ascent of the Great Pyramid and the visit to its
interior, 20 pias.—Bakshîsh optional, but it is usual to give a few piastres.
No attention should be paid to beggars or to vendors of ‘antiquities’. Unofficial
guides who try to thrust themselves on visitors should be repelled,
with the aid of the police if need be.</p>

<p class='c009'>The **<b>Pyramids of Gîzeh</b> form the second and most imposing
of the six groups of pyramids extending along the border of the
Libyan desert, in a line of about 19 M. in length. To the N.W. is
the <i>Abu Roâsh</i> group, towards the S.E. are the groups of <i>Zâwyet el-Aryân</i>,
<i>Abusîr</i> (p. <a href='#Page_464'>464</a>), <i>Sakkâra</i> (p. <a href='#Page_464'>464</a>), and <i>Dahshûr</i> (p. <a href='#Page_464'>464</a>).
The Arabs call them <i>ahrâm</i> (sing, <i>háram</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Pyramids of Gîzeh, creations of the 4th Dynasty (about
B.C. 2850 to 2700), rank among the oldest monuments of human industry,
and their colossal proportions extort from us to-day the same
astonishment that was felt in antiquity by Greek and Roman travellers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>We marvel both at the technical skill shown by the Egyptians
in their construction, and at the might of the kings, who must have
had the services of many thousands of their subjects at command.
The pyramids are believed to have been built in layers. Each king
at his accession began to erect his tomb-pyramid on a small scale.
If wealthy or long-lived he enlarged the original design, and after
his death the outer covering was added.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Great Pyramid</b>, erected by Kheops or Cheops, the
Khufu of the Egyptians, was called by them <i>Yekhwet Khufu</i> (the
‘glorious place of Khufu’). Herodotus (II, 125) states that 100,000
men were employed for three months every year in building it.
The outer covering, with the exception of a few fragments on the
base below the entrance, has disappeared. Each side is now 248 yds.
in length (originally 255 yds.). The perpendicular height is 450 ft.
(once, to the apex, 480 ft.). The sides rise at an angle of 51°50′.
The solid content of the masonry, deducting the nucleus of rock
and the chambers in the interior, was formerly about 3,302,500
(and is still about 3,081,100) cubic yards. This stupendous structure
is composed of yellowish limestone blocks, quarried in the
vicinity and containing numerous fossils, chiefly nummulites (a
kind of snail-shell), while the incrustation consisted of blocks of
a finer white limestone from the Mokattam quarries.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Ascent</span> of the Pyramid, though free from danger, is very toilsome.
The visitor is helped up the steps, mostly 3 ft. high, by three Bedouins,
two holding his hands and the third pushing behind. We may reach the
top, a platform of 11 yds. square, in 10–15 min., but a more leisurely
ascent is advisable. The *View of the yellow sands and bare rocks of
the great desert-plateau, on which rise the Sphinx, the smaller pyramids
of Gîzeh, and the more distant tombs stretching as far as Dahshûr, awakens
solemn thoughts of death and eternity. At our feet stretches a tract of
rich arable land, luxuriantly clothed with blue-green vegetation and entirely
inundated in autumn. To the E., beyond the glittering river, rise
the citadel of Cairo and the warmly-coloured Mokattam hills.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span> of the Pyramid will not interest ordinary travellers.
The air in the passages, hall, and tomb-chamber is hot and stifling and
makes the visit very disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the E. side of the Great Pyramid, where a <i>Temple</i> for
the cult of the dead once stood, we walk past the <i>Three Small
Pyramids</i> of relatives of Kheops to the Sphinx, which rises from
the sand of the desert some 350 yds. to the S.E.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Sphinx</b>, the most famous monument in this vast burial-ground,
probably once a natural rock, has the form of a recumbent
lion with the head of a king (Khephren?), wearing a head-cloth
adorned with the royal serpent. In front of the breast is the
image of a god, much weather-worn. The head also is sadly mutilated,
the nose and beard have broken off, and the reddish tint
which once enlivened the face has almost entirely disappeared. But
in spite of all injuries the monument preserves a striking expression
of strength and majesty. The eyes have a pensive, faraway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>look, the lips wear a half-smile, and the whole face is of
graceful and beautiful type. The height of the monument, from the
pavement on which the fore-legs of the lion rest to the crown of
the head is about 66 ft.; its length, from the lion’s fore-paws to the
root of the tail, is about 186 ft. On the top of the head is a cavity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some 48 yds. to the S.E. of the Sphinx are the remains of
the *<b>Granite Temple</b>, or <i>Sphinx Temple</i>, a large building of
hewn stone. It was once the sacred entrance through which the
Pyramid of Khephren (see below) was approached from the valley
below. The edifice is a fine example of majestic simplicity, and the
very hard stone has been treated with marvellous skill. The exterior
of the temple is buried in rubbish. The two main halls are rectangular,
and the beams of their ceilings rested on granite pillars.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Circuit of the Pyramid Plateau</span> (1½–2 hrs.) is interesting.
From the Great Pyramid we walk to the W. to the great <b>Burial Ground</b>
of the relatives and officials of the royal family, as well as of the priests
and officials of the temples of the dead. The square tombs (<i>mastabas</i>)
are ranged in straight lines like streets, affording a good example of an
Egyptian necropolis. On the way we pass the Tomb of <i>Shepses-kef-onekh</i>,
dating from the 5th Dynasty (about 2700–2550 B.C.).</p>

<p class='c022'>Through a cleft in the rock, near the <i>Quarry</i> which yielded the stone
in the reign of Ramses II. for the temple of Heliopolis (p. <a href='#Page_459'>459</a>), we descend
to the artificially levelled plateau of the—</p>

<p class='c022'><b>Second Pyramid</b>, Egyp. <i>Wer-Khefrē</i> (‘great is Khefrē‘), built by
Khephren (Khefrē). Standing on higher ground, it looks larger than the
Pyramid of Kheops. Its perpendicular height is 447 (once 454) ft.; each
side is 230 (formerly 235) yds. in length; its sides rise at an angle of
52°20′. The masonry has a solid content of 2,173,552 (once 2,445,377) cub. yds.</p>

<p class='c022'>The foundations of the <i>Temple of the Dead</i>, on the E. side of the
pyramid, were excavated in 1908. On the W. side of the pyramid we
observe an <i>Inscription</i> and several <i>Rock Tombs</i>. Adjacent is a mummy
shaft (caution advisable).</p>

<p class='c022'>The road now leads to the S.W. to the <b>Third Pyramid</b>, Egyp.
<i>Neter-Menkewrē</i> (‘divine is Menkewrē‘), built by Menkewrē, the Mykerinos
of Herodotus. Its perpendicular height is 204 (once 218) ft., while its
sides rise at an angle of 51°; each side of the base measures 118 yds. The
stones are unusually large. To the S. rise <i>Three Small Pyramids</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>We next walk to the remains of the <i>Temple of the Dead</i> to the E.
of the third pyramid and then follow the ancient paved track by which
the stones were once brought up from the Nile valley. On the way,
among several <i>Rock Tombs</i>, are the ruins of an unfinished pyramid. Passing
a very ruinous family burial-place of the 26th Dynasty, called <i>Campbell’s
Tomb</i> after its discoverer, we now descend to the <i>Granite Temple</i>
(see above), and walk to the N.W., past the <i>Sphinx</i> (p. <a href='#Page_462'>462</a>), to the <i>Three
Small Pyramids</i> (p. <a href='#Page_462'>462</a>) near the Pyramid of Kheops.</p>

<p class='c022'>Lastly we may visit the <i>Rock Tombs</i> of the Ancient Empire, near
the Arab village <i>Kafr el-Hâram</i>. The best-known, the ‘<i>Tomb of Numbers</i>‘,
contains badly preserved reliefs (counting of cattle).</p>

<p class='c009'><b>5.</b> The <span class='sc'>Excursion to Memphis and Sakkâra</span> is easily made
in one day. Provisions (supplied by the hotels in lieu of déjeuner),
candles (obtainable also at Bedrashein), and if possible an acetylene
lamp should be taken. We start early from the chief station (first
train usually at 7 a.m.) by the Upper Egyptian line for <i>Bedrashein</i>
(1 hr.; fare 16½ or 8½ pias.), where donkeys are in waiting (to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>Sakkâra and back 10 pias.; bargain should be made in presence of
the Bedouin sheikh). The ride back takes fully 1½ hr. (train for
Cairo at present 4.56 p.m.). Tickets for the monuments (5 pias.)
are sold by the custodians or at <i>Mariette’s House</i> (p. <a href='#Page_465'>465</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'>Robust travellers may ride from Sakkâra along the margin of the
desert, or viâ the pyramids of <i>Abusîr</i>, in 2½–3 hrs. to the <i>Mena House
Hotel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>). The charge (15–20 pias.) should be agreed upon with the
donkey-boy at the Bedrashein station. In the reverse direction we may
go by tramway to Gîzeh (comp. p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>), and ride thence viâ the Pyramids
of Gîzeh to Sakkâra (donkey 20, camel 30 pias.; comp. pp. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>, 174). Or
we may drive in a desert-car (80 pias.) from Mena House Hotel along
the border of the desert to Sakkâra.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Railway</span>, passing <i>Bûlâk</i> (p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>), runs to the N.W. and
crosses the <i>Nile</i>. 2 M. <i>Embâbeh</i>, noted for the ‘battle of the
Pyramids’, in which Bonaparte defeated the Mamelukes in 1798.—Describing
a circuit the train next comes to (6¼ M.) <i>Bûlâk ed-Dakrûr</i>,
on a Nile canal. At (8 M.) <i>Gîzeh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>) we sight the
Pyramids (p. <a href='#Page_461'>461</a>) on the right, and then, on the left, Old Cairo
(p. <a href='#Page_460'>460</a>) and the long range of the Mokattam (p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>), continued to
the S.E. by <i>Gebel Turra</i>. Next, on the left, is <i>Gezîret Tirsâ</i>, an
island in the Nile.</p>

<p class='c011'>14½ M. <i>Abu Nemrûs.</i> On the right rise the hills bordering
the Libyan desert, with the pyramids of Abusîr. Beyond (17½ M.)
<i>El-Hawamdîyeh</i> the step-pyramid (p. <a href='#Page_465'>465</a>) is visible for a short
time. To the left, at the foot of Gebel Turra, lies <i>Helwân</i> (<i>Hélouan</i>),
a winter health-resort.</p>

<p class='c011'>20½ M. <b>Bedrashein</b>, on the E. side of the railway.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the railway-crossing we ride to the W., past the village
(Wed. market), by a road through green fields, which are entirely
flooded in autumn, to the (20 min.) palm-grove of Bedrashein.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the foreground, shaded by palms, lies the site of <b>Memphis</b>,
now a heap of débris, the oldest capital of Egypt, founded under
the name of ‘White Walls’ about 3400 B.C. by Menes, the first
historical king. The vast area of the ruins seems to have extended,
down to the 12th cent. A.D., as far as Gîzeh. The chief quarters of
the city probably lay on the fields of Bedrashein and <i>Mit-Rahîneh</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road forks 20 min. beyond Bedrashein. The <span class='sc'>Summer Route</span>,
impassable during the inundations, leads to the left in about 8 min.
to the two *<i>Colossal Statues of Ramses II.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>), both now
prostrate, which once stood at the entrance to the famous temple
of Ptah. The first is 25 ft., or including the crown 31½ ft., long;
the second, protected by a mud-hut (adm. 4 pias.), is 42 ft. in length.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now ride on, leaving the village of Mit Rahîneh at a little
distance to the right, towards the palm-grove of <i>Sakkâra</i>, at the
foot of the desert-plateau. On the yellow sand of the desert rise
eleven pyramids. To the extreme left (S.) is the necropolis of
<i>Dahshûr</i>, where the ‘blunted pyramid’ or ‘pyramid of the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>angles’ catches the eye. To the right (to the N.W. of the huts of
Sakkâra) rise the Onnos and step-pyramids (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning to the N. near Sakkâra, ½ hr. beyond the statues of
Ramses, and skirting the palm-grove, we ride towards the ruins of
some mud-built houses. The <span class='sc'>Winter Route</span> from the bifurcation
mentioned at p. <a href='#Page_464'>464</a> makes a long bend to the N. and leads through
the palm-grove of Bedrashein and past the ruins of the brick houses
of ancient Memphis; it then crosses a sluice-bridge, passes on either
side several ponds, and rejoins the summer route.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now ascend to the sandy plateau and overlook the *<b>Necropolis
of Sakkâra</b>. This vast area, about 4½ M. long from N.
to S. and from 550 to 1600 yds. in breadth from E. to W., has
afforded material for repeated exploration.</p>

<p class='c011'>We ride straight to the *<i>Step Pyramid</i> (Arab. El-Hâram el-Mudarrag),
the great landmark of Sakkâra. This was the tomb of
king Zoser (3rd Dynasty, about 2900–2850 B.C.), and is still older
than the pyramids of Gîzeh. It is 196 ft. high, and each step recedes
about 6½ ft.</p>

<p class='c016'>About 330 yds. to the S.W. of the Step Pyramid rises the <i>Pyramid
of King Onnos</i> (or Unis; about 2550 B.C.), which is easily scaled. The
view embraces all the pyramids from Dahshûr to Gîzeh. The central
chamber and burial-vault in the interior (shown by the custodian) are full
of hieroglyphic inscriptions, the oldest religious Egyptian text known.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the Step Pyramid, in the direction of Mariette’s House,
we suddenly obtain a striking view of the pyramids of Abusîr and
Gîzeh to the N.; in the palm-shaded Nile valley, bordered by the
yellowish-grey desert, we observe in the distance the mosque of
Mohammed Ali (p. <a href='#Page_454'>454</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>When the road forks we ride to the left to the <i>Mastaba of
Ptahhotep</i>, the tomb of the highest state-official of a king of the
5th Dynasty (about 2700–2550 B.C.). The interesting, delicately
executed wall-reliefs, like those of the almost contemporaneous
mastaba of Ti (p. <a href='#Page_466'>466</a>), are among the finest of the Ancient Empire
but are imperfectly lighted. The richest wall-decoration is in the
sacrificial chamber (funeral repast, rural scenes, etc.).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now repair to <i>Mariette’s House</i>, a little to the N., where
the famous Egyptologist lived during the excavations. We rest and
take luncheon on the terrace here. (Custodians 2½–5 pias.; Arabian
coffee provided if desired.)</p>

<p class='c011'>A few min. to the W. of Mariette’s house is the *<i>Serapeum</i>,
with the underground rock-tombs of the sacred bulls of the god Ptah.</p>

<p class='c016'>Apis, the sacred bull, had a temple of his own at Memphis, and after
death was buried with great pomp. He represented man in a future state
as identified with the god Osiris, and his tomb was a favourite goal of pilgrims.
Hermits too sometimes lived in the narrow cells of the tomb. After
Ptolemy I. had introduced the cult of Serapis (p. <a href='#Page_435'>435</a>) into Egypt, this
new god was identified with Osiris-Apis (Egyp. Oser-hapē, Gr. Osorapis).</p>

<p class='c022'>The temple over the Apis tombs has disappeared, and so too has a
second temple erected here by Nektanebos (358–341 B.C.), to which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>great sphinx avenue ascended from the plain below. The main passage
to the tombs, which was constructed by Psammetichos I. (663–609), is
now alone accessible. In the tomb-chambers are still preserved 24 of the
huge sarcophagi in which the mummies of the Apis bulls reposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The famous *<i>Mastaba of Ti</i>, to the N.E. of Mariette’s house,
is still deeply imbedded in the sand. This was the tomb of the
royal architect of king Nuserrē (5th Dyn.). The most beautiful of
the reliefs are in the tomb-chamber, which is entered from the road
through two vestibules and two passages. We note particularly, on
the E. wall, Harvest and Boat-building; on the S. wall, Sacrifices
to the dead; on the N. wall, *Scenes from life in the Delta marshes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who do not intend to ride on to Gîzeh may, on their way
back, glance at the <i>Tomb of Merekura</i>, of the early 6th Dynasty,
and at the <i>Street of Tombs</i> near it, of like date (including the <i>Tomb
of Enkhmē-Hor</i>, also called the ‘Tomb of the Physicians’, etc.)</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Jaffa</i>, Arabic <i>Yâfâ</i>, Gr. <i>Joppa</i> (pop. 47,000, viz. about
30,000 Moslems, 10,000 Christians, and 7000 Jews), originally a
Phœnician colony in the land of the Philistines, is mentioned as
early as the reign of Solomon (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>) as the seaport of Jerusalem.
The Maccabees (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>) brought it under Jewish domination. During
the Crusades it was repeatedly wrested from the Christians,
and in 1267 it was destroyed by the Mameluke sultan Beybars. In
1799 the town was stormed by the French under Kléber (p. <a href='#Page_444'>444</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The old town rises on a rock 118 ft. high, behind the <i>Quay</i>,
built towards the end of the 17th century. Its streets are very dusty
and in wet weather muddy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The quay and its prolongation, the main arteries of traffic, lead
in a curve towards the E. to the <i>Market</i> (Sûk), where the Semitic
type of the inhabitants is very noticeable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond this market is a public garden with a <i>Clock Tower</i>
erected by the town of Jaffa to commemorate the 25th year of the
reign of the now deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid (1876–1909), and
several Arabian cafés. The Gaza road leads thence to the right
through the S. suburb. The Jerusalem road leads straight on through
the new town and a number of orange-groves; after 12 min. a road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>diverges to the left to the Russian settlement, where we are shown
the site of the house of <i>Tabitha</i> and her rock-tomb (Acts ix. 35).
The Rue Boustrous leads to the left to the railway-station and the
pleasant houses of the <i>German Colony</i>, founded in 1868 (about
350 inhab., chiefly of the ‘Temple’ sect).</p>

<p class='c016'>A second colony of these Templars is <i>Sarona</i>, 1 M. to the N.E.,
behind the dunes, in the coast-plain of <i>Sharon</i> between Jaffa and Cæsarea,
famed ever since ancient times for its fertility. The vine in particular
thrives here admirably.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Jaffa the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> soon passes the mouth of the <i>Nahr
el-Aujâ</i>, the largest river in Palestine next to the Jordan, and then,
near the N. boundary of Judæa, the site of <i>Apollonia</i> (now <i>Arsûf</i>).
Farther on we sight the scanty ruins of <i>Caesarea Palaestina</i> (Arabic
<i>El-Kaisarîyeh</i>), a seaport founded by Herod the Great, which
in the Roman period surpassed Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the <i>Nahr ez-Zerkâ</i> (‘blue river’, p. xxxiii), the <i>Crocodile
River</i> of Pliny, come the little town of <i>Tantûra</i>, the <i>Dor</i> of the
Old Testament, which classical authors say was a Phœnician colony,
and then <i>Atlît</i>, the <i>Castellum Peregrinorum</i> of the Crusaders,
the seat of the Knights Templar in 1218–91, with its grand ruins.</p>

<p class='c011'>The beautiful outlines of *<i>Mt. Carmel</i> (1811 ft.; <i>Jebel Mâr
Elyâs</i>, ‘sacred mount of Elijah’) become more distinct. On the hill-side
is the <i>Carmelite Monastery</i> (558 ft.), the original seat of the
order, which extended its sphere to Europe in 1238. Below it, on
the evergreen N. slope of the range, rises a <i>Lighthouse</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most of the steamers call at the open roads of <b>Haifa</b> or <i>Khaifa</i>
(Hôt. Karmel or Krafft, pens. 8–10 fr.; carr. at the tourist-office of
Unger &#38; Hermann, at G. Sus’s, etc.; Brit. vice-cons., P. Abela;
U. S. cons. agent, Th. Struve; pop. 16,000), a rapidly rising commercial
town, beautifully situated at the N. base of Mt. Carmel and
on the S. shore of the <i>Bay of Acre</i>, not far from the site of the
<i>Sycaminum</i> of antiquity. The trade is chiefly in the hands of the
German ‘Temple’ sect, whose settlement presents a striking contrast
to the prevailing Oriental squalor.</p>

<p class='c016'>A <span class='sc'>Road</span> leads from Haifa viâ <i>Atlît</i> and <i>Tantûra</i> (see above), and then
inland viâ the Jewish agricultural colony of <i>Zammarín</i> (Hôt. Graff) and
<i>Kakûn</i> (410 ft.) to <b>Nàbulus</b> or <i>Nâblus</i> (1870 ft.; Hôt. Nablus, German,)
once <i>Sichem</i>, the capital of <i>Samaria</i>. After the war of 67 A.D. (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>)
it was re-founded by Vespasian as <i>Flavia Neapolis</i>. It is now a town of
27,000 inhab. (incl. 700 Christians and 170 members of the Samaritan sect).
Fine view from <i>Mt. Gerizim</i> (2848 ft.; Arab. <i>Jebel et-Tôr</i>), to the S. of the
town. A new road leads from Nâbulus, past <i>Jacob’s Well</i> (St. John, iv. 5–30),
viâ <i>El-Lubban</i> and <i>El-Bireh</i>, to <i>Jerusalem</i> (p. <a href='#Page_470'>470</a>).</p>

£ 1 Turkish = 96 pias.). Most travellers, however, prefer the following
profoundly interesting route, joining the train at <i>Samakh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_469'>469</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>We drive from Haifa to (24 M.) <i>Nazareth</i> (1145 ft.; Hôt. Germania,
pens. 8–12½ fr.), the home of Christ, whence the Christians in the Levant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>are still called Nazarenes (Nasâra). Then past <i>Mt. Tabor</i> (1844 ft.; <i>Jebel
et-Tor</i>; fine view), the traditional scene of the Transfiguration, and <i>Kafr
Kennâ</i>, the <i>Cana</i> of the Bible (St. John, ii), to (4½ hrs.) <b>Tabarîya</b> (82 ft.
below sea-level; Hôt. Tiberias or Grossmann, pens. 10–12½ fr.; pop. 7500,
incl. many Polish Jews), the ancient <i>Tiberias</i>, once the capital of <i>Galilee</i>,
and, after the destruction of Jerusalem (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>), the chief seat of the Jewish
nation. It lies high up on the W. bank of the <i>Lake of Gennesaret</i>, or <i>of
Tiberias</i>, or <i>Sea of Galilee</i> (682 ft. below sea-level; 13 M. long, 7½ M.
broad), through which flows the <i>Jordan</i>. During half of the year the
climate in this profound Syrian valley is extremely hot.</p>

<p class='c022'>From Tiberias we row down the lake in 2 hrs. to the rail. station of
<i>Samakh</i> (610 ft. below sea-level; 54½ M. from Haifa). The train ascends
the *<i>Yarmuk Valley</i> to (100 M.) <i>Derât</i> (1735 ft. above sea-level; Buffet),
where it joins the main Hejâz line to <i>Damascus</i> (p. <a href='#Page_484'>484</a>; Kadem station).—For
details, see <i>Baedeker’s Palestine and Syria</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Haifa all the steamers skirt the coast of ancient <i>Phoenicia</i>
at some distance from land, as the cliffs here endanger navigation,
but the numerous small headlands, bays, and islands adapt
it admirably for settlement. It once extended, far beyond Beirut,
to the river <i>Eleutheros</i>, now <i>Nahr el-Kebîr</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From afar we sight the lighthouse and forts of <i>Akka</i> or <i>Acre</i>,
the ancient <i>Akko</i> (later <i>Ptolemais</i>). In 1104 it became the naval
station of the Crusaders. Taken by Saladin in 1187 it was recaptured
by Richard Cœur-de-Lion in 1191 and for a century was a
great bulwark of Christianity. Under the name of <i>St. Jean d’Acre</i>
it was the seat of the knights of St. John (p. <a href='#Page_475'>475</a>) after their expulsion
from Jerusalem. Far to the N.E. rises <i>Mt. Hermon</i> (p. <a href='#Page_489'>489</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the white <i>Râs el-Nâkûra</i>, the ancient <i>Scala Tyriorum</i>,
and <i>Râs el-Abyad</i>, the <i>Promontorium Album</i> of Pliny, we
sight a low headland on which lies the poor little town of <b>Sûr</b>,
with a ruined church of the Crusaders, ruins of their fortifications,
and a lighthouse. This was the ancient seaport of <i>Tyre</i>, once situated
on two islands, but connected with the mainland by an embankment
built by Alexander during his famous siege (332 B.C.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on we pass the mouth of the <i>Nahr el-Lîtânî</i> (p. <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>),
here called <i>Nahr el-Kâsimîyeh</i>, and obtain a fine view of the coast-region
in front of <i>Lebanon</i>; to the E. rise <i>Jebel er-Rihân</i> and
<i>Tômât Nîhâ</i> (6070 ft.; ‘twins of Nîhâ’), snow-capped in winter,
and to the N.E. the distant <i>Jebel Sannîn</i> (p. <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Sarafant</i> (ancient <i>Zarpath</i> or <i>Sarepta</i>) opens the
broad bay of <b>Saida</b>, formerly <i>Sidon</i>, the oldest and, next to Tyre,
greatest port of the Phœnicians, now girdled by rich vegetation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the mouth of the <i>Nahr el-Auwâlî</i> (ancient <i>Bostrenus</i>)
and the <i>Râs er-Rumeileh</i>, the N. limit of the bay of Saida, we come
to the far-projecting <i>Râs ed-Dâmûr</i> and the <i>Nahr ed-Dâmûr</i>,
the ancient <i>Tamyras</i>, which in winter is one of the most copious
rivers in the Lebanon region. Near Beirut begin the mulberry and
olive groves and the vineyards of the fertile coast-plain.</p>

<p class='c011'>We round the reddish hills of <i>Râs Beirût</i> (p. <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>), with the
pigeons’ grottoes and lighthouse, and enter <i>Beirut</i> harbour (p. <a href='#Page_481'>481</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Jaffa</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_467'>467</a>. The train skirts the orchards around Jaffa
(with Sarona on the left) and turns to the S.E. through the plain of
Sharon (p. <a href='#Page_468'>468</a>), following the depression of the <i>Wâdi Miserâra</i>.
On the right is the agricultural colony of the Alliance Israélite.

<p class='c011'>12 M. <i>Lydda</i>, Arabic <i>Ludd</i>, Old Test. <i>Lod</i>, Gr.-Rom. <i>Diospolis</i>,
was severed from Samaria by the Maccabees (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>) in 145
B.C. and annexed to Judæa.</p>

<p class='c011'>14 M. <b>Er-Ramleh</b> (accommodation at the Franciscan convent;
pop. exceeding 7000, incl. 2500 Christians), founded by the Omaiyades
(p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>) in 716, was the <i>Ramula</i> of the era of the Crusades,
when it was even more important than Jerusalem. The chief sight
is the *<i>Minaret</i> of the oldest mosque (<i>Jâmi el-Abyad</i>, ‘white
mosque’), famed also for its view. It was erected by En-Nâsir
(p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>) in 1318, in a style recalling the Romanesque transition
buildings of the Crusaders (p. <a href='#Page_474'>474</a>), but has lost its original summit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train crosses the Jerusalem road and runs to the S. through
marshy flats to (18 M.) the village of <i>Nâaneh</i>. At some distance
from the railway <i>Akir</i>, once <i>Ekron</i>, one of the five chief cities of
the Philistines (p. <a href='#Page_466'>466</a>), lies on the right (W.), and on the left (E.)
are the famous ruins of <i>Tell Jezer</i>, mentioned in the letters found
at Tell el-Amarna (p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>), originally the Canaanitish (Phœnician)
city of <i>Gezer</i> (a drive of 1 hr. from Er-Ramleh).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span><i>Jerusalem</i> (Hebrew <i>Yerushalayim</i>, Gr. and Lat. <i>Hierosolyma</i>,
Arabic <i>El-Kuds</i>) lies in 31°46′ N. lat. and 35°13′ E. long., on an
arid limestone plateau (cold in winter) which rises in the form
of a peninsula from the <i>Kidron Valley</i> (<i>Wâdi Sitti Maryam</i>,
‘Mary’s Valley’), on the E., and from the <i>Valley of Hinnom</i> (<i>Wâdi
er-Rabâbi</i>), on the S. side. The narrow E. height (2441 ft.), the
ancient <i>Temple Hill</i>, is separated from the W. hill, that of the old
<i>Upper Town</i> (2550 ft.), by a depression, now very slight, called
<i>Tyropoeon</i> (‘dung valley’) by Josephus, the Jewish historian. Still
higher is the N.W. angle of the present town (2591 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The population is estimated at 70,000, of whom 45,000 are Jews,
living mostly on alms bestowed by the charitable institutions of their
European co-religionists; of the 15,000 Christians nearly half are
Syrians of the Greek orthodox faith; the Moslems number about
10,000. In spring, especially at the time of the Greek Easter, the
town is flooded with pilgrims, the majority being Russians. As a
centre of the three chief religions of the world, Jerusalem has quite
a religious atmosphere and is historically a city of overwhelming
interest, but its tranquillity is sadly marred by the dissensions
and jealousies of its numerous religious communities. Careful and
patient study alone will reveal to the traveller something of the
departed glory of the venerable capital of the Jewish empire.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> From the tablets of Tell el-Amarna (p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>) it appears that
<i>Urusalim</i> was the capital of a small principality dependent on Egypt
about 1400 B.C. When the Israelites under David conquered the town
in the 11th cent. (2 Sam. v. 6–10) it was the chief stronghold of the Jebusites,
a Canaanitish tribe. David made it his residence and built a
castle known as the City of David. His son Solomon, with the aid of
Phœnician artificers, afterwards built his palace and the Temple of Jehovah
on Mt. Zion (the E. hill). On the bi-partition of the kingdom after
his death Jerusalem became the capital of Judah. The kingdom of Israel
in N. Palestine was subjugated by the Assyrians in 722 B.C., and in 597
Jerusalem, under Jehoiachin, shared a like fate at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar
of Babylon. In 586 the revolt under Zedekiah led to the destruction
of the city. On the return of the Jews from captivity in 538 the city
and Temple were gradually rebuilt, and the new town-wall was completed
in 444. On the death of Alexander the Great in 323 Jerusalem fell into the
hands of the Ptolemies (p. <a href='#Page_433'>433</a>) and often suffered severely from conflicts with
the Diadochi of Syria. The last royal dynasty, that of the Maccabees
(167–63), was overthrown by the Romans when Pompey conquered the city.
As the residence of Herod the Great (37–4 B.C., according to the accepted
chronology), in the last year of whose reign Christ was born, Jerusalem
prospered anew. A new palace in the Roman style was erected at the
N.W. angle of the upper town, and the rebuilding of the Temple was
begun. But a revolt of the Zealots, or Jewish national party, led to
embittered struggles with the Romans in 67 A.D., with the result that
Jerusalem was stormed by Titus in 70, the Temple burned down, and
the city was completely destroyed as Carthage had once been. Another
rising of the Jews under Trajan (117) extended as far as the Cyrenaica
(comp. p. <a href='#Page_413'>413</a>) in N. Africa. On the ruins of the city, on a site almost
coinciding with that enclosed by the present city-walls, Emp. Hadrian
erected the new pagan colony of <i>Ælia Capitolina</i>, from which, after the
last revolt, that of Bar Cochba (132–5), Jews were excluded.</p>

<p class='c022'>The modern history of Christian Jerusalem begins with the building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre by Emp. Constantine (about 326–36).
Pilgrims soon flocked to the holy places, and in 570 there were already
hospices with 3000 beds for their use. In 614 the Persians under Chosroes
II. (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>) sacked the city, but when it was captured by caliph Omar
in 637 it was treated with clemency, being regarded as a sacred place by
Moslems as well as by Christians. In 691 began the erection of the famous
Dome of the Rock, on the sacred rock (p. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>), the site of the ancient
Jewish Temple, the greatest sanctuary of Islam after the Kaaba of Mecca.
Jerusalem fell into the hands of the Egyptian Fatimites in 969, but was
wrested from them by the Seljuks in 1077. It was chiefly the maltreatment
of the Christian pilgrims by the Seljuks that gave rise to the First
Crusade. In 1099 the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem, which under Godfrey
de Bouillon (d. 1100) became the capital of the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem.
The city was retaken by Saladin in 1187, but in 1229 was voluntarily
ceded by Melik el-Kâmil to Emp. Frederick II. Lastly, in 1244, it was
stormed by the Kharezmians, and has been under Moslem rule ever since.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Books.</span> Among the best of the numerous works on Jerusalem are
<i>Barclay’s</i> ‘City of the Great King’, <i>Besant &#38; Palmer’s</i> ‘Jerusalem, the
City of Herod and Saladin’ (5th ed., London, 1908), <i>Warren’s</i> ‘Underground
Jerusalem’ (London, 1876), and <i>Wilson &#38; Warren’s</i> ‘Recovery of
Jerusalem’ (London, 1871). <i>Miss A. Goodrich-Freer’s</i> ‘Inner Jerusalem’
(1904), <i>Laurence Hutton’s</i> ‘Literary Landmarks of Jerusalem’, and <i>C. R.
Conder’s</i> ‘The City of Jerusalem’ (London, 1909) also may be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<span class='sc'>Old Town</span> is enclosed by a *<i>Wall</i> of the 13–14th cent.,
restored by Suleiman the Great (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) in 1537–41; it is 40 ft.
high and about 2½ M. long. The two main streets lead to the W.
from the <i>Jaffa Gate</i> (Pl. D, 5, 6; Arabic Bâb el-Khalîl), and N.
from the handsome <i>Damascus Gate</i> (Pl. D, 5, 6; Bâb el-Amûd)
respectively. They divide the town into four quarters, to the N.W.
the Greek-Frank, S.W. the Armenian, S.E. the Jewish, and N.E. the
Moslem. The streets are crooked, often vaulted over, and, in the
Jewish quarter especially, very dirty. All the houses have rain-water
cisterns, besides which there are several reservoirs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Jaffa Suburb</span>, situated to the N.W., is the most important,
in style the most European. It is the chief seat of the European or
‘Frank’ inhabitants and contains the consulates, several churches,
and the extensive <i>Russian Buildings</i> (Pl. A-C, 2, 3).—Outside the
<i>Gate of Zion</i> (Pl. E, 7, 8; Bâb en-Nebi Dâûd, ‘gate of the prophet
David’), but originally within the town-walls, lies the so-called
<i>Zion Suburb</i>. It contains the Christian cemeteries, the German
Benedictine monastery <i>Dormitio Sanctae Mariae</i> (Pl. E, 8; ‘death-sleep
of Mary’), with the new <i>Church of St. Mary</i>, and the now Mohammedan
buildings of <i>En-Nebi Dâûd</i> (Pl. E, 8; with ‘David’s
Tomb’ and the ‘Room of the Last Supper’). Near the railway-station
(p. <a href='#Page_470'>470</a>) is the substantial German <i>Temple Colony</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_468'>468</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We begin our visit to the old town at the Jaffa Gate, a busy centre
of traffic, to which the road from the station leads (p. <a href='#Page_480'>480</a>). To
the S.E. of the gate, and partly on the site of Herod’s palace, rises
the citadel <i>El-Kala</i> (Pl. D, 6; 14th and 16th cent.); the N.E. tower
probably corresponds to the Phasaël Tower of the time of Herod.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>David Street</span>, one of the chief business streets, under different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>names (Sueikat Allân, Hâret el-Bizâr, and Tarîk Bâb es-Silseleh;
Pl. D-G, 5), connects the Jaffa Gate with the Silseleh Gate of the
Haram esh-Sherîf (p. <a href='#Page_476'>476</a>). On the left, opposite the citadel, is the
well-stocked <i>New Bazaar</i> (Pl. D, 5).</p>

<p class='c011'>At <i>St. John’s Monastery</i> (Pl. 29; E, 5), the Greek pilgrims’
hospice at the S.W. angle of the Mûristân (p. <a href='#Page_475'>475</a>), we first turn
to the left into the <span class='sc'>Hâret en-Nâsara</span> (Pl. E, 5, 4; Christians’ Street).
On the left is the very ancient <i>Patriarch’s Pool</i> (Birket Hammâm
el-Batrak; Pl. E, 5), assigned by tradition to king Hezekiah (about
700 B.C.); on the right is the <i>Patriarch’s Bath</i>. Opposite the
<i>Great Greek Monastery</i> (Deir er-Rûm el-Kebîr; Pl. D, E, 4, 5),
is, on the right, the entrance to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Church of the Holy Sepulchre</b> (Pl. E, 4; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_471'>471</a>),
whose principal dome, crowned with a gilded cross, is everywhere
conspicuous. This, especially at Easter, is the great goal of the
pilgrims. The discovery of the Holy Sepulchre, which Eusebius,
Bishop of Cæsarea, the father of church history (314–40), tells us
was made by Constantine, induced that emperor to build a round
church here, the so-called Anastasis (church of the resurrection),
and a five-aisled basilica, dedicated to the sign of the Cross (Martyrion).
These churches having been burned down by the Persians
(p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>), Abbot Modestus, under Emp. Heraclius, began to build,
in 629, a new church of the resurrection, the prototype of the Dome
of the Rock (p. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>), a new church of the Cross, and a small Calvary
church on the supposed site of the Crucifixion (Golgotha). A fourth
church, that of St. Mary, is said to have existed here in 670. Between
1140 and 1149, the period of the Second Crusade, the Crusaders
caused a great new church to be built by the architect <i>Jourdain</i>,
in the Romanesque transition style, under Arabian influence, an
edifice intended to embrace almost all the holy places. On the E.
side of the new double church a chapel was dedicated to St. Helena
(d. about 326), the mother of Constantine, who, according to later
historians, once made a pilgrimage to the holy places and discovered
the true Cross near the Sepulchre. On the S. side of the double
church a Gothic clock-tower, originally detached, was erected in
1160–80. After the destructions of 1187 and 1244 (see p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>),
we hear of a handsome new church existing here in 1310. At length
in 1719 a great part of the church was rebuilt, and at the joint
cost of the Greeks and the Armenians, again in 1810 by the architect
<i>Komnenos Kalfa</i>. Since then the Greek cathedral, the dome-roofed
‘Catholicon’, has occupied the nave of what was once the
Crusaders’ basilica. Among the many additions the chapel of the
Apparition (p. <a href='#Page_475'>475</a>) is one of the oldest (14th cent.).</p>

<p class='c016'>In the N.W. corner of the <span class='sc'>Quadrangle</span>, or outer court, over the
Chapel of the Forty Martyrs, rises the Bell Tower, the upper part of which
has been destroyed. The Façade, dating from the era of the Crusades,
has fine reliefs of the French school over the portals.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>A vestibule, where the custodians (p. <a href='#Page_471'>471</a>) sit, leads to the Stone of
Unction (John xix. 38–40), last renewed in 1808.</p>

<p class='c022'>The great <span class='sc'>Rotunda</span> of the Sepulchre still has the foundation pillars,
the massive outer wall of the W. semicircle, and the three apses of the
Crusaders’ church. The round central structure embraces the Chapel of
the Sepulchre and the Angels’ Chapel. Adjoining the Sepulchre is the
14th station of the Via Dolorosa (see below).</p>

<p class='c022'>From the N.E. side of the ambulatory an ante-room leads to the
<span class='sc'>Chapel of the Apparition</span>, the chief Latin (Rom. Cath.) sanctuary, on
the spot where Christ is said to have appeared to his mother. In a niche
is shown a fragment of the ‘Column of Scourging’.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>Nave</span>, which we next visit, has suffered greatly from the introduction
of the Catholicon. The pointed windows, the clustered pillars,
and the groined vaulting still bear traces of their origin in the Crusaders’
era. The southmost of the three chapels in the apse, in the outer wall
of the choir ambulatory, contains the ‘Column of the Derision’.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the left of this chapel a flight of 29 steps descends to <span class='sc'>St. Helena’s
Chapel</span>, belonging to the Armenians, on the site of Constantine’s
basilica, with foundations of the period of Modestus; 13 more steps descend
thence to the Chapel of the Finding of the Cross.</p>

<p class='c022'>We now return to the ambulatory and ascend from it, to the left
(S.), to the higher-lying <span class='sc'>Golgotha Chapels</span>, the 10–13th stations on the
Via Dolorosa (see below).</p>

<p class='c009'>On the S. side of the quadrangle, in front of the Holy Sepulchre
Church, lies the <b>Mûristân</b> (Pl. E, F, 5), an open space of 170 by
150 yds., which contained, from the days of Charlemagne onwards,
the hostels and hospitals of the European pilgrims and, from 1140,
the grand buildings of the Knights of St. John. Saladin (p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>)
granted it as a charitable endowment (wakf) to the Dome of the
Rock (p. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>), but allowed the old hostels to remain. The larger W.
half, with modern shops, now belongs to the Greek patriarchate; the
E. half was presented by the sultan to Prussia. At the N.E. corner,
next to the street called Hâret ed-Dabbârîn, is the German Prot.
<i>Church of the Redeemer</i> (Pl. E, 5).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Mûristân is bounded on the E. by the now unimportant
<i>Old Bazaar</i>, or sûk, the three parallel streets of which form part of
the great thoroughfare between the Damascus and Zion gates (p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>).
The middle street, the Sûk el-Attârin (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>), is continued to the
N. by the Khân ez-Zeit (Pl. F, 4), from which an alley on the left
leads to the <i>Abyssinian</i> and <i>Coptic Monasteries</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the Coptic Monastery is the 9th station on the <b>Via Dolorosa</b>,
the ‘route of suffering’, mentioned for the first time in the
16th cent., on which Christ is said to have borne the Cross from
Pilate’s house to Golgotha. The last five stations are within the
Holy Sepulchre Church (see above). The other stations lie between
the Greek <i>Monastery of St. Caralombos</i> (Pl. 24, E F, 4; 8th station)
and the <i>Barracks</i> (Pl. G, 3; 1st station) in the Tarîk Bâb Sitti
Maryam (street of the Virgin Mary’s gate).</p>

<p class='c011'>This street leads to the E. to <i>St. Stephen’s Gate</i> (Pl. H, I, 3;
2405 ft.), the only E. gate of the city, called by the natives <i>Bâb
Sitti Maryam</i>, or Lady Mary’s Gate, from its proximity to the
Virgin’s Tomb (see p. <a href='#Page_480'>480</a>).</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>Within the gate a passage leads to the N. to the fine old <b>Church of
St. Anne</b> (Pl. H, 3; Arabic <i>Es-Salâhiyeh</i>), on the supposed site of the
house of Joachim and Anna, the parents of the Virgin. It is mentioned as
already existing in the 7th cent., but in its present form dates chiefly from
the 12th. The crypt hewn in the rock is the traditional birthplace of the
Virgin, and the tombs of Joachim and Anna also are now pointed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now retrace our steps towards the W., and halfway along
the Via Dolorosa follow the El-Wâd street (Pl. F, G, 4, 5) to the
left, through the hollow of the ancient Tyropœon (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>), to the
Sûk el-Kattânîn (see below), near the entrance to the Haram esh-Sherîf;
or starting from the Old Bazaar, we reach the same point
by the <span class='sc'>Tarîk Bâb es-Silseleh</span> (Pl. F, G, 5).</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Haram esh-Sherîf</b> (Pl. G-I, 4–6; ‘noble sanctuary’),
the ancient site of the Temple, is the most interesting place in
Jerusalem. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_471'>471</a>. The usual entrance is by the <i>Bâb
el-Kattânîn</i> (Pl. G, 4, 5), the central W. gate, built by En-Nâsir
(p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>) in 1318, behind the now deserted Sûk el-Kattânîn (cotton-market).</p>

<p class='c011'>On this site king David erected an altar (2 Sam. xxiv. 25), and
Solomon built his palace and Temple. Here stood also the second
Temple, erected about 520–516 after the Babylonish captivity, and
the third Temple, begun by Herod the Great (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>) in 20 B.C.
but never completed on the grand scale projected. On the same
spot Hadrian erected a temple of Jupiter as the chief sanctuary
of Ælia Capitolina (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>), and near the S. wall of the great
quadrangle Justinian built a basilica in honour of the Virgin,
which afterwards became the mosque of El-Aksâ. Beyond these
facts little or nothing is known of the history of this memorable
site during the early centuries of the Christian era.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mohammed, who claimed to have visited this spot, evinced great
reverence for the ancient Temple, and before he had broken off his
relations with the Jews he even enjoined believers to turn towards
Jerusalem in prayer. About the year 637 caliph Omar converted
the church of St. Mary into a mosque, and the Omaiyade Abd el-Melik
(685–705) erected the famous Dome of the Rock on a platform
in the centre of the sacred precincts, a building which the Crusaders
took to be Solomon’s Temple. Adjoining the mosque of El-Aksâ,
then called the Porticus or Palatium Salomonis, probably stood the
royal palace of the Franks and the castle of the Knights Templar.</p>

<p class='c011'>The huge substructions of the Temple plateau, the surface of
which was much altered by Saladin, still date from the reign of
Herod. The plateau itself forms an immense quadrangle of irregular
shape (W. side 536, E. side 518, N. side 351, S. side 310 yds. long).
In the N.W. corner, once perhaps the site of Baris, the castle of
the Maccabees, and of the Roman castle of Antonia, rises the highest
<i>Minaret</i> of the Haram. The buildings by the W. and N. walls, Koran
schools, dwellings, etc., with open arcades on the groundfloor, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>unimportant. The great quadrangle, now partly planted with trees,
is studded with numerous <i>mastabas</i>, raised platforms with prayer-niches
(mihrâbs), and <i>sebîls</i>, or fountains for the religious ablutions.
Especially to the S.W. of the Dome the ground is honeycombed
with deep <i>Cisterns</i>, some of which are very ancient.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the precincts and passing the pretty <i>Sebîl</i> of Kâït
Bey (p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>) we mount one of the flights of steps of the time of
Abd el-Melik to the <span class='sc'>Platform</span>, 10 ft. in height.</p>

<p class='c011'>The so-called **<b>Dome of the Rock</b> (<i>Kubbet es-Sakhra</i>;
Pl. H, 4, 5), usually but erroneously called Omar’s Mosque, was
built, according to the Arabian historians, by Abd el-Melik for
political reasons, the Omaiyades being at that period denied access
to the Kaaba at Mecca. The year 72 of the Hegira (691–2) is mentioned
as the date of its erection. The chief restorations in the middle
ages were undertaken by the Fatimite Ez-Zâhir (1021–36), who rebuilt
the dome in 1022, and by Saladin, to whom is due the
superb stucco decoration of the dome. Most of the later additions
were made by the Turkish sultan Suleiman the Great (1520–66).
The W. porch alone is quite modern.</p>

<p class='c016'>The building, in the late-Roman and Byzantine style (comp. p. <a href='#Page_548'>548</a>), is
in the form of an octagon, 50 yds. in diameter, with sides 22½ yds. in length,
and with two concentric aisles. Above the inner aisle rises the boldly
designed *Dome (98 ft. high), consisting of two wooden vaults placed one
inside the other and roofed with plates of copper. The external walls
are still incrusted below with their old slabs of marble, while above
the window-sills the ancient glass mosaics were replaced in the time of
Suleiman by superb Persian porcelain-tiles (kishâni). The keel-arches of
the windows are of the same period.</p>

<p class='c022'>The two aisles are separated by two series of supports. Between the
eight pillars of the outer octagonal aisle, which are incrusted with marble
dating from the time of Suleiman, rise sixteen columns with late-Roman
or early-Byzantine capitals, and the round-arched arcades are connected,
above the Byzantine imposts, by tie-beams overlaid with copper. The
inner row of supports, bearing the dome, consists of four large pillars
and twelve antique monolith columns. The pointed arches of the
vaulting here, dating from Suleiman’s restoration, rest immediately on
the capitals. The wrought-iron screen is of French workmanship of the
Crusaders’ era.</p>

<p class='c022'>The glass *Mosaics in the spandrels of the outer aisle, executed by
Byzantine artificers, all belong to the earliest building; those in the
drum of the dome are partly of the time of Ez-Zâhir and of Saladin.
The stucco decoration of the dome was restored under Mohammed en-Nâsir
(p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>) in 1318, and again in 1830. The *Windows, dating from Suleiman’s
restoration, present a marvellous wealth of colouring.</p>

<p class='c022'>Enclosed by the inner aisle, and best viewed from the high bench
beside the N.W. gate of the screen, is the <i>Sacred Rock</i>, measuring
18½ by 14½ yds., and rising 4–6½ ft. above the pavement of the church.
Under it is a cavity, probably once a cistern. The rock is supposed to
have been the site of the great Jewish altar of burnt-offering. The Jews
and the Moslems believe it to have been also the scene of Abraham’s
sacrifice. From this spot Mohammed is said to have been translated to
heaven on his miraculous steed Burâk, while an angel restrained the rock
in its attempt to follow him; here too, they believe, will be erected the
throne of God on the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>Outside the E. gate of the Dome of the Rock, and probably as
old, is the so-called <span class='sc'>Dome of the Chain</span> (<i>Kubbet es-Silseleh</i>, or
<i>Mehkemet Dâûd</i>, ‘David’s Place of Judgment’). This structure
consists of two concentric rows of columns, the outer forming a
hexagon, the inner an endecagon. The large prayer-recess on the
S. side, facing Mecca, is of the 13th century. The arcades, connected
by tie-beams, and the drum of the dome are richly adorned with
fayence tiles of Suleiman’s period. Across the dome, it is said, will
be stretched a chain (silseleh) on the Day of Judgment, from which
the awful scales will be suspended.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now descend from the platform by the steps near the ‘<i>Summer
Pulpit</i>’ (15th cent.), at the S.E. angle, and walk past the round
basin of <i>El-Kâs</i> to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Mesjid el-Aksâ</b> (Pl. H, 5, 6), the sanctuary ‘farthest’ from
Mecca and one of the holy places of Proto-Islam, to which God is
said to have brought Mohammed from Mecca in one night (Sureh
xvii. 1). The mosque without its additions is now 88 yds. long
and 60 yds. wide. Of the church of Justinian nothing apparently
has survived except the columns of the nave and two inner aisles.
The capitals perhaps date from caliph Omar’s period (637). The
broad transept was probably constructed by the Abbaside El-Mehdi
(775–95); the wooden dome is now covered with lead outside. The
transept gave the edifice the form of a <b>⟙</b>, which was converted later
into a rectangle by the two rows of aisles added on the E. and W.
These, in their present shape, and the pointed arcades of the nave
and inner aisles, connected by tie-beams, belong to a late period of
restoration. The so-called White Mosque, now set apart for women,
a long double corridor to the W. of the transept, probably once
belonged to the castle of the Knights Templar. The latest addition
is the porch built by Melik el-Muazzam Isâ (d. 1227) and restored
at a later period. Its middle arcades imitate Frank Gothic.</p>

<p class='c016'>The interior was once almost as sumptuously decorated as the Dome
of the Rock. The *Pulpit (mimbar), carved in wood and inlaid with ivory
and mother-of-pearl, executed by order of Nûreddîn (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>) in 1169 for
the great mosque of Aleppo, was presented by Saladin. To him also the
mosque owes the prayer-recess, with its graceful little marble columns, the
superb mosaics of the mihrâb-wall, and the drum of the dome. The author
or at least restorer of the decorations of the dome is said to have been
Mohammed en-Nâsir (p. <a href='#Page_448'>448</a>). The windows date only from the time of
Suleiman.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the S.E. corner of the Haram area a staircase descends to a
small <i>Moslem Oratory</i> with the ‘Cradle of Christ’ and to 13
vaulted galleries, part of the old substructure of the Haram, known
as <i>Solomon’s Stables</i>. In the sixth gallery, counting from the E.,
there is a small door in the S. wall called the ‘<i>Single Gate</i>‘, an
old entrance to the Haram.</p>

<p class='c011'>The roof of the ‘<i>Golden Gate</i>’ (Pl. H, I, 4; Bâb ed-Dâhirîyeh),
the only E. gate of the Haram, dating from the reign of Justinian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>(?) but now built up, affords a survey of the whole great
quadrangle. At our feet lies the Kidron valley (p. <a href='#Page_480'>480</a>), with its
rock-tombs, and opposite rises the Mt. of Olives (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>Time permitting, we may now visit the <i>Wailing Place of the
Jews</i> (Kautal Maarbei; Pl. G, 5), to the W. of the Haram, reached
by descending (to the S.) the eastmost side-street of the Tarîk Bâb
es-Silseleh. It is probable that the Jews, who never enter the
Haram precincts for fear of desecrating the holy of holies, were in
the habit of repairing hither as early as the middle ages to bewail
the downfall of Jerusalem. The scene is most touching on Friday
afternoons (after 4 p.m.), when crowds of mourners flock to the
place and litanies are chanted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Mount of Olives</b> (<i>Mons Oliveti</i>, <i>Jebel et-Tûr</i>), running
parallel to the Temple hill, is closely associated with the last days
of Christ on earth. It is visited (best in the forenoon) either by
carriage from the Jaffa or the Damascus Gate (10–12 fr.; ascent
½ hr.), or on horseback (p. <a href='#Page_471'>471</a>) or on foot from St. Stephen’s Gate
(p. <a href='#Page_475'>475</a>). Those who return by the valley of the Kidron should
order their carriage to meet them at the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Damascus Gate (p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>) the road leads past the <i>Dominican
Monastery of St. Stephen</i> (on the right; Pl. E, 1) and
then, beyond the Anglican <i>Bishop’s House</i>, past the so-called
<i>Tombs of the Kings</i> (on the right). This large subterranean burial-ground,
with its tomb-chambers and shaft-tombs, probably belonged
to queen Helena of Adiabene and her family (1st cent. A.D.). The
road to Nâbulus soon diverges to the left; ours ascends in a wide
curve northwards to the top of the <i>Scopus</i> and to the Mt. of Olives.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. height of the Mt. of Olives, to the left of the road,
is the new German <i>Augusta Victoria Institute</i> (sanatorium and
church).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the E. summit (2665 ft.) are the Russian Buildings, a pilgrims’
hospice, the <i>Russian Church of the Ascension</i>, and a six-storied
<i>Belvedere Tower</i> (214 steps). The *Panorama embraces
the city and the hills around Jerusalem and Bethlehem (the latter
itself not visible). Towards the E. lie the Dead Sea (1293 ft. below
sea-level) and the Jordan valley (Arabic El-Ghôr), and among the
bluish Mts. of Moab rises Mt. Nebo (2644 ft.), whence Moses beheld
the promised land before his death (Deut. xxxiv. 1–4).</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the W. of the Russian Buildings lies the poor village
<b>Kafr et-Tûr</b>. Near it is the <i>Chapel of the Ascension</i>, built in
1834–5, to mark the scene of the Ascension (in contradiction to
Luke xxiv. 50, ‘He led them out as far as Bethany’). Of the
earlier churches here, one a round building of Emp. Constantine,
the other built by the Crusaders, few traces are left.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the village are the <span class='sc'>Latin Buildings</span>, including the
<i>Credo</i> and <i>Paternoster Churches</i> (1898).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>A steep path descends hence, to the W., to the <span class='sc'>Garden of
Gethsemane</span> (Pl. K, 4), now the property of the Franciscans. Near
the entrance (E. side) a rock marks the spot where Peter, James,
and John are said to have slept (Mark xiv. 32 <i>et seq.</i>), and the
fragment of a column close by indicates the traditional scene of the
Betrayal. (A monk acts as guide; fee 3–6 pias.) A little higher up
the Greeks have their own Garden of Gethsemane, containing the
many-domed <i>Church of Mary Magdalen</i> (Pl. K, 4).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the N.W., on the road to the upper bridge over
the Kidron (Pl. I, 3) and to St. Stephen’s Gate, rises <i>St. Mary’s
Church</i> (Pl. K, 3; Arabic Kenîset Sitti Maryam), built by queen
Milicent or Melisendis (d. 1161) on the site of an ancient church
mentioned as early as the 5th cent.; it contains the ‘coffin of the
Virgin’, in which she lay until her Assumption.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <b>Valley of the Kidron</b>, identified from a very early age with
the <i>Valley of Jehoshaphat</i>, has been supposed, ever since pre-Christian
times, owing to a misinterpretation of Joel iii. 2, to be the future scene
of the Last Judgment. The Moslems bury their dead on the E. slope of
the Haram esh-Sherîf, and the Jews on the W. slope of the Mt. of Olives.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the Jericho road, to the S. of the Garden of Gethsemane, a path
diverges to the right to the lower bridge over the Kidron (Pl. I, 5). To
the left of the path are the so-called <i>Tomb of Absalom</i>, a cube of rock,
with a curious conical roof expanding at the top; <i>St. James’s Cavern</i>, a
rock-tomb; and the <i>Pyramid of Zacharias</i>. All these date from the
Græco-Roman period.</p>

<p class='c022'>Farther on, to the S.E., passing below the hill-village of <i>Siloah</i> (Pl.
H, I, 7–9; Arabic Kafr Silwân), we come to <i>St. Mary’s Fountain</i> (Pl. H,
7; Aïn Sitti Maryam), an intermittent spring, probably the <i>Gihon</i> of the
Old Testament. Since the time of Hezekiah (about 700 B.C.) its water
has flowed through the underground <i>Siloah Conduit</i> to the <i>Pool of Siloam</i>
(Pl. G, H, 9), within the Jewish town-wall.</p>

<p class='c022'>Farther down the valley we reach in a few minutes ‘<i>Job’s Well</i>’
(about 2035 ft.; Bîr Eiyûb).</p>

<p class='c022'>We return thence to the town by the <b>Valley of Hinnom</b> (p. <a href='#Page_472'>472</a>).
The ‘<i>Zion Suburb</i>’ (p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>) rises steeply on the N.W.; to the left is
the slope of <i>Jebel Abû Tôr</i>, covered with rock-tombs. Near (12 min.) the
<i>Sultan’s Pond</i> (see below) we join the Bethlehem road.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Excursion to Bethlehem</span>, by a good road (half-a-day; carr.
about 12 fr.; horse, see p. <a href='#Page_471'>471</a>), will even repay walkers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road descends to the S. from the Jaffa Gate (p. <a href='#Page_473'>473</a>) into the
<i>Valley of Hinnom</i> (see above). Beyond the <i>Birket es-Sultân</i> (Pl.
C, D, 8), an old Jewish reservoir restored by Suleiman the Great
(16th cent.), the station-road diverges to the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our road leads to the S.W. across the tableland of <i>El-Bukeia</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_470'>470</a>), past the traditional <i>Well of the Magi</i> (Matth. ii. 9), to the
(3 M.) Greek convent of <i>Mâr Elyâs</i> (left). Bethlehem appears in
the foreground. Fine view of the Dead Sea (p. <a href='#Page_479'>479</a>) to the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>At (4 M.) ‘<i>Rachel’s Tomb</i>’ (Kubbet Râhîl), built like the welis
or tombs of Moslem saints, the Hebron road diverges to the right.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>5 M. <b>Bethlehem</b> (2550 ft.; pop. about 11,000, almost all
Christians), the home of David and the birthplace of our Saviour,
has a situation resembling that of Jerusalem. It consists of eight
different quarters, containing many monasteries, hospitals, and
schools. Fine view from the German Prot. <i>Weihnachtskirche</i>
(‘Christmas Church’, 1893), on the W. outskirts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the traditional birthplace of Christ rises *<span class='sc'>St. Mary’s
Church</span>, now occupied by the Greeks, Latins, and Armenians
jointly. The original columnar basilica of the time of Constantine,
with its double aisles, is still the nucleus of the present church. It
was thoroughly renovated by the Crusaders, and the superb wallmosaics
were restored by the Byzantine Emp. Manuel Comnenos
(1143–80). The Greeks, who were in sole possession from 1672 to
1852, unfortunately added the transept wall.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Interior.</span> The entrance is by the old central portal, approached from
an open space once occupied by an atrium. Three passages lead through
the transept, with semicircular apses at either end, to the semicircular
choir. Among the almost obliterated mosaics is a quaint representation
of the Entry into Jerusalem in the S. apse.</p>

<p class='c022'>Adjoining the choir are two flights of steps descending into the
Crypt, or Chapel of the Nativity, and to the ‘Chapel of the Manger’,
the ‘dwelling of St. Jerome’ (b. about 340 in Dalmatia, d. in 420 at
Bethlehem), and his tomb, which also are highly revered.</p>

<p class='c022'>The stairs on the N. side ascend to the Latin Church of St. Catharine,
through which we return to the principal church.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Beirut</i> (Fr. <i>Beyrout</i>, Arab. <i>Beirût</i>; pop. 190,000), the chief commercial
place in Syria (<i>Esh-Shâm</i>), and the capital of the Turkish
vilayet (province of a <i>vali</i> or governor) of that name, is beautifully
situated, in 33° 50′ N. lat. and 35° 30′ E. long., on the S. shore of
<i>St. George’s Bay</i>, between <i>Râs Beirût</i> (p. <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>) and <i>Mt. St. Dimitri</i>.
To the E. rises <i>Lebanon</i> (p. xxxiv), with <i>Jebel Keneiseh</i> and <i>Jebel
Sannîn</i> (p. <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>). The climate is mild and pleasant (mean temperature
of Jan. 56° Fahr., of Aug. 81°), and the rainfall is considerable
(34 in.). The sea-breezes render the summer bearable, but
they are apt to fail in August and September. Many of the citizens
then seek refuge in the summer quarters of Lebanon, to which Egyptians
and Cypriotes also resort.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Berytus</i> (‘fountain’) is mentioned in the tablets of Tell el-Amarna
(p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>) as the seat of the Egyptian vassal Ammunira. It lay in the
territory of the <i>Giblites</i>, a northern branch of the Phœnicians. In 140
B.C., during the wars of the Diadochi, the town was entirely destroyed.
The Romans rebuilt it and named it <i>Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Berytus</i>,
after the daughter of Emp. Augustus. In the 3rd cent. its school of
Roman law became renowned. From that time down to the present day
it has been noted also for its silk-industry, which was transplanted to
Greece and to Sicily. In 529 the prosperity of the town was destroyed
by an earthquake. Since its conquest by the Arabs in 635 it has been
in the possession of the Moslems, except during the brief Crusaders’
occupation. Like Saida (p. <a href='#Page_469'>469</a>) it was a favourite residence of the able
Druse prince <i>Fakhreddîn</i> (1595–1634), who in league with the Venetians
wrested Central Syria from the Turks. They, however, later recaptured
Beirut. During the 19th cent. Beirut gradually attained a new lease of prosperity.
Under the Egyptian rule its sea-borne commerce increased, while
Saida and Tripoli declined. In 1840 the town was bombarded by the British
fleet and recaptured for the Turks. After the massacre of Christians in
1860 (see p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>) many Christians from central Syria settled at Beirut.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Moslem inhabitants (about 65,000) are in a considerable
minority. Among the Christians there are 64,000 Greeks, 40,000
Maronites, and 2100 Protestants. The Jews number about 5500.
An unusually large percentage of the natives can read and write.
The chief language is Arabic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beirut offers few sights. The poor and closely built <i>Old
Town</i> contains the <i>Great Mosque</i> (Pl. F, 2), once a Crusader’s
church, the <i>Greek Churches</i>, and the <i>Maronite Cathedral</i> (Pl. F, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Sûks</i> or markets have lost much of their Oriental character.
Most of the genuine native products come from Lebanon (keffîyehs
or head-cloths, embroidery, woven stuffs, slippers, bridal chests,
etc.). The filigree-work has long been noted (sold by weight).</p>

<p class='c011'>The native population may be studied also in the large <i>Place
des Canons</i> or <i>Place de l’Union</i> (Pl. F, 2), on the S. side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span><i>Serâi</i> or government-buildings. The numerous Arabian cafés are
for men only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The broad streets of the <span class='sc'>New Town</span> skirt the picturesque hill-sides.
Palm, orange, and lemon trees abound in the beautiful gardens.
The <i>Damascus Road</i> (tramway; Pl. G, 4, 5) leads to the S. in
½ hr. to the <i>Bois de Pins</i> (Pl. G, F, 6), a pine-wood planted by
Fakhreddîn for protection against the sand of the dunes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The finest point of view is *<i>Mt. St. Dimitri</i> (Pl. H, 3–5; best
by evening light), ½ hr. to the S.E. of the old town. From the
Place des Canons we follow the Derb en-Nahr (Pl. G, 2) and the

<p class='c009'><i>Damascus</i> (2268 ft.), formerly called <i>Dimishk</i>, a name still
sometimes used, but commonly called by the natives <i>Esh-Shâm</i> (a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>term applied also to the whole of Syria; p. <a href='#Page_482'>482</a>), lies on the borders
of the <i>Syrian Desert</i> (p. xxxiii) in the <i>Rûta</i>, a beautiful oasis between
Anti-Lebanon and the ‘<i>Meadow Lakes</i>‘, into which fall all
the branches and canals of the Baradâ. As the Koran pictures paradise
as a garden, where luscious fruits drop into the mouth, the
Arabs have ever regarded Damascus, with its luxuriant orchards,
as the prototype of that blissful abode. The Rûta does not, however,
and least of all in winter, impress Europeans quite so favourably.
Yet in May, when the walnut-tree is in full leaf and the vine climbs
exuberantly from tree to tree, or still later, when the apricot-trees
in the midst of their rich carpet of green herbage bear their countless
golden fruits and the pomegranates are in the perfection of
their blossom, the gardens are truly beautiful.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> With regard to the foundation of Damascus, which like
the whole of Syria belonged from about 1500 B. C. onwards to Egypt
and to the Hittite empire (p. <a href='#Page_547'>547</a>) alternately, countless traditions are
current among the Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans. After David
had temporarily extended his sway to Damascus, there arose here, in
Solomon’s time, an independent Aramæan kingdom under Rezon (1 Kings,
xi. 23–25). In the protracted struggles between the neighbouring kingdoms
of Israel and Judah the Syrian kings generally succeeded, by means of
judicious alliances, in maintaining their independence. In the annals of
the Assyrians, who destroyed Damascus in 732, the town is called <i>Dimaski</i>
and the kingdom <i>Imîrisu</i>. From that time onwards Damascus lost its
political importance; but it continued, especially under the sway of the
Seleucides of Antioch during the period of the Diadochi, to prosper as a
trading and industrial city and as the starting-point of the caravan traffic
with Mesopotamia and Persia. When it became a Roman provincial city
it formed a political bulwark against the Arabs (Nabatæans) and Parthians.
In 611 A. D., under the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, many of its inhabitants
were carried into captivity by the Sassanide <i>Chosroes II.</i></p>

<p class='c022'>With its conquest by the Arabs in 635 begins the most brilliant period
in the history of the city. Under <i>Mûawiya</i> (661–79), founder of the dynasty
of the <i>Omaiyades</i>, the greatest of Arabian princes, it became the seat of
the caliphate. But when the <i>Abbasides</i> removed their residence to Mesopotamia
in 750 Damascus again sank to the position of a provincial town.
It fell successively into the hands of the Egyptian Tulunides and Fatimites
(p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>), and at length in 1075 succumbed to the Seljuks (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>). In 1148
it was unsuccessfully besieged by Conrad III. Under <i>Nûreddîn</i> and <i>Saladin</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_443'>443</a>) Damascus was the chief base of all the wars against the Crusaders.
During the conflicts between the Mongols, who under <i>Hûlagû</i> had captured
the city in 1260, and the Egyptian Mameluke sultans, Damascus was specially
favoured by <i>Beybars</i> (1260–77). During the great predatory expedition of
the Mongols under <i>Timur</i> (1399–1400) many scholars and artists, including
the city’s famous armourers, were exiled to Samarkand. In 1516 the
Turkish sultan <i>Selim I.</i> (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) entered the city as its final conqueror.
In 1860 there took place a great massacre of Christians in which the
Christian quarter was utterly destroyed and about 6000 Christians killed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Damascus consists of several different quarters. The <i>Jews’
Quarter</i>, as in the time of the Apostles, adjoins the ‘Straight Street’
(p. <a href='#Page_487'>487</a>), on the S.E. side of the city; to the N.E. of it is the
poor <i>Christian Quarter</i>. The other parts of the town are Moslem.
Far towards the S. stretches the suburb of <i>Meidân</i>, inhabited by
peasants. The Arabian houses in the old town are noted for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>splendour. They usually contain a spacious court, adorned with
fountains, flower-beds, orange-trees, etc., and flanked on the S. side
by a lofty open arcade (<i>lîwân</i>) with pointed arches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The population is roughly estimated at 300,000, of whom four-fifths
are Moslems, and there is a garrison of 12,000 men. The
Damascenes are notorious for their ignorance and fanaticism. The
city was once a great centre of learning, but of about a hundred
old <i>medresehs</i> or colleges five only now remain. The famous old
weaving industry of the place (still employing about 10,000 primitive
looms for silk, woollen, and cotton stuffs) is being steadily
ousted by European competition. The busy bazaar traffic here is
hardly less picturesque than at Cairo.</p>

<p class='c011'>We begin our visit at the <span class='sc'>Serâi Square</span>, the centre of business,
built over the main branch of the Baradâ (p. <a href='#Page_484'>484</a>). A <i>Monument</i>
here commemorates the opening of telegraphic communication
with Mecca.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of the square are the *<b>Bazaars</b>. Through the covered
<i>Sûk Ali Pasha</i> (fruit and tobacco) we reach the <i>Sûk el-Hamîr</i>
(donkey-market), beyond which is an open street where corn is sold.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a large plane-tree here we turn to the right to visit the
interesting <i>Sûk es-Surûjîyeh</i> (saddlers’ market), which ends near
the citadel at the <i>Sûk en-Nahhâsîn</i>. This is the bazaar of the
coppersmiths, who make the handsome <i>kursi</i>, or trays placed on
wooden stands (p. <a href='#Page_487'>487</a>) to serve as tables.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Citadel</b> (no admittance), a huge castle in the style introduced
by the Crusaders, was built in 1219 and was afterwards
restored by Beybars (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>). The thick walls stand on ancient
substructures of massive blocks. At the corners rise square towers
with bartisans. The chief gate is on the W. side.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the W. side of the Citadel the chief thoroughfare of the
city (tramway, see p. <a href='#Page_484'>484</a>) leads past the <i>Military Serâi</i> and the
<i>Hammâm el-Malikeh</i> (or <i>ed-Derwîshîyeh</i>) to the Meidân suburb
(p. <a href='#Page_487'>487</a>). On the left is the <i>Sûk el-Kharrâtin</i>, or Turners’ Market.</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite the Military Serâi is the entrance to the ‘<i>Greek
Bazaar</i>‘, a covered market restored in 1893, one of the largest in
the city. Among the wares, for which buyers can hardly offer too
little, are weapons, antiquities, clothing, pipe-stems, and ‘damascened’
daggers (made in Germany).</p>

<p class='c011'>Straight through the Greek Bazaar we come to the <i>Sûk elHamîdîyeh</i>,
also renovated, with its attractive Arabian sweetmeatshops.
A side-street leads thence (l.) to the bazaar for <i>Water Pipes</i>
(a kind of hookah smoked by the peasants) and the <i>Sûk el-Asrunîyeh</i>,
for utensils, glass, henna (p. <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>), and attar of roses (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the <i>Sûk Bâb el-Berîd</i> (on the left) we pass the almost
deserted bazaar-street of the <i>Booksellers</i> (leading to the Omaiyade
mosque, p. <a href='#Page_488'>488</a>), with an old <i>Triumphal Arch</i>; whence a double
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>row of columns once led to the ancient temple (see p. <a href='#Page_488'>488</a>). We
then turn out of the Hamîdîyeh, to the right, into the <i>Cloth Bazaar</i>
(chiefly imported goods). On the right is the <i>Tomb of Nûreddîn</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>; unbelievers not admitted).</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjoining the S. side of the mosque are the bazaar of the
<i>Joiners</i>, where we note the kabkâbs, a kind of patten, the kursistands,
and the bridal chests, and that of the <i>Goldsmiths</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the great mosque is the region of the <span class='sc'>Khâns</span> (p. <a href='#Page_445'>445</a>).
We come first to the <i>Khân el-Harîr</i>, or silk-bazaar, now that of
the furriers. Near it is the <i>House of Asad Pasha</i>, one of the finest
in the city (admittance with the aid of a dragoman). The *<i>Khân
Asad Pasha</i>, with its superb stalactite portal, is the largest of all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near this point runs the ancient ‘<span class='sc'>Straight Street</span>’ (Acts ix. 11;
now Sûk et-Tawîleh, or ‘long market’), connecting the Meidân road
with the Bâb esh-Sherki (see below). A few paces to the W., towards
the Meidân road, on the left, is the <i>Khân Suleimân Pasha</i>, for
Persian carpets and silks. On the right, where the cloth-bazaar
(see above) diverges, is the <i>Silk Bazaar</i> proper, for the sale of
keffîyehs (head-cloths, ‘kerchiefs’), table-covers, embroidery,
woollen cloaks (abâyehs) for peasants and Bedouins, etc.—We next
come to the <i>Sûk el-Attârîn</i>, or spice-market, and to the <i>Meidân
Road</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the point where we join this road rises the <b>Jâmi es-Sinânîyeh</b>,
one of the most sumptuous mosques in Damascus. The chief portal
(E. side), with its rich stalactites, and the minaret enriched with fayencetiles
(kishâni, p. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>) are interesting.</p>

<p class='c022'>The road forks farther on. We follow the Meidân Road (at first
called <i>Sûk es-Sinânîyeh</i>) to the S. Close to the <i>Jâmi el-Idein</i>, where the
Meidân Road trends somewhat to the right, we pass, on the left, the
Moslem cemetery <i>Makbaret Bâb es-Sarîr</i>, where women weep at the tombs
on Thursdays.</p>

<p class='c022'>The poor suburb of <b>Meidân</b> is modern. Its numerous mosques,
including the fine <i>Kâat el-Ûla</i>, are in a ruinous state. The sûk is frequented
by corn-dealers, whose grain is heaped up in open barns, and
by smiths. The arrival of caravans here presents a picturesque scene.
The long strings of camels are attended by ragged Bedouins. Among them
are seen Haurânians, bringing their corn to market, and here and there a
Kurd shepherd with his square felt-mantle driving his sheep to the shambles.
The Bedouins, armed with guns or with long lances, sometimes ride beautiful
horses. The wealthy Druses from Lebanon have a most imposing appearance.
Twice a year almost all these types may be seen together: on
the departure, and again, better still, on the return of the Mecca pilgrims.</p>

<p class='c022'>If time permit we may now retrace our steps to the cemetery
Makbâret Bâb es-Sarîr (see above) whence we take a short walk along
the <b>City Wall</b>, on the S.E. side of the old town, beyond the Jewish and
Christian quarters (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>). Its foundations are Roman, the central part
dates from the days of Nûreddîn and the Egyptian sultan El-Ashraf Khalîl
(1291), and the upper part from the Turkish period. Passing the camping-ground
of the caravans from Bagdad and the <i>Bâb esh-Sherki</i> (E. Gate,
originally Roman), we come to the well-preserved <i>Bâb Tûmâ</i> (St. Thomas’s
Gate). [About ¾ M. to the S. of the Bâb esh-Sherki are Christian
burial-grounds; in one of which <i>Henry Thomas Buckle</i>, the eminent
English historian (d. 1862), is interred.]</p>

<p class='c022'>Near the Bâb Tûmâ on the Aleppo road, beyond the Baradâ, are public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>gardens and pleasant cafés patronized by Christians. We return thence
to the <i>Citadel</i> (p. <a href='#Page_486'>486</a>), passing between the Baradâ and the N. side of
the town-wall, here probably Byzantine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great *<b>Omaiyade Mosque</b> (<i>Jâmi el-Umawî</i>), the finest
monument of that dynasty in Syria next to the Dome of the Rock
(p. <a href='#Page_477'>477</a>), deserves close inspection. Entrance by the W. gate
(<i>Bâb el-Berîd</i>), at the end of the booksellers’ sûk (p. <a href='#Page_486'>486</a>). Gratuity
to the sheikh who acts as guide ca. 1 mejidieh each person; addit.
charge for slippers 1–2 pias. each person.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the site of the mosque there once stood a Roman temple within
a large quadrangle. This was succeeded by the church of St. John, a
three-aisled basilica built by Emp. Theodosius I. (379–95), and so named
from the ‘head of John the Baptist’ (Arabic Yahyâ) preserved in the
Confessio, by which the Damascenes still swear. After the conquest of
the city by the Arabs (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>) the E. half of the church was assigned to
the Moslems. Caliph Welîd (705–15) deprived the Christians of the W. half
also; and in 708, with the help, it is said, of 1200 Byzantine artificers,
he transformed the church into the present mosque, which was so magnificent
that Arabian authors extolled it as one of the wonders of the world.
Adjacent to it the earliest school of learning was built by caliph Omar II.
(717–20). The mosque was carefully restored after fires in 1069, 1400,
and 1893, but its ancient glory has departed for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>We enter the great <span class='sc'>Court</span>, which with the mosque itself forms
an immense rectangle of 143 by 104 yds., and is flanked by two-storied
arcades in the Byzantine style. Behind these are the
sleeping-apartments and studies of the teachers and students.
The old marble pavement of the court, the mosaic incrustation of
the walls, and the crown of pinnacles have disappeared. The fountain
of ablution (<i>Kubbet en-Naufara</i>) and the two smaller domed
buildings are modern.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the three <span class='sc'>Towers</span> the ‘bride’s minaret’ (<i>Mâdinet el-Arûs</i>;
now being rebuilt) on the N. side of the court is said to date from
the time of Welîd. The ‘minaret of Jesus’ (<i>Mâdinet Isâ</i>), at the
S.E. angle of the mosque, recalls the Crusaders’ edifices. The
<i>Mâdinet el-Rarbîyeh</i>, at the S.W. angle, in the Egypto-Arabian
style and famed for its view, was added by Kâït Bey (p. <a href='#Page_458'>458</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span> (143 by 41 yds.), with its three span-roofs, still
has the form of an early-Christian basilica. Above each of the
two rows of columns, 23 ft. high, which separate the aisles, rises
a row of ‘colonnettes’ with round-arch openings, to which similar
round-arched windows in the outer walls correspond. In the centre
a threefold transept, with four huge pillars supporting the dome
(Kubbet en-Nisr, eagle’s dome), indicates the direction of Mecca.
The Byzantine glass-mosaics of the time of Welîd, the superb timber
ceiling, and the mihrâb and mimbar (15th cent.) were all sadly
damaged by the fire of 1893. In the central aisle on the E., over
the ‘head of John the Baptist’, rises a modern dome in wood.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the N. side of the mosque, near the <i>Bâb el-Amâra</i>, are the handsome
<i>Tomb of Saladin</i> (Kabr Salâheddîn; adm. 6 pias.) and the <i>Medreseh</i>
and <i>Tomb Mosque of Sultan Beybars</i> (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>), the latter, according to the
inscription, built by his son in 1279.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>The suburb of <b>Es-Sâlehîyeh</b> (tramway, see p. <a href='#Page_484'>484</a>), l–1/4 M.
to the N.W. of the Serâi Square, has about 25,000 inhab., mostly
descended from Seljuks, reinforced later by Kurds and by Moslem
refugees from Crete. The finest of the ruinous mosques, but not
readily shown, is the tomb-mosque of <i>Muhieddîn ibn el-Arâbi</i>
(d. 1240), adjoined by the tomb of Abd el-Kâder (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Cretan quarter at the W. end of the suburb we may
ascend, past a platform affording a good view, to the (1¼ hr.) top
of the <i>Jebel Kâsyûn</i> (3718 ft.). The *View at the small <i>Kubbet
en-Nasr</i> (‘dome of victory’) embraces the city, encircled by the
broad green belt of the oasis of the Rûta, the barren heights of Anti-Lebanon,
with the long chain of <i>Mt. Hermon</i> (9052 ft.; generally

<p class='c009'><i>Beirut</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_481'>481</a>. The French steamers make straight out to
sea in a W. direction. Astern Lebanon remains long in sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>About half-a-day’s steaming brings us in view of the mountains
of <b>Cyprus</b> (Turk. <i>Kibris</i>; pop. ca. 243,000), culminating in the
bare <i>Troodos</i> (6408 ft.). Under the Phœnicians and Greeks <i>Kypros</i>,
the third-largest island in the Mediterranean (3613 sq. M.), was
the seat of the cult of Aphrodite and the scene of a peculiar civilization,
the product of Egyptian, Phœnician, and Greek influences
in succession. In the middle ages the island was governed by kings
of the house of Lusignan and was for a time the seat of the Knights
of St. John (1292–1308; see pp. <a href='#Page_475'>475</a>, 469, 490). Since 1878 it has
been under British protectorate and only nominally Turkish.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far away to the right we see the table-shaped <i>Capo Greco</i> and
the bays of <i>Larnaka</i> and <i>Limassol</i>. We then pass, on the S. coast
of Cyprus, the prominent peninsula of <i>Akrotiri</i>, with <i>Cape Gata</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>(lighthouse) and <i>Cape Zevgari</i>. Beyond <i>Port Paphos</i> (lighthouse)
we skirt the rocky W. coast of the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the coast of <b>Asia Minor</b> (Anatolia), on a clear day, we
sight the beautiful ranges of the <i>Lycian Taurus</i> (10,500 ft.;
p. xxxiii); at night the lighthouse on the island of <i>Kasteloryzo</i> (ancient
<i>Megiste</i>), with the seaport of <i>Mandraki</i>, is sometimes visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S.E. of Rhodes we cross one of the deepest parts of the
Mediterranean (12,683 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearing <b>Rhodes</b> (562 sq. M.; ca. 30,000 inhab.), the eastmost
island of the <i>Greek Archipelago</i>, we sight its S.E. coast as far as
<i>Attáiros</i> (4068 ft.; formerly <i>Atabyrion</i>) and <i>Cape Lartos</i>. The
latter rises beyond the small bay of <i>Lindos</i>, which together with
Ialysos and Kamiros, ancient Greek towns on the N. coast, and
with Cnidus, Cos, and Halicarnassus, once formed the league of the
Doric Hexapolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French steamers call at <i>Rhodes</i> (Hôt. Karayannis, good;
Brit. vice-cons.), the capital of the island, picturesquely situated
at its N.E. point. Founded in 408 B. C. by the three older towns
(see above) it became famous in later Greek times for its navy and
for the Colossus of Rhodes, a bronze statue of Helios 112 ft. high,
which was accounted one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
The ruinous mediæval *Fortifications and the Strada dei Cavalieri,
with the old ‘Houses’ (places of assembly) of the different nations,
recall the mediæval glory of Rhodes under the sway of the Knights of
St. John (1308–1522) after their expulsion from Cyprus (p. <a href='#Page_489'>489</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We next steer through the <i>Ægean Sea</i>, where the scenery and
the historic associations are alike most attractive. We pass the
<i>S. Sporades</i>, Greek islands off the coast of ancient <i>Caria</i> and <i>Lydia</i>,
once ruled by the Knights of St. John, and now called <i>Dodekanesos</i>
(‘twelve islands’), which enjoy autonomy under Turkish suzerainty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steaming to the W.N.W. we cross the inland sea of the ancient
<i>Doris</i>, between Rhodes and Cos, noted for its sponge-fishery. On
our right lies the Anatolian peninsula of the ancient <i>Chersonesus
Rhodia</i>, with <i>Cape Alupo</i> (<i>Cynossema</i>) and the island of <i>Symi</i>
(<i>Syme</i>); to the W. rise the precipitous and fissured island of <i>Telos</i>
(<i>Tilos</i>; 2008 ft.) and the volcanic island of <i>Nisyros</i> (2268 ft.), with
its huge, still smoking crater and its hot springs. To the N.W.
stretch the long outlines of <i>Chersonesus Cnidia</i>, with the ruins of
<i>Cnidos</i> and <i>Cape Krio</i> (<i>Triopium Promontorium</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer rounds the E. coast of Cos (2871 ft.; Turk. <i>Istankiöi</i>;
not one of the Dodekanesos group), once the seat of the most
ancient shrine of Æsculapius and of a famous medical school (Hippocrates),
and passes the peninsula of <i>Budrum</i> (<i>Halicarnassus</i>).
To the W. appear in succession the islands of <i>Kalymnos</i> (2248 ft.),
<i>Leros</i> (1086 ft.), <i>Lipso</i> (902 ft.; <i>Lepsia</i>), and <i>Arki</i> (<i>Acrite</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of the island of <i>Gaïdaronisi</i> (696 ft.; <i>Tragia</i>), where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>Cæsar was captured by pirates in 76 B. C., opens the <i>Latmian Bay</i>,
belonging to the ancient <i>Ionia</i>, now silted up by the deposits of
the Mæander. A little inland are the ruins of <i>Miletus</i> and <i>Priene</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French steamers now pass through the <i>Straits of Samos</i>,
between the <i>Samsun Dagh</i> (4150 ft.; <i>Mykale</i>) and the island of
<b>Samos</b>, whose old capital, <i>Samos</i>, now <i>Tigani</i>, with its walls of
the age of Polycrates and its new harbour (1908), is seen in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Vathy</b> (Xenodochion Hegemonia tēs Samu, a good inn; pop.
9500), the new capital of Samos, lies in the bay of Scalanova (set
below), on the N. coast. Above the narrow bay rises the distant
Samsun Dagh. On the shore stands the plain palace of the Samian
princes. Since 1832 the island has formed a Christian-Greek state
under Turkey. The <i>Museum</i>, in the court of the high school, contains
antiquities from the famous shrine of Hera and from Tigani.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French vessels, soon after starting, offer a retrospect of
<i>Mt. Kerki</i> (4725 ft.; <i>Cerceteus Mons</i>), the highest in Samos, and
then cross the <i>Bay of Scalanova</i> (<i>Sinus Caystrius</i>). In the hill-country
on the mainland, to the E. of this bay, near the mouth of
the <i>Cayster</i> or <i>Kaystros</i>, once lay the rich Ionian towns of <i>Ephesus</i>
and <i>Colophon</i> and, to the N. of these, <i>Lebedus</i> and <i>Teos</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the <i>Bay of Sighajik</i> and <i>Cape Koraca</i> (<i>Carycium
Promontorium</i>) we soon reach the <i>Straits of Chios</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Alexandria</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_431'>431</a>. The <span class='sc'>Athens Steamers</span> steer to the
N.W. to the <i>Strait of Kasos</i>, 28 M. broad, lying between <i>Kasos</i>
(1706 ft.; one of the Dodekanesos group, p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>) and <i>Crete</i> (p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>).
Behind Kasos rises the lofty island of <i>Kárpathos</i> (4003 ft.; Ital.
<i>Scarpanto</i>, Turk. <i>Kerpe</i>), like the former one of the southmost of
the Sporades. Fine view of the <i>Sitía Mts.</i> (4852 ft.), continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>by the <i>Lasithi Mts.</i>, together called <i>Dikte</i> in ancient times. Off
the E. coast of Crete we see the flat islet of <i>Elasa</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We steer close by <i>Cape Sídero</i> (lighthouse), the N.E. point of
Crete, and past the <i>Gianitsades</i> (<i>Insulae Dionysiades</i>). As we
steam across the <i>Cretan Sea</i> (<i>Mare Creticum</i>) the high mountains
of Crete long remain visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next pass <i>Askania</i> (469 ft.) and <i>Christiana</i> (916 ft.), the
southmost islets of the <i>Cyclades</i> (p. xxxii), which belong to Greece,
and which, like the S. Sporades (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>) in the <i>Ægean Sea</i>, rise
from a submarine barrier running between the extremities of Attica
and Eubœa (p. <a href='#Page_529'>529</a>) and the coast of Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Christiana we have a striking view of the immense
prehistoric crater-basin formed by the islands of <i>Therasía</i> (952 ft.)
and <i>Santorin</i> (p. <a href='#Page_417'>417</a>). To the N. appear the wild rocky island
of <i>Síkinos</i> (1480 ft.) and the distant <i>Iós</i> or <i>Niós</i> (p. <a href='#Page_417'>417</a>), and to
the N.W. <i>Pholégandros</i> (1349 ft.) and the large volcanic island of
<i>Melos</i> or <i>Milos</i> (2537 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>We steer between Pholégandros on the right and <i>Polinos</i>
(1171 ft.) on the left, a broad passage marked by lighthouses at
night, and then through the strait between <i>Kímolos</i> (1306 ft.) on
the left and <i>Siphnos</i> (2280 ft.; lighthouse) on the right, both of
which, like <i>Sériphos</i> (1585 ft.; on the right; with iron-mines),
have retained their ancient Greek names.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing at some distance from <i>Thermiá</i> (1148 ft.; the ancient
<i>Kythnos</i>) and <i>Kea</i> (p. <a href='#Page_529'>529</a>) we steer close by the islet of <i>Hágios
Georgios</i> and through the <i>Bay of Ægina</i> to the <i>Piraeus</i> (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>On the <span class='sc'>Voyage to Smyrna</span> we steam to the N.N.W., 370 M. from
Alexandria, to <i>Rhodes</i> (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Rhodes on the left are the island of <i>Charki</i> (1954 ft.),
off its N.W. coast, and then <i>Telos</i> and <i>Nisyros</i> (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>). A little
farther on we pass through the strait between the <i>Syrina Group</i>,
on the left, and the islets of <i>Kandelëusa</i> and <i>Pantelëusa</i> (181 ft.;
lighthouse), adjoining Nisyros, on the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. we sight the double-peaked island of <i>Astropalia</i>
(1660 ft.; ancient <i>Astypalaea</i>) and <i>Amorgós</i> (p. <a href='#Page_417'>417</a>), and to the
E. <i>Cos</i> and <i>Kalymnos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>). Beyond the lights on the islet of
<i>Lévitha</i> (548 ft.) and beyond <i>Leros</i> (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>), at which the steamer
calls, the rocky isle of <i>Patmos</i> or <i>Patínos</i> (870 ft.), St. John’s
place of exile, becomes more conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next steer round <i>Cape Papas</i>, the W. point of the bold
island of <i>Nikaria</i> or <i>Ikaria</i> (3422 ft.), and then to the N.N.E.
through the <i>Straits of Chios</i>, 4½ M. in breadth, between the island
of <b>Chios</b> (Turk. <i>Sakis Adasi</i>; 318 sq. M. in area) and the mainland
of Anatolia or Asia Minor. The S. entrance of the straits, beyond
<i>Capo Bianco</i> (right; once <i>Argennon</i>), is flanked with the islets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>of <i>Páspargon</i> (lighthouse) and <i>Panagia</i>. On the right lies the
harbour of <i>Cheshmeh</i>, a little town with a mediæval castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now enter the harbour of <b>Kastro</b>, or <i>Chios</i> (Xenodochion
Nea Chios, a good inn; pop. about 14,000, mostly Greeks), the
capital of the island, on the E. coast. Once a most important
member of the Ionian league of cities, Chios belonged in the middle
ages to the Venetians (1204–1345), and then to the Genoese (1346–1566),
and only became Turkish under Suleiman the Great (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>).
The fruitless Greek struggle for independence ended with the
massacre of Chios in 1832. The hill-country of Chios is extremely
fertile. A valuable export is the gum of the mastic-shrub.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next pass close to the <i>Goni Islands</i>, lying in front of the
bay of <i>Lytri</i> (<i>Erythrae</i>), and the <i>Spalmatori Islets</i> (<i>Œnussae
Insulae</i>), at the N. end of the straits of Chios.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Naples (see R. 27), after half-a-day’s sail, we reach the
superb <i>Straits of Messina</i>. On the right, at the foot of the <i>Monti
Peloritani</i>, lie the ruins of <b>Messina</b> (p. <a href='#Page_156'>156</a>); to the left is <i>Reggio</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>); to the S.W. towers <i>Mt. Ætna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The German and Italian boats steer to the S.S.W. to <b>Catania</b>
(p. <a href='#Page_160'>160</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Sailing to the E.S.E., and gradually leaving Ætna behind, we
lose sight of land for a whole day. At length, on the left, we sight
the <i>Messenian Peninsula</i> of the Peloponnesus, flanked by the
<i>Œnussae Islands</i>; beyond it, the <i>Bay of Koronē</i>, the ancient
<i>Messenian Bay</i>, runs far inland. We then steer to the E. towards
<i>Cape Taenaron</i> or <i>Matapán</i> (p. xxxii), the S. point of the peninsula
of <i>Mani</i>. To the N.E. looms the bold rocky crest of <i>Mt.
Taygetos</i> (7903 ft.), whose top is free from snow in summer only.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>Beyond Cape Tænaron the <i>Bay of Marathonisi</i>, the ancient
<i>Sinus Laconicus</i>, opens to the N. We next pass between <i>Cape
Maléa</i>, notorious for its storms, and the island of <i>Kythera</i>
(1660 ft.; Ital. <i>Cerigo</i>), and turn towards the N. For a short time
we see the mountains of <i>Crete</i> (p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>) to the S.E. The bleak S.E.
coast of the Peloponnesus is now gradually left behind, while to
the right a few small rocky islands, belonging to the Cyclades
(p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>), come into sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off <i>Hydra</i> (1942 ft.; lighthouse), near the peninsula of <i>Argolis</i>,
opens the <i>Bay of Ægina</i>, the ancient <i>Saronic Gulf</i>. To the left
is the island of <i>Poros</i>; in the background rises Mt. Hágios Elias
(1748 ft.), the highest hill in <i>Ægina</i>. On the right, beyond the islet
of <i>Hagios Geōrgios</i> (1050 ft.; lighthouse), the ancient <i>Belbina</i>,
appears the hilly S. extremity of Attica with <i>Cape Colonna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_529'>529</a>).
The barren rounded hill in Attica, much foreshortened at first, is
<i>Mt. Hymettos</i>; straight in front of us is <i>Mt. Parnes</i>, forming the
N. boundary of the Attic plain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before us are the ancient <i>Mt. Ægaleos</i> (now <i>Skaramangá
Mts.</i>) and the indented coast of the island of <i>Salamis</i>, which
appears at both ends to join the mainland. Above Salamis towers
the lofty peak of <i>Geraneia</i> in Megaris. A hill jutting into the sea
in front of Mt. Ægaleos now becomes visible. This is the <i>Piraeus
Peninsula</i> (comp. Map, p. <a href='#Page_528'>528</a>). The hill a short way inland is
the <i>Munychia</i> (p. <a href='#Page_495'>495</a>), and to the right of it lies the shallow
bay of <i>Phálēron</i> (p. <a href='#Page_528'>528</a>). Between Hymettus and Parnes the
gable-shaped <i>Pentelikon</i> appears. We now have a beautiful view
of <i>Athens</i>; in the centre rises the Acropolis, on the left the monument
of Philopappos. The large white building on the right is the
royal palace, beyond which rises <i>Lykabettos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_528'>528</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>As we near the Piræus we observe the rocky islet of <i>Lipsokutáli</i>
(<i>Psyttaleia</i>; lighthouse), lying off the E. tongue of Salamis,
and masking the entrance to the straits of Salamis, the scene of the
famous battle of 480 B. C. (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>). The steamer rounds the headland

the time-honoured seaport of Athens (comp. p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>), became a mere
village after its destruction by Sulla in 86 B. C., and in the middle
ages even lost its name, but within the last few decades has developed
into a prosperous town. Its trade now exceeds that of Patras.
The harbour, the ancient <i>Kantharos</i>, admits the largest vessels.
Spacious quays, an exchange, a theatre, wide and regular streets,
and over a hundred factories have been constructed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Its antiquities are few compared with those of Athens. The
chief are parts of the fortifications, such as a wall defended by
towers, ascending the peninsula of <i>Eétioneia</i>, to the W. of the harbour.
It is reached from the station in 8 min. by walking round the
shallow N. arm of the harbour (the ‘blind harbour’ of antiquity).
On the hill it is pierced by a gateway between two round towers.</p>

<p class='c011'>A broad and easy path ascends the <i>Munychia Hill</i> (280 ft.),
to the E. of the town (20 min.), whence we overlook the various
basins of the Great Harbour, the round <i>Zea Bay</i> at the S.W.
foot of the hill, the <i>Munychia Harbour</i> at the S.E. base, and to
the E. of the latter the broad <i>Phaleron Bay</i>, where the Athenian
ships lay down to the time of the Persian wars. We may return by
the Zea Bay, noticing remains of ancient boat-houses at the beginning
of the Rue du Serangeion, and regain the station by tramway.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>From the Piræus to Athens</span> (5 M.) the electric <span class='sc'>Railway</span>
(p. <a href='#Page_503'>503</a>) is the quickest conveyance, but as it lies low and runs
through cuttings and tunnels near the city it affords little view.</p>

<p class='c011'>New-comers had better take a <span class='sc'>Carriage</span>. The new route (1½ hr.;
fare, with luggage, 8–10 dr.), though longer, is in better condition,
and is therefore preferred by the drivers. At first running alongside
the railway it reaches <i>New Phaleron</i> (p. <a href='#Page_528'>528</a>); it then skirts
the bay of Phaleron at some little distance from the shore. Later
proceeding inland it follows the broad new <i>Boulevard Syngrós</i>,
which commands an excellent view of the Acropolis and leads in a
straight line as far as the Olympieion (p. <a href='#Page_509'>509</a>).—The old route
(1¼ hr.; fare, with luggage, 6–7 dr.) follows the ‘Long Walls’
(p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>) which once connected the Piræus with Athens. On the left
is <i>Mt. Ægaleos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>), while on the right appears the bay of
Phaleron. We cross the generally dry bed of the <i>Kephisos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_505'>505</a>),
and then pass the limits of the ancient olive-grove that occupies
the plain of the Kephisos. Leaving behind a hill which conceals
the Acropolis we at once come in sight of the Theseion, the Areopagus,
and the Acropolis. The houses of the city, which we reach
at the Dipylon (p. <a href='#Page_522'>522</a>), all too soon exclude this splendid view.

<p class='c011'>Soon after leaving Brindisi we steer to the S.E. To the left of

<p class='c009'><i>Corfu</i>, Ital. <i>Corfù</i>, Greek <i>Kérkyra</i>, the capital of the island of
the same name and the seat of archbishops of the Greek and Roman
Catholic churches, is one of the wealthiest towns in the Greek dominions
(pop. 28,250, incl. 4000 Rom. Cath. and 2700 Jews). The
spacious harbour is enlivened by a brisk trade, the chief export
being olive-oil. The fortifications constructed by the Venetians, the
<i>Fortezza Vecchia</i>, picturesquely situated in the sea, on a double
rock to the E. of the town, and the <i>Fortezza Nuova</i>, on the N.W.,
are both now unimportant. The narrow streets present a busy scene.
The chief languages are Greek and Italian.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Kérkyra.</i> Lat. <i>Corcyra</i>, the largest (245 sq. M.) and most important
of the Ionian Islands, was supposed in ancient times to have been <i>Scheria</i>,
the home of the Phæaci and their king Alkinoos. Having been colonized by
the Corinthians at an early period (734 B. C.), it developed into a dangerous
rival of its mother-city, thus partly causing the Peloponnesian war.
The mediæval name seems to have been derived from ‘Korphus’, as the
old fortress on the two rocks was called. From 1386 to 1797 Corfu belonged
to Venice, from 1815 to 1863 it was under British sway, after which it
was ceded, along with the other Ionian Islands, to the kingdom of Greece.</p>

<p class='c022'>The island (with 93,860 inhab.) possesses hill and plain, bold rocks
and charming bays on the coast, abundant water-supply, rich vegetation,
and fine old olive forests, which combine to render its scenery highly
attractive. The climate is mild and equable in spring and autumn. The
good roads made everywhere by the British government add to the comfort
and enjoyment of a short stay in the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>On disembarking we cross the courtyard of the Dogana, turn
to the left at the small Hôt. de Constantinople, and follow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span><i>Strada sulle Mura</i>, which skirts the N. side of the town, affording
numerous fine views, and reaches the Esplanade near the royal palace.
Or we may ascend direct from the Dogana through the <i>Strada
Nikephoros</i>, the busy main street, in 5 min. to the Esplanade. Before
we reach the Esplanade we pass a side-street on the left with
the church of <i>Santo Spiridione</i>, and another on the right with the
<i>Teatro Vecchio</i>, built by the Venetians, now the municipio.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Esplanade</span>, or <i>Spianata</i>, lies between the town and the
old fortress. On the W. side it is bounded by handsome houses
with arcades on the groundfloor. At the N. end rises the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Royal Palace</b>, built in grey Malta stone, at the beginning
of the British period, for the Lord High Commissioner, and containing
the throne-room and the hall of the former Ionian senate.
The entrance is by the W. side-door (gratuity). A marble staircase
ascends to the first floor. At the top is an antique lion couchant.—In
front of the palace is a <i>Statue of Sir Frederick Adam</i>, a much
respected Lord High Commissioner of the islands (1823–32).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the E. end of the double avenue intersecting the Esplanade
rises a statue of <i>Count von der Schulenburg</i>, who conducted the
defence of Corfu against the Turks in 1716, erected by the republic
of Venice. Beyond it a bridge crosses a strait to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Fortezza Vecchia</b> (adm. on application), which rises on the
steep twin-rocks in terraces. The dilapidated buildings are now
used as barracks and a military hospital. At the foot of the height
is the garrison-church built by the British. The passage opposite
the chief entrance gives access to the commandant’s house. We
ascend hence to the left, pass through a long vaulted passage,
leading straight on to the ramparts, which are overgrown with
vegetation, and lastly mount a few steps to the platform on the W.
rock (230 ft.; with signalling station and lighthouse). The custodian
lends a telescope (25 l.). We enjoy here a superb **View of the
town and of the island, from Monte San Salvatore and Capo Cassopetto
on the N. to Capo Bianco on the S.; to the E. is Epirus in
Turkey, with its lofty mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>A broad street descends from the S. end of the Esplanade to the
<span class='sc'>Viale dell’ Imperatrice Elisabetta</span>, formerly <i>Strada Marina</i>,
skirting the shore below the new quarter of the town and now a
favourite promenade in the evening. At the beginning of it, on the
right, is the <i>Casino</i>, with reading and concert rooms. Turning to
the right after 4 min., and then to the left, we come to the <i>Museum</i>,
containing ancient sculptures and tomb-inscriptions. Near it is the
round <i>Tomb of Menecrates</i>, resembling a well (7th or 6th cent. B.C.).
Above is the ruined <i>Fort of San Salvatore</i> (prison).</p>

<p class='c011'>The boulevard sweeps round the suburb of <b>Kastrades</b> or
<i>Garitza</i> first to the S. and then to the E. to the Molo protecting the
bay. At a bend, short of the molo, we follow the Viale Imperatore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>Guglielmo Secondo to the right (S.). After 7 min., opposite the
apse of the old church of <i>Santa Corcyra</i>, we ascend a road to the
left. A gate on the left is the entrance to the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Royal Villa of Monrepos</b> (<i>Villa Reale</i>; free on Sun. and
Thurs. aft.). The park affords fine views of the town and castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Viale Imperatore Guglielmo skirts the W. slope of the hilly
peninsula which stretches to the S., between <i>Lake Kalikiópulo</i> and
the sea. Here probably lay the ancient city, with the bay of Kastrades
as its trading harbour, while the Lake of Kalikiopulo, now choked
with mud, seems to have been the <i>Portus Hyllaeicus</i>, used as a
station for vessels of war. The road is bordered with rose and orange
gardens, and farther on with beautiful olive-groves. In 25 min.
(or from the Esplanade in ¾ hr.) we reach a round open space,
called the *<b>Canone</b>, or <i>One-gun Battery</i> (carr. 5–6 fr.), which
commands a superb view of the E. coast of the island.</p>

<p class='c016'>Opposite, at the entrance to the ancient Hyllæan harbour, lies the
<i>Scoglio di Ulisse</i> (‘cliff of Ulysses’), or <i>Pontikonisi</i> (‘mouse island’), a
cypress-planted islet with a chapel and parsonage, now owned by an enterprising
German. The Greeks took this to be the ship of the Phæacians
which had brought Odysseus to Ithaca, and on its way back was turned into
stone by the angry Poseidon. The S.W. shore of the Lake of Kalikiopulo,
where a brook named <i>Kressida</i> enters the lake, is pointed out as the
place where Odysseus was cast ashore and met the princess Nausicaa.</p>

<p class='c009'>The charming drive to <i>Gasturi</i> and <i>Benizze</i> (7½ M.) and back
takes 3–4 hrs. (carr. 10–15 dr.; as far as the Achilleion, there and
back 2½ hrs., 8–10 dr.). We leave the town by the former W. gate,
or <i>Porta Reale</i> and pass through the suburb of <i>San Rocco</i>. The
road runs a little to the W. of Lake Kalikiopulo and ascends in
windings to (5 M.) <b>Gasturi</b> (Achilleion, pens. 7 dr.). About ½ M.
farther, a little to the left, is the villa *<b>Achilleion</b> (adm. to the
building and the grounds 11–3, 2 dr.), built in 1890–1 for Empress
Elizabeth of Austria (d. 1898), in the Italian Renaissance style, and
purchased by the German emperor in 1907. The back of the villa
is adjoined by a peristyle and three terraces adorned with statues.
On the road, just beyond the villa, is the <i>Restaurant Bella Vista</i>.
We now descend (short-cuts for walkers) to the (2 M.) fishing-village
of <i>Benizze</i>, where delicious oranges grow, and where there are
remains of a Roman villa (boat to Corfu, 5 dr.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Another delightful excursion is to <i>Santi Deca</i> (carr. 10–15 dr.;
there and back 5–6 hrs.). About ¾ M. short of Gasturi the road
diverges to the right from the Benizze road. The drive to the
village of <i>Hagi Deka</i> or <i>Santi Deca</i> (‘ten saints’; 676 ft.) takes
1¼ hr. (the walk 2 hrs.). Thence we ascend (guide) the (1 hr.)
double-peaked <b>Monte Santi Deca</b> (1862 ft.), where we have a
superb view, notably of the Albanian coast. A narrow path then
descends, the last part through olive-groves, to (½ hr.) <i>Apano-Garuna</i>,
and proceeds thence to the N. to (¼ hr.) the pass of
<i>San Teódoro</i> or <i>Hagios Theódoros</i> (788 ft.), where the carriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>quitted at Santi Deca may be ordered to meet us. The drive back
to Corfu viâ <i>Kamára</i> takes 1½ hr.</p>

<p class='c016'>The monastery of <b>Palæokastrizza</b> (‘old castle’), on the W. coast,
about 15 M. to the N.W., is a delightful point of view (carr. there and
back 20–25 dr., in 6 hrs., excl. stops). A road diverging to the right about
halfway, 1½ M. beyond the picturesque bay of <i>Govino</i>, crosses the <i>Pheleka</i>
and leads over the fine <i>San Pantaleone Pass</i> and through hill scenery
to the N. coast. Far to the right, on the E. coast, rises <i>Monte San Salvatore</i>
(Greek <i>Pantokrator</i>; 2998 ft.; ascended with guide in 3 hrs. from
<i>Spartilla</i>; carr. from Corfu to Spartilla viâ Giovino, Ipso, and Pyrgi, in
2½ hrs., about 20 dr.).</p>

<p class='c022'>See also <i>Baedeker’s Greece</i>.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>As the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> leaves Corfu the picturesque fortress remains
long in view. The highest hill on the right is <i>Monte Santi Deca</i>
(see p. <a href='#Page_499'>499</a>). The strait widens. To the left is the mouth of the
<i>Kalamas</i>; beyond it tower the Albanian Mts.; on our right is <i>Cape
Lévkimo</i>. On the left, off <i>Kavo Aspro</i> or <i>Capo Bianco</i>, the S.
point of Corfu, lie the small <i>Sybota Islands</i>, where, in 432 B. C.,
was fought the great naval battle between the Corinthians and the
Corcyræans, supported by the Athenians, which marked the outbreak
of the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 2½–3 hrs., after passing the rocky islets of <i>Paxos</i> and
<i>Antipaxos</i>, we reach the open Ionian Sea. On the mainland is
seen the little town of <i>Parga</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now leave in the distance the Epirote coast, where, off
Actium, at the mouth of the Ambracian bay, Octavian’s naval
victory over Antony in 31 B.C. gave him the sole supremacy. On
the left the island of <i>Levkás</i> (Ital. <i>Santa Maura</i>) remains long
in sight; its S.W. headland, <i>Kavo Dukato</i>, 5 M. long, ends in the
<i>Leucadian Rock</i>, which once bore a temple of Apollo. Sappho,
who loved the beautiful Phaon, is said to have thrown herself from
this rock, a leap which was supposed to cure unrequited love.</p>

<p class='c011'>We round the cape and enter the strait between Levkás and
<i>Kephallēnía</i> (Ital. <i>Cefalonia</i>). Steering to the S.E., past the E. side
of <i>Ithaca</i>, we have a good view of its beautiful mountain with a
deep depression in the middle. At the entrance to the bay of Patras
lie the <i>Oxia Islands</i>. Here in 1571 was fought the naval battle of
Lépanto, where Don John of Austria annihilated the Turkish fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearing <i>Cape Kalógria</i>, the N.W. point of the Peloponnesus,
we observe to the N., beyond a narrow strip of coast and a large
lagoon, the little town of <i>Misolonghi</i> or <i>Mesolóngion</i>, where Byron
died in 1824. Beyond it rises <i>Mt. Zygós</i> (3107 ft.), the last outpost,
to the W., of the high Ætolian range. Next, on the N. shore also,
we sight the finely-shaped <i>Varássova</i> (3007 ft.) and <i>Klókova</i>
(3415 ft.). In the Peloponnesus, to the S., tower the <i>Olonos Mts.</i>
(7300 ft.) and the <i>Voïdiá</i> (6322 ft.). Patras, completely surrounded
with currant-plantations, becomes more and more distinctly visible.</p>

in its trade by the Piræus only. Currants, the staple produce of
the Peloponnesus, and wine are the chief exports. The town was
destroyed by the Turks in 1821, and after the war of independence
was rebuilt with broad and regular streets bordered with arcades.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Patrae</i> first rose to importance under Augustus and afterwards gained
great wealth by its trade. In 1205 the Franks made it their base for the
conquest of the Peloponnesus (Morea). Since the 15th cent. it has belonged
successively to the Venetians, the Pope, the Byzantines, and the Turks,
and since 1833 to the kingdom of Greece.</p>

<p class='c009'>The main street is that of <i>Hagios Nikólaos</i> (St. Nicholas), leading
to the S.E. from the quay. The third cross-street to the right
leads to the <i>Platia Hagios Geórgios</i>, containing the theatre and
law-courts. The second side-street to the left leads to another
square with the <i>High School</i>, which contains a few ancient sculptures.
The first street to the N.E. running parallel with the Hagios
Nikólaos Street leads to the <i>Castle</i>, once Venetian, then Turkish
(now barracks and prison), which affords a fine view of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c016'>Excursion to <i>Olympia</i> by railway (5 hrs.), see <i>Baedeker’s Greece</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Railway from Patras to Athens</span> (137½ M., in 6½–9½ hrs.;
see p. <a href='#Page_496'>496</a>) is preferable to the steamers, as the traveller thus gains
several clear hours for Athens. The Corinth Canal is used by the
Società Nazionale and Achaia Co. only. The voyage round the Peloponnesus
to the Piræus (360 M.) takes more than a day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train skirts the narrow S. margin of the *<i>Gulf of Corinth</i>,
the grand mountains of which recall those of the Norwegian fiords.
Between the ruined fortresses of <i>Rhion</i> and <i>Antirrhion</i>, a little
way from Patras, the gulf narrows to 1¼ M. and soon, near <i>Naupaktos</i>,
contracts again. 25 M. <i>Ægion</i> (Buffet); 33 M. <i>Diakophto</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>whence a rack-and-pinion line mounts the hills inland. Then, above
two deep bays on the N. bank, towers Mt. Parnassus. At the E.
end of the gulf lies (81 M.) <i>Corinth</i> (halt of ¼ hr.; Buffet, déj. 4 dr.).
In the isthmus of Corinth the train crosses the Corinth Canal (3¾ M.
long, 25 yds. wide, 26 ft. deep) by a bridge 170 ft. high, and then
skirts the N. bank of the <i>Saronic Gulf</i> (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>). On the right the
eye ranges as far as the mountains of the Argolis peninsula and
Ægina. Beyond (108 M.) <i>Megara</i> we near the N. coast of Salamis.
Beyond (120½ M.) <i>Eleusis</i> the train turns inland and passes through
the depression between (r.) Mt. Ægaleos (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>) and (l.) Mt. Parnes
into the Attic plain. Arrival at (137½ M.) <i>Athens</i>, Peloponnesian
Station, see below (hotel-agents in waiting; carr. 2 dr.).</p>

<hr class='c017'>

<p class='c011'>Most <span class='sc'>Steamers</span> (see p. <a href='#Page_501'>501</a>) set out in a W. direction from the
Gulf of Patras, holding straight out to Kephallenia and keeping
distant Ithaca to the right. They then steer to the S. between the
promontory of <i>Chelonatas</i>, the W. point of the Peloponnesus, and the
island of <i>Zante</i> or <i>Zakynthos</i>. Beyond the cape and the little harbour-town
of <i>Katakolo</i>, the calling-place for <i>Pyrgos</i> and <i>Olympia</i>
(p. <a href='#Page_501'>501</a>), the coast recedes and forms the sweeping curve of the
<i>Gulf of Kyparissia</i>; behind rise the heights of the <i>Lykaeon</i>
(4659 ft.). Later on we pass the <i>Strophades</i> on the right. At the
extremity of the Gulf of Kyparissia the <i>Ægaleon</i> (4003 ft.) marks
the beginning of the Messenian Peninsula. The steamers double
the S. point and from here to the Piræus their course is the same
as that of the Naples boats (see pp. <a href='#Page_493'>493</a>, 494).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Athens</i> (130–492 ft.; pop. 167,500), modern Greek <i>Athénai</i>, lies
3¾ M. from the <i>Saronic Gulf</i>, in the great Attic plain, which is
closed on the W. by <i>Ægaleos</i> and <i>Parnes</i> and on the E. by <i>Hymettos</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>and <i>Pentelikon</i>. The city is bounded on the S.E. by the <i>Ilissos</i> and
on the W. by the <i>Kephisos</i>. The valleys of these streams are separated
by the <i>Turkovuni</i> hills, whose S. spur, the <i>Lykabettos</i>, rises
abruptly above Athens on the E. A broad saddle separates the latter
from the rock of the <i>Acropolis</i> and a group of hills farther to the W.;
these include the <i>Philopappos</i> or <i>Museion</i>, the <i>Pnyx</i>, and the
<i>Nymphs’</i> hills, and slope gently down to the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Athens of antiquity circled round the Acropolis and included
the hills on its S.W. and W. sides (see Plan, where traces
of ancient walls and the probable direction of the streets are indicated).
The modern city extends to the N. of the Acropolis, far
towards the plain of the Kephisos. Down to 1834 Athens was a poor
village. Now, as the capital of the kingdom of Hellas, it has developed
into one of the finest cities of the E. Mediterranean, and is
quite European in character.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main street is the <i>Rue du Stade</i>, connecting the <i>Syntagma
Square</i> (Place de la Constitution; Pl. F, 5, 6) with the <i>Omónia
Square</i> (Place de la Concorde; Pl. D, 2, 3). This street and the
broad E. end of the Rue d’Hermès (see below) contain the principal
shops. The Syntagma Square forms the centre of traffic. Parallel with
the Rue du Stade runs the <i>Boul. de l’Université</i> (<i>Panepistēmion</i>),
in which the chief public buildings are situated. This new E. quarter,
known as <i>Neapolis</i>, is adjoined, to the W. of the Rue du Stade, by
the older business quarter, the main arteries of which are the <i>Rue
d’Hermès</i> (Pl. B-E, 5; p. <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>), running to the W. from the Syntagma
Square, and the <i>Rue d’Athéna</i> (Pl. D, 3–5), running from the
Place de la Concorde to the S. and intersecting the Rue d’Hermès
at right angles. Parallel to the latter is the <i>Rue d’Eole</i> (p. <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>),
which leads to the N., past the National Museum, to Patisia, and
is prolonged to the S. to the Tower of the Winds at the foot of the
Acropolis. The Piræus is the chief seat of industry and the wholesale
trade.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> The Athenians prided themselves on being the aboriginal
inhabitants of the country, whose earliest kings are said to have been
Cecrops, builder of the Acropolis, Erechtheus, Pandion, and Ægeus. Research,
however, attributes the earliest settlement on the Acropolis to the
<i>Pelasgians</i>, afterwards expelled by Ionian invaders. <i>Theseus</i>, the fifth
king, is regarded as the actual founder of Athens. To him Thucydides
assigns the Synœkismos (in 1259 B.C., it is said) or subordination of all
the Attic communities to Athens as their capital. Originally consisting
of the Acropolis only, the city gradually extended in all directions.</p>

<p class='c022'>After the self-sacrifice of Kodros (1068 B.C.) the kings were succeeded
by <i>Archons</i>, first of the house of Kodros and afterwards elected from the
ranks of the Eupatridæ (landed nobles). Internal dissensions and the
capricious rule of this aristocratic oligarchy led at the end of the 7th cent.
to the codification of the existing law of Athens by <i>Drakon</i>, a measure
succeeded in 594 B.C. by the democratic reforms of <i>Solon</i>. Eligibility
for the highest offices was henceforth to depend, not on birth, but on
the possession of property and the payment of taxes (‘timocracy’). The
judges were to be chosen by lot, and a council (Boulē) of 400 members
(Bouleutæ) was placed over the archons as the supreme governing body.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>In 561 B.C., however, while Solon was still alive, <i>Peisistratos</i>, an
ambitious but humane man and a patron of art, succeeded in usurping
the position of tyrant. He and his sons <i>Hippias</i> and <i>Hipparchos</i> brilliantly
developed the city. Roads were made to the various ‘demoi’ or
communities of Attica, and a copious supply of water was brought by a
subterranean conduit from Hymettos. The Olympieion was begun, the
ancient temple of Athena on the Acropolis, the ‘hekatompedon’, was enclosed
with a colonnade, and other large buildings were erected. All
this splendour, however, did not compensate for the want of a free constitution;
in 514 Hipparchos was assassinated by Harmodios and Aristogeiton
and in 510 Hippias was banished with the aid of the Spartans.
After further democratic reforms, and after various wars with adjoining
states, which led to the development of the Athenian fleet, the little Attic
state obtained the leadership of the whole nation in the Persian wars.
In order to punish Athens for supporting the revolt of the Greek towns
in Asia Minor (498), <i>Darius I.</i>, king of Persia, sent an army of over
200,000 men with a huge fleet, under <i>Datis</i> and <i>Artaphernes</i>, across the
Ægean Sea in 490. Contrary to all expectation the Athenians under
<i>Miltiades</i>, assisted by the Platæans only, defeated the immense Persian
army on the plains of Marathon. Even more glorious, and still further
confirming the hegemony of Athens, was the result of the campaign of
<i>Xerxes</i> against Greece in 480. After the heroic resistance of Leonidas
and his Spartans at Thermopylæ had been overcome by the slaughter of
the devoted band the whole of the huge army and armament of the Great
King bore down upon Attica to avenge the defeat of Marathon. The
Athenians took to their ships. The city was occupied by the Persians,
the Acropolis captured, and the temples burned down. But the decisive
naval victory won at Salamis (480), and due to the unflinching courage
and pertinacity of <i>Themistokles</i>, broke the power of the Persians. The
citizens had scarcely re-entered Athens when they were again compelled
to retire before the army of <i>Mardonios</i>, but their great victory at Platæa
in 479 finally relieved them from the menace of a Persian yoke.</p>

<p class='c022'>Having taken the most glorious part in these terrible struggles Athens
now became the natural leader of the Greeks in the war of retaliation.
In 474 this leadership found expression in the foundation of the Attic
and Delian naval league. The zenith of the Athenian power coincided
with the rebuilding of the city, which progressed rapidly in spite of the
opposition of the Spartans. The fortification both of the city and its
harbour, which the genius of Themistokles had removed to the Piræus,
was taken in hand with special vigour, and in 460–445 the ‘Long Walls’
were erected, stretching from the Piræus and from Phaleron to Athens
itself. Next, under the rule of <i>Perikles</i>, arose the magnificent buildings
on the Acropolis. A colossal statue of Athena Promachos in gold and
ivory, by Phidias, was erected out of the Persian booty in 438, when the
cella of the great Parthenon also was probably completed. In 437–432
were erected the stately Propylaea, and lastly the Erechtheion, begun
probably soon after the peace of Nikias (421) but not completed till 407.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Athenian democracy had attained its fullest development and its
widest sway when the long-standing antagonism of Sparta led to open
war between the rival states in 431. In the second year of the war
Athens was visited by a terrible plague, which carried off, among many
others, Perikles, the only man of genius powerful enough to control the
democracy, the deterioration of which may be dated from his death.
After many vicissitudes, including the disastrous campaign in Sicily
undertaken by the advice of <i>Alkibiades</i> (comp. p. <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>), the Peloponnesian
war ended in 404 with the utter humiliation of Athens. The fortifications
of the city and the Piræus had to be demolished, the fleet to be given
up, and an oligarchic government, that of the ‘Thirty Tyrants’, to be
endured at the bidding of Sparta. In 403 <i>Thrasyboulos</i> restored the
democracy; in 393 <i>Konon</i> won a naval victory over the Spartans at
Knidos, and rebuilt the Long Walls; but all this was but a brief and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>feeble reflex of the ancient glory of the state. In vain <i>Demosthenes</i> exhorted
his fellow-citizens to vigorous resistance against <i>Philip of Macedon</i>;
when they at last roused themselves it was too late. In 338 Greek independence
received its death-blow on the battle-field of Chæronea.</p>

<p class='c022'>Although Athens never again recovered her political importance her
material prosperity survived almost unimpaired for several centuries more.
In the year of the battle of Chæronea began the judicious financial administration
of the orator <i>Lykourgos</i>, who completed the theatre previously
begun on the S.E. slope of the Acropolis, built the Stadion, and filled the
arsenals and harbour of the Piræus with military stores and with ships.
After a fruitless revolt in 322 (the ‘Lamian War’) Athens was garrisoned
with Macedonian troops. Yet Athens continued to live and thrive on the
intellectual heritage stored up within her walls ever since the days of
the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. As the home of the greatest poets
of antiquity, as the seat of the far-famed schools of philosophy and rhetoric
founded by Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno, and as a great centre of art
and architecture, she still had many visitors and admirers. Foreign patrons
lavished gifts upon her or erected sumptuous buildings in the city.
To Ptolemy Philadelphos of Egypt (281–246) she owed a gymnasion with
a library, to the Pergamenian kings handsome colonnades, and to the
Syrian king Antiochos IV. Epiphanes (175–164) the Olympieion.</p>

<p class='c022'>The dominion of Macedonia was followed by that of Rome, in spite
of the nominal declaration of the independence of Greece made by the consul
Flamininus in 196 B.C. After the overthrow of the Achæan League, of
which Athens was a member, and the destruction of Corinth in 146 Greece
and Macedonia were formed into a Roman province. Athens had to pay
heavily for the ill-considered help it afforded Mithridates, King of Pontus,
who chose Greece as the battle-field on which to contest with Rome the
sovereignty of Asia. The city was stormed and sacked by <i>Sulla</i> in 86 B.C.,
and the fortifications of the Piræus were finally demolished. The city
was, however, favoured by Cæsar and the Roman emperors. The chief
buildings of this period are the Tower of the Winds, the Market Gate
owing its origin to donations made by Cæsar and Augustus, the statue of
Agrippa, the round temple of Roma and Augustus, the new marble steps
of the Propylæa, and the monument of Philopappos.</p>

<p class='c022'>A new period in the history of art was inaugurated by <i>Hadrian</i>
(A.D. 117–38), the friend of Greece, to whom countless statues were erected
under the titles of the Olympian, the Founder, the Liberator. A whole
quarter of the city, to the S.E. of the castle, was called after him, as
may still be read on Hadrian’s Arch. In this quarter rose the temple
of Zeus completed by him. In the old town he founded a library, a
gymnasion, and a pantheon, and Athens is still supplied with water by
his aqueduct. At the same period <i>Herodes Atticus</i> (101–77), a rich citizen,
built the odeion named after him. Lastly <i>Marcus Aurelius</i> (161–80), from
whose time dates the description of the city by Pausanias, summoned
new teachers to the Athenian school of philosophy. From that period
begins the gradual stagnation and decay of the city.</p>

<p class='c022'>In 267 Athens was captured by the Heruli and Goths. In 395 and 396
<i>Alaric</i> with his Visigoths appeared before its gates, but spared it on
payment of tribute. From the 5th cent. onwards numerous works of art
were removed from Athens to Constantinople, as had been partly done
by Constantine himself, to grace the buildings of New Rome. In 529
<i>Justinian</i> gave the death-blow to the intellectual life of Athens by closing
the schools of philosophy. Athens sank to the position of a Byzantine
provincial town. In 1019 <i>Basil II.</i> held a triumphal festival in the
Parthenon, which had long been used as a church. In 1040 the Northmen
under Harald Haardraade took the Piræus by storm.</p>

<p class='c022'>After the conquest of Constantinople by the <i>Latin Crusaders</i> in 1204
(p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) Athens fell into the hands of Frankish nobles known as dukes
after 1258. At length, in 1456, after a vigorous defence, Athens was
captured by the <i>Turks</i>, and thenceforth belonged to the pashalik of Negroponte
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>(Eubœa). But two events in the next three centuries and a half
deserve mention; it was attacked by the Venetians in 1466 and it was
captured and occupied for a short time by their general Francesco Morosini
in 1687. On the latter occasion the Parthenon, hitherto uninjured, was
blown up, while the Propylæa had already been destroyed by an earlier
explosion (comp. p. <a href='#Page_513'>513</a>). Athens then fell into complete oblivion and
had to be rediscovered by the explorers and scholars of the 19th century.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Greeks began their war of independence in 1821, and in 1822
captured the Acropolis of Athens. The Turks, however, stormed the
town in 1826, and in 1827 took the Acropolis also after a brave resistance.
The whole of Hellas thus fell again under the Turkish yoke. But the
Great Powers now intervened. In 1833 the Acropolis was evacuated by
the Turks, and entered by the Bavarian troops of the new king, <i>Otho</i>.
In 1834 Athens was made the capital of the new kingdom, and since 1835
has been the seat of government. This distinction it owes to its historic
fame, its site being geographically and economically unfavourable for a
great modern city. It has attracted neither wholesale trade nor industry,
and Attica itself is by no means productive.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Books.</span> Of the extensive literature on Athens the following books

<h4 class='c023'>a. Walk from the Palace round the S. Side of the Acropolis.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The <span class='sc'>Place de la Constitution</span>, or <i>Syntagma Square</i> (Pl. F,
5, 6; p. <a href='#Page_505'>505</a>), with its hotels and cafés, is bounded by gardens on
the E., beyond which rises the <b>Royal Palace</b> (Pl. F, G, 5, 6),
built of limestone and Pentelic marble (1834–8), with a Doric
portico. The trellised walks of the palace-garden (Pl. F, G, 6;
entr. to the right, in the Rue de Képhisia; adm. Wed. and Frid.,
4–6, in winter 3–5; smoking prohibited) afford shady promenades;
from the S. part, with its fine palms, we get picturesque glimpses
of the columns of the Olympieion, the Acropolis, and the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Syntagma Square the broad Rue des Philhellènes leads
to the S., past the Russian Church and the <i>English Church</i> (Pl. F,
6, 7), a tasteful Gothic edifice, to the beautiful grounds of the
<b>Záppion</b> (Pl. F, 7), an exhibition-building opened in 1888.</p>

<p class='c016'>The two statues adorning the flight of steps represent the brothers
Zappas, who founded the building. At the W. angle of the grounds is
a pleasing <i>Statue of Byron</i> (Pl. E, 7). Café on the Terrace (p. <a href='#Page_503'>503</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>To the S. we have a view of the sea; to the E. (left) rises Hymettos.
In the foreground, adjoining the Olympieion (p. <a href='#Page_509'>509</a>),
is *<b>Hadrian’s Arch</b> (Pl. E, 7), erected either by himself or his
successor. This gateway, 14½ yds. broad and 59 ft. high, marked,
as the inscriptions record, the boundary between the older quarters
and the new town of Hadrian (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>). It was adorned with projecting
Corinthian columns, of which fragments of the bases and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>the entablature alone survive. Above the gateway rises an attica
with three window-like apertures and a pediment in the centre.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Olympieion</b> (Pl. E, F, 7, 8), or <i>Temple of the Olympian
Zeus</i>, has been entirely destroyed with the exception of fifteen
huge marble columns. The original temple dates from the time
of Peisistratos (ca. 530 B.C.; p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>), but scarcely more than the
foundations were then built. The work was resumed, ca. 174 B.C.,
by Antiochos IV. Epiphanes, to whose edifice the existing ruins
belong, but it was completed only by Hadrian. When the temple
was consecrated (ca. 129 A.D.) the Athenians showed their gratitude
by erecting a statue of the emperor next to the gold and ivory statue
of Zeus. The temple rose on a basis (118 by 45 yds.) approached
by three steps, and was the largest Greek temple in existence after
those of Ephesus and Selinus. The W. and E. ends were flanked
with triple rows of eight columns, and the N. and S. sides with
double rows of twenty; in all there were 104 Corinthian columns,
56½ ft. high and 56–67 inches in diameter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The precincts of the temple consisted of a large levelled platform,
created by Hadrian, 224 by 141 yds., which had to be backed
up on the W. side and at the S.E. corner, where it is buttressed
with huge substructions. On the N. side, in a line with the E. front
of the temple, an entrance with four columns has been unearthed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The view stretches from Hymettos to the sea, with the islands of
Ægina and Hydra and the coast of Argolis.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Olga Boulevard (Pl. E-G, 7, 8), on the bank of the <i>Ilissos</i>
(generally dry), leads to the E. from the Olympieion to the Stadion
bridge. Opposite the bridge is the old <i>Protestant Cemetery</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Stadion</b> (Pl. G, H, 8; adm. 20 l.), the scene of the Panathenæan
games, situated in a natural basin, was planned by Lykourgos
(p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>) in 330 B.C. The seats and balustrades in Pentelic
marble were added, about 140 A.D., by Herodes Atticus (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>).
The great size of the Stadion and the height of its rows of seats
produce a very imposing effect, and this is enhanced by the rich
marble decorations, which were renewed in 1896–1906. On its
completion the building was inaugurated in 1906 with Olympic
games, which are to be held here every four years. The entrance
consists of a Corinthian propylæum. The race-course, ascending
slightly, is 224 yds. long as far as the semicircular space at the
S.E. end (sphendonē), and 36½ yds. in breadth. Exclusive of barriers
and corridor, the actual course was 600 Græco-Roman or 584
Engl. ft. (195 yds.) long, and was divided into sections by <i>metae</i>
or goals, consisting of double hermæ, two of which have been re-erected
at the semicircular space. The course is separated by a
marble parapet from a corridor, 3 yds. wide, affording access to
the lower tiers of seats. These are 24 in number, and higher up,
separated from them by a broad passage, are 20 rows of benches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>above which runs another passage overlooking the whole and protected
on the outside by a parapet. There is accommodation for
50,000 spectators.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Hadrian’s Arch the short Rue de Lysicrate leads to the
N.W. to the beautiful choragic *<b>Monument of Lysikrates</b>
(Pl. E, 7), resembling a small round temple. This is the oldest well-preserved
monument in the Corinthian style, and once served as
the library of that French Capuchin Convent where Lord Byron
spent a night. According to the inscription above the half-columns
on the S.E. side, it was erected in 335–334 by a certain Lysikrates
who had won the victory in the Dionysian games. On a cubic
basement rises a round building in Pentelic marble, 21½ ft. high,
with six Corinthian half-columns which support a tripartite architrave
and sculptured frieze. The conical roof, consisting of a
single slightly convex block of marble, is crowned with a vigorous
acanthus flower, on which once stood the bronze tripod won by
Lysikrates. The frieze, which dates from the prime of the school
of Praxiteles, represents in very low relief, partly obliterated, the
punishment of the Tyrrhenian pirates who had robbed Dionysos;
before the god converts them into dolphins, they are being tormented
in every possible way by his attendant satyrs.</p>

<p class='c011'>We return by the Rue de Byron (to the S.) to Amalia Street,
in line with which the <span class='sc'>Dionysios Areopagites Street</span> (Pl. D, C, 7)
ascends to the Acropolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Theatre of Dionysos</b> (Pl. D, 7), whose entrance we
soon reach, was once the centre of the dramatic art of Greece, the
spot in which the masterpieces of Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides,
and Aristophanes first excited delight and admiration. From the
early 5th cent, this site was occupied by a round enclosed orchestra
(‘dancing place’), while for each performance a stage had to be specially
erected, the audience being seated in a levelled hollow in
the Acropolis hill-side. In the 4th cent., mainly in the time of Lykourgos
(p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>), tiers of stone seats and a permanent stage were
erected for the first time. The present semicircular orchestra, paved
with marble, and the remains of the stage-building belong to Roman
restorations. The Roman raised stage rested on a wall adorned
with good sculptures of the time of Nero. During the Greek age
the actors and the chorus, the former wearing the raised cothurnus,
performed on the level space in the orchestra, while the skēnē or
stage served them as a kind of booth. The proskēnion, or wooden
front of the stage, formed the background of the play, and was only
superseded by a stone wall with columns at the close of the late
Hellenistic period. Between the rectangular wings of the stage
(paraskēnia) and the lowest seats for the spectators opened the
entrances for the chorus (párodoi). The auditorium was divided by
narrow flights of steps into 13 ‘wedges’ (kerkides) and by two cross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>passages (diazomata) into three main sections. The seats, originally
for 14–17,000 spectators, are only partly preserved. In the front row
were marble seats for the priests and state officials; that in the centre,
set apart for the priest of Dionysos, is adorned with reliefs. The
pedestal to the right, behind it, bore the throne of Hadrian.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjoining the theatre was the <i>Sacred Precinct of Dionysos
Eleuthereus</i>, the wine-dispensing god, with whose festivals the
dramatic performances were connected. The walls of his temple
(5th or early 4th cent.) are still partly preserved between the stage
of the theatre and the modern street. Behind the stage ran a colonnade
offering shelter in rainy weather; at its S.W. end once stood
an older temple, the N.W. corner of which has been discovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ancient buildings to the W. of the theatre of Dionysos skirt
the hill-side in two terraces. The E. half of the upper terrace, on the
steep slope of the castle-hill, above the conspicuous arched wall, is
the site of the famous <b>Asklepieion</b>, or sacred precinct of Asklepios
(Æsculapius), Hygieia, and kindred deities, with which institutions
for the treatment of the sick were connected. Of the temple, founded
in 420, the foundations only are left. The perpendicular side of
the Acropolis is here faced with masonry, in which is the entrance
to a round well-house converted into a chapel. In front of it ran
a colonnade towards the W., leading to a round pit, once roofed
over, which is supposed to have been used for sacrificial purposes
or as the abode of the sacred serpents.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the lower terrace, from the theatre to the Odeion, ran the
<i>Stoa of King Eumenes II.</i> of Pergamon (B.C. 197–159), 180 yds.
long, with its back to the masonry supporting the upper terrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Odeion of Herodes Atticus</b> (Pl. C, 7; keys kept by
a pensioner, in the red hut at the W. entrance; 25–50 l.), founded
by a rich citizen (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>; about 160 A.D.), dominates all the other
ruins at the foot of the castle-hill. Unlike the usual odeon or theatre
for musical entertainments, this building was constructed with a
view to dramatic performances. The yellowish-brown façade is
constructed in the Roman round-arched style and consisted of three
stories. The usual entrance is by the westmost of the three doors.
A niche here contains the statue of a Roman official.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Interior</span> affords a good example of a Roman theatre (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_510'>510</a>). The stage (logeion), raised 3½ ft. above the orchestra, is 38½ yds.
in breadth, but only 6 yds. deep. At the back of the stage is a massive
wall, broken by the usual three stage-doors and relieved by niches and
a row of columns. The orchestra, 20 yds. wide, was paved with particoloured
squares of marble. The auditorium, 83 yds. in diameter, could
hold 5000 spectators. The tiers of seats rise in a semicircle, one above the
other, on the rocky slope of the Acropolis. The lower 19 tiers were divided
by steps into five, the upper (probably 13), above the transverse passage
(see p. <a href='#Page_510'>510</a> and above), into ten sections. The seats, like the whole of the
masonry, were coated with Pentelic marble; the lowest tier had backs.
The whole edifice was covered with a superb roof of cedar-wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Dionysios Areopagites Street (p. <a href='#Page_510'>510</a>), where it passes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>the Odeion, there diverges to the W. the avenue leading to the
Acropolis, immediately to the right of which a steep path ascends
on the W. side of the Odeion to the Acropolis gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Halfway up we diverge to the left to visit the summit of a
rocky plateau (377 ft.) separated from the Acropolis by a depression,
and descending abruptly to the N.E., still called as in ancient
times the <b>Areopagus</b> (Pl. B, C, 6). A narrow flight of steps in
the rock, partly destroyed, ascends to the site of some ancient altars,
for which platforms were hewn in the rock. Here met the time-honoured
court of justice, composed of noble and aged citizens
who wielded supreme criminal jurisdiction. The cleft in the rock
below the N.E. corner was probably connected with the cult of the
avenging <i>Erinyes</i> (Furies), or <i>Eumenides</i> (the benevolent), as they
were euphemistically called. This was the scene of Æschylus’s
famous tragedy of that name.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the S.W. of the Areopagus rock, and below (to the E. of) the modern
road from the Theseion (p. <a href='#Page_521'>521</a>) to the Acropolis, the <span class='sc'>Oldest Quarter
of the Lower Town</span> has been partly excavated (comp. Pl. B, 7, and
p. <a href='#Page_524'>524</a>). Descending at the W. point of the Areopagus rock from the
modern to the ancient road, we reach, on the left, the <span class='sc'>Dionysion en
Limnais</span> (Pl. B, 7), a triangular space enclosed by an antique polygonal
wall of limestone. This was the sacred precinct of Dionysos Lenæos,
the inventor of the wine-press, and once contained a temple of the 7th
or 6th cent. B.C., a wine-press (in the N.W. angle), and a large hall of
the Roman period (in the N.E. half).</p>

<p class='c022'>To the S. of the temple-precinct lay the <i>City Well of Kallirrhoë</i>.
Peisistratos connected it with his aqueduct from the upper Ilissos valley,
and provided it with nine spouts, whence it was called <i>Enneákrunos</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. The Acropolis.</h4>

<p class='c016'>The abrupt limestone plateau (512 ft.) on which stands the <i>Acropolis</i>,
or castle of Athens, has formed from hoar antiquity the nucleus of all
the settlements in the Attic plain. The legendary Pelasgi are said to
have first levelled the top of the hill, enclosed it with a wall, and erected
the so-called <i>Enneápylon</i>, an outwork with nine gates, to defend the sole
approach on the W. side. The Acropolis contained the residence of the
kings and the chief sanctuaries of the state. The kings afterwards transferred
their seat to the lower city, Peisistratos alone preferring to reside
in the Acropolis. The ancient buildings were destroyed by the Persians
in 480–479. Themistokles and Kimon rebuilt the walls, and Perikles then
became the chief founder of those magnificent buildings which, even in
their ruins, still present the finest picture of the unrivalled art of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c022'>Tramway, see p. <a href='#Page_503'>503</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The avenue mentioned above which ascends to the W. at the
Odeion of Herodes Atticus brings us to the so-called Beulé Gate,
on the plateau below the last steep W. slope of the **<b>Acropolis</b>.
Carriages stop here. Visitors admitted till sunset.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Beulé Gate</span>, named after the French savant who discovered
it, was entirely built over by bastions down to 1852, but since
1889 has formed the chief entrance to the Acropolis (side-entrance
under the Nike bastion). The towers flanking the gateway were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>built about 50 A.D.; the gateway itself dates from 160 A.D. and
is embellished with fragments from a choragic monument erected
by Nikias in 319.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Beulé Gate we ascend a flight of marble steps, with
many gaps, to the Propylæa. This staircase, which also was made
in the first half of the 1st cent. A.D., replaces the steep ancient track.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tower-like pedestal on the left, below the Propylæa, once bore a
<i>Statue of M. Vipsanius Agrippa</i>, the general and son-in-law of Emp.
Augustus, erected between 27 and 12 A.D.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the right of the Propylæa projects a bastion, 26 ft. high,
from which a small flight of marble steps descends, stopping short
of our staircase. On this bastion rises the *<b>Temple of Nike</b>
(Athena Nike, erroneously called Nike Apteros), which was reconstructed
with the ancient stones in 1835–6. Its date is uncertain
(probably between 440 and 410 B.C.).</p>

<p class='c016'>Like the Propylæa this little temple, 27 ft. long and 18 ft. wide, is
built entirely of Pentelic marble. It stands on a basement of three steps,
and is preceded at the E. and W. ends by a portico of four Ionic columns
13 ft. high. Above the tripartite architrave runs a sculptured frieze 85 ft.
long and 18 inches high. At the E. end it represents a council of the gods,
among whom are Athena with her shield (in the centre) and Zeus (sitting)
next to her. On the sides are battles of the Greeks with the Persians
(some of them mounted). At the W. end is a conflict between Greeks
and Greeks. Only a few fragments of the roof have been found; it ended
on the E. and W. in pediments which were unadorned. The entrance to
the cella is formed by two pillars.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the marble cornice of the temple bastion there once rose a
<i>Balustrade</i> adorned with reliefs outside, and bearing a bronze
railing. These admirable reliefs, remains of which are preserved
in the Acropolis Museum (p. <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>), represented goddesses of victory
erecting trophies and presenting offerings in presence of Athenä.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<span class='sc'>View</span> from beside the Temple of Nike is justly celebrated. In
the picturesque intermingling of land and sea we descry the bay of Phaleron
(p. <a href='#Page_528'>528</a>), the peninsula of Munychia, the Piræus (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>), Salamis, and its
adjoining islet of Psyttaleia (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>). A little farther to the right, beyond
the bay of Eleusis, appears the dome-like rock of Acro-Corinth, backed by
distant mountains. To the right of this, but in the immediate foreground,
rises the Pnyx Hill with its rock-steps. The plain is overgrown with fine old
olive-groves. Above it rise Mt. Ægaleos and the hills of Megara. To the
S.W., to the left of the tower-like monument of Philopappos, stretches the
Saronic Gulf, bounded by Ægina, with Mt. St. Elias, and by the Argolic
Mts. and the island of Hydra. To the left runs the Attic coast as far as
the islet of Gaïdaronisi, off Cape Colonna.</p>

<p class='c009'>The **<b>Propylæa</b>, the greatest secular edifice in ancient Athens,
composed entirely of Pentelic marble, were erected in 437–432 B.C.
by the architect <i>Mnesikles</i>. This highly artistic building consists
of three parts—a central gateway with wings on the N. and S.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Central Building</span>, ruined by an explosion in 1645, consists
of a wall pierced with five openings and preceded by Doric
colonnades on the E. and W. sides. Each colonnade has six columns
in front, above which ran a frieze of triglyphs and metopes, crowned
by a plain pediment. The <i>W. Colonnade</i>, to which three huge steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>ascend, is 19 yds. wide and 17 yds. deep. Its front columns belong
to the Doric order and consequently rise directly from the ground
(stylobate), without bases; they are 29 ft. high, and each is fluted
with twenty grooves separated by sharp edges. Behind the two
central columns, which are 12½ ft. apart, and flanking the main
passage there are on each side three slender Ionic columns, 33 ft.
high, resting on their cushion-like bases, and grooved with twenty-four
flutes separated by broad fillets. The ceiling was divided into
sunk panels adorned with painting.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. and S. sides the central building was bounded by
massive walls, 17½ yds. long, ending in huge buttresses (antæ).
Between these extended the <i>Gateway</i> proper consisting, as above
remarked, of a wall with five openings. Five marble steps ascend
to the threshold, composed of black Eleusinian stone, on which the
side-gates rest. The broad central gateway is without steps. All the
gateways were once provided with massive folding doors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>E. Colonnade</i> is as broad as the other, but only 23 ft.
deep. Of its six Doric columns five still have their capitals, and
two are connected with their architrave.</p>

<p class='c011'>The well-preserved <span class='sc'>North Wing</span> consists of a porch or vestibule,
open towards the S., with three Doric columns between antæ,
and an inner hall connected with it by a door and two windows.
This was called the <i>Pinakotheka</i>, from its use as a receptacle for
votive pictures (‘pinakes’) on marble or terracotta. The <span class='sc'>South
Wing</span>, of which two columns and the back-wall only have been
preserved, was never quite completed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing through the E. Colonnade of the Propylæa we enter the
<span class='sc'>Inner Ward</span> of the Acropolis and ascend a gradual slope, now covered
with profoundly impressive ruins. When we picture to ourselves
the mighty Parthenon, on the right, and the exquisite Erechtheion
on the left, in the full glory of their sculptures and colouring,
surrounded by smaller sanctuaries and a forest of statues, we may
well understand the enthusiastic pride of the Athenians in their
unrivalled Acropolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the central gateway of the Propylæa a broad pathway
ascends along the main axis of the citadel. The rock has evidently
been much cut away to facilitate the ascent, as we see from a glance
at the rocky terrace on the right, which has a precipitous face 6½ ft.
in height. Fragments of pedestals and square hollows in the rock
indicate the ancient sites of numerous votive offerings.</p>

<p class='c016'>The terrace of rock just mentioned, to which nine low steps ascend
farther on, once bore the temple of <i>Artemis Braurōnia</i>, but is now
strewn with beams and fragments of ceiling from the Propylæa (panels
with traces of blue colouring). The terrace is bounded on the W. by a
fragment of a broad wall belonging to the original Pelasgic fortifications
(p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>).—Another rock-terrace, about 2½ ft. higher, and also cut perpendicularly,
to the E. of the Brauronion, is supposed to have been the place
where, without any actual temple, <i>Athena</i> was worshipped as <i>Ergánē</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>the mistress and inventor of every art. To the S. of this terrace we
observe traces of walls which, together with the S. wall itself, seem to
have formed a gigantic building. It was perhaps the <i>Chalkotheka</i>, an
arsenal where not only implements of war but also bronze votive offerings,
and other objects were kept. Towards the Parthenon the terrace had nine
narrow steps on which votive offerings were deposited.</p>

<p class='c009'>About forty paces from the Propylæa, straight on, we come to
a large cutting in the rock, the supposed site of the bronze statue of
<i>Athena Promachos</i>, about 26 ft. high, by Phidias, erected with the
booty of Marathon. The goddess was represented in full armour,
with shield and lance. The gilded point of the lance, gleaming
in the sun, was a landmark for sailors rounding Cape Colonna.
The principal roadway, once used by the festal processions, passes
between the Erechtheion and the Parthenon to the E. front of the
latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Parthenon</b>, the most perfect monument of ancient art,
once far surpassing all other Athenian buildings in the brilliancy
of its plastic and polychrome decoration, and even in its ruins a
marvel of majestic beauty, stands on the highest S. margin of the
Acropolis precincts. On this site, as early as the middle of the
6th cent., a large temple was begun, adjoining the ancient Hekatompedon
(p. <a href='#Page_518'>518</a>), in poros or Piræan stone, and after the battle of
Marathon down to the Persian occupation was continued in marble.
In the time of Perikles, after 447, the whole edifice as it now stands
was rebuilt in Pentelic marble. The architects were <i>Iktinos</i> and
<i>Kallikrates</i>, but Perikles himself presided over the works and provided
the funds. The external sculptures are attributed to <i>Phidias</i>
and his pupils. The temple was probably opened for worship in 438,
on the occasion of the erection of the statue of Athena at the Panathenæan
Festival. This marvellous work must therefore have been
completed within ten years. Its decoration alone included 98 columns,
50 life-size statues for the pediments, a frieze 524 ft. long,
92 metopes, and a gold and ivory figure of Athena 43 ft. high.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the massive basement in three steps, whose <i>Stylobate</i>, or
platform for the colonnade, measures 75½ by 33 yds., rise 46
Doric columns averaging 34 ft. high, eight at each end and seventeen
on each side (the corner-columns being counted twice). On the
abaci of the columns rests the undivided <i>Architrave</i> or <i>Epistyle</i>,
above which runs a <i>Triglyph Frieze</i>, the most characteristic feature
of the Doric order. This consists of <i>triglyphs</i> or triple grooves,
alternating with <i>metopes</i> or flat spaces, which in this case are adorned
with reliefs. Above the frieze is the <i>geison</i>, or lowest flat moulding
of the cornice, while below each triglyph hang <i>regulae</i> (<i>guttae</i>,
or drops), corresponding with drops above it. The triglyphs and
drops were painted blue, the ground of the metopes blue or red,
and the lower surface of the geison and the continuous moulding
above the frieze and architrave red. The smooth spaces in front
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>were left white, as were also the columns, with the exception of
the four rings or annuli below the capitals.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gable-roof rose at an angle of 13½°. At each end is a pediment,
framing the <i>tympanum</i>, or receding space for statuary
91½ ft. long, 3 ft. deep, and in the centre 10½ ft. high. It was
painted red at the back, so as to throw the statues into strong relief.
The raised edges (<i>simae</i>) of the external members of the pediment,
18½ inches high, are intended to prevent the rain-water
from escaping over the front; they were adorned with wreaths of
foliage. The pediment was crowned with a boldly executed palmette,
and at each corner was placed a golden oil-jar.—The roof, resting
partly on timber and partly on stone framework, consisted of slabs
of Parian marble 1¼ in. thick; it was edged with artistic <i>antefixae</i>,
or hollowed tiles, between which the rain-water escaped.
The lions’ heads at the ends of each side were purely ornamental.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Cella</i>, or sanctuary proper, enclosed by the outer colonnades,
is raised two steps above the stylobate. At each end a portico
is formed by six Doric columns, 33 ft. high, and by the projecting
sides. Above the architrave, round the whole building ran a frieze,
of which hardly any traces remain except on the W. side (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_517'>517</a>).—The porticos were closed by high bronze railings between
the columns. From the E. portico massive folding doors led
into the interior, which was divided by a partition into an eastern
and a smaller western section. The former, the inner sanctuary,
was known as the <i>Hekatompedon</i>, being ‘100 ft. long’ (comp.
p. <a href='#Page_518'>518</a>). It was divided into three aisles by two rows of Doric columns
(9 in each). On a square of darker stone in the pavement
stood the famous gold and ivory statue of Athena Parthenos by
Phidias. The ceiling was of wood in lacunars, which were doubtless
richly coloured. Light was admitted by the door alone. The
walls were painted dark-red, but no adequate idea can now be
formed of the original wealth of colouring.—Between the partition
and the W. portico, which is supposed to have formed a kind of
treasury (<i>opisthodomos</i>), lay the W. section of the cella, 14 yds. in
depth, sometimes called the <i>Parthenon</i> in the narrower sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>The crowning glory of the Parthenon consisted in its plastic
decoration, executed under the direction of <i>Phidias</i>. Most of the
sculptures still preserved were taken to London by Lord Elgin in
1802–3 and are now in the British Museum, but there are several
others in the Acropolis Museum (see p. <a href='#Page_519'>519</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>E. Tympanum</i> was devoted to the nativity of Athena.
All that remains of its sculptures in their original position consists
of two horses’ heads belonging to the chariot of the rising Helios,
on the left, and remains of a horse’s head of the chariot of the
setting Selene, on the right. In the <i>W. Tympanum</i>, which illustrated
the victory of Athena over Poseidon in their contest for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>possession of Attica, are still seen, near the left angle, a half-recumbent
male figure, round whose neck is the arm of a kneeling
woman (Æsculapius and Hygieia?), and in the right angle a female
figure supposed to be Kallirrhoë (p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Metope Reliefs</i> are of inferior artistic value. Of the 92
there still exist the 28 at each end and 12 on the N. side. They represent
the conflicts of the gods with the Giants (E.), of the Lapithæ
and Athenians with the Centaurs (S.), of the Athenians with the
Amazons (W.), and lastly the siege of Troy. The high relief in
some cases assumes an almost entirely rounded form.</p>

<p class='c011'>The masterpiece of Attic bas-relief is the *<i>Frieze</i> of the cella
wall, 175 yds. long and 39 in. high. On the W. front the greater
part of it has been preserved, but on the S. side there are only
scanty fragments. Twenty-two slabs are now in the Acropolis Museum
(see p. <a href='#Page_519'>519</a>). The reliefs represented the festal procession in
which every four years, at the close of the Panathenæa, the maidens
of Athens presented the goddess with a magnificent woven robe.
Over the chief entrance is the presentation of the robe to Athena;
to the right and left of it are the assembled gods; on the sides and
at the back are Athenians. The figures were executed in low relief
of 2–2½ in. only, in order to prevent strong shadows being thrown
by the light entering the covered hall from below. The effect was
enhanced by painting and mountings in metal.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the hollows on the S. side of the Parthenon, far below, may
be traced the line of the <i>Pelasgic Wall</i> (p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>), which was covered
up when the terrace of the temple was formed. Excavations here,
and notably also to the N.W. of the Erechtheion, brought to light
a number of archaic statues and architectural fragments dating
from the Persian destruction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the N. margin of the Acropolis precincts, but in a slight
depression, rises the **<b>Eréchtheion</b>, the temple of the tutelary
goddess <i>Athena Poliás</i> and the other deities of the city. The
building was probably begun soon after the Peace of Nikias (421),
but only completed in 407 or after 400. It contained chambers for
the cult of Athena and Poseidon Erechtheus, while the vestibule
had an entrance to the salt-spring produced by Poseidon. But the
temple is now sadly ruined, having served in the middle ages as
a church and afterwards as a Turkish harem. Since 1902, however,
the ancient fragments have been pieced together, and they
now afford a fairly complete idea of the exterior of the building,
which differed from that of the ordinary temples.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nucleus of the edifice (24 by 12 yds.) rises on a threefold
basement in steps, and the sanctuary was entered by three porticos
(E., S., and N.) of charmingly varied type.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>E. Portico</i> was formed by six Ionic columns in front, the
northmost of which has been broken down. Their rich capitals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>bear the tripartite epistyle (p. <a href='#Page_515'>515</a>); above it are dark blocks of
stone to which the relief figures of the frieze were attached.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the E. portico and the Acropolis Wall twelve broad
steps, partly modern, descend to the terrace of rock, about 10 ft.
lower, on which stands the <i>N. Portico</i>. Its six columns display a
still greater wealth of sculpturing than those of the E. portico. The
ceiling is relieved by lacunars. The great main doorway is specially
rich and well preserved. The three holes in the rock below
the N. side of the N. colonnade were pointed out in ancient times
as the indentations made by Poseidon’s trident during his contest
with Athena for possession of Athens. Above them the pavement
and roof were left open.—The W. façade of the temple, in front
of which lay the <i>Pandroseion</i>, or shrine of Pandrosos, daughter of
Cecrops, was originally articulated by four columns, resting upon
a high parapet. The existing arrangement, of pilasters engaged in
a wall with windows, dates from the Roman period.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<i>Colonnade of the Caryatides</i> at the S.W. angle is particularly
charming. Instead of columns, six statues of virgins, over
life-size (7½ ft.), placed on a parapet, support the roof, the weight
of which they bear with ease and grace. The ancient Athenians
called them simply the <i>Korai</i> (maidens). The second figure from
the W. is a copy in terracotta; the one standing back in the E.
row has been restored.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the Erechtheion are the foundations (37½ by
14½ yds.) of the so-called <b>Hekatómpedon</b> (early 6th cent.), on
the site of the palace of Erechtheus. The name (‘100 ft. long’) is
evidenced by an inscription. Peisistratos and his sons embellished
it with a colonnade. After its destruction by the Persians it was
probably restored without the colonnade. Opinions differ as to its
object and as to its history after the completion of the Erechtheion.
It had a front (E.) chamber of three aisles and a narrow chamber
at the back (W.), with two small rooms between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the <i>Palace of Erechtheus</i>, the ancient residence of the
Attic kings, belonged the foundations to the E. of the Erechtheion.
So also did the poros (Piræan stone) bases of columns, lying opposite
the S.E. angle of the colonnade of the Caryatides, 5 ft. lower;
their extremely archaic form, with the shaft of the column embedded
in the base, points to the Mycenæan period.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to the Parthenon. To the E. of it once stood a
small round <i>Temple of the Goddess Roma and the Emp. Augustus</i>,
round the foundations of which lie fragments of its architrave.
Opposite the N.E. corner of the Parthenon are the remains of a
sacrificial altar of Athena.—At the S.E. angle of the precincts
the huge masonry of the <i>Kimonian Wall</i> (p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>) may be seen.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <b>Belvedere</b> at the N.E. angle of the Acropolis affords the best
survey of the city. To the S.E. are the columns of the Olympieion, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>the distant Hymettos; nearer rises Hadrian’s Arch; in the foreground is
the monument of Lysikrates; then the royal Palace and its gardens;
beyond them are Lykabettos and the gable-shaped Pentelikon; in the town,
a little to the left, shine the dazzling marble buildings of the Academy,
the University, and the Library; to the N. of these runs the Patisia road;
more to the left rises the lofty Metropolis Church, with the small Metropolis
nestling beside it; in the centre of the N. slope of the Acropolis rises
the Tower of the Winds; adjacent is the Bazaar with Hadrian’s Stoa;
to the W. is the Theseion, and beyond it the Kephisos Valley with its
olive-groves, and Mt. Parnes with its S. spur Mt. Ægaleos.</p>

<p class='c009'>The *<b>Acropolis Museum</b>, erected in 1878, contains all the
sculptures of the Acropolis, except those previously removed, and
the yield of later excavations. Besides works of the golden age, it
comprises valuable examples of the earlier periods of art. Adm.,
see p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the <span class='sc'>Vestibule</span>, containing antiques of various ages, we enter
(left) Room I, where the chronological order begins.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room I.</span> Archaic sculptures in poros (6th cent.). Straight before us,
No. 3. Bull attacked by two lions; above this, and by the right wall: 1, 2.
Tympana with statues of Hercules (with traces of painting). By the
window-wall: 9, 10. Deities enthroned, from a tympanum of the pre-Peisistrateian

<h4 class='c023'>c. Walk from the Palace to the Theseion. Dipylon. Hill of the Nymphs. Pnyx. Monument of Philopappos.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The upper or E. end of the <span class='sc'>Rue d’Hermès</span> (Pl. E-B, 5), which
leads to the W. from the Place de la Constitution, is one of the
chief business quarters of Athens. Among the wares sold in the
shops here are Oriental silks and woollen stuffs and antiquities,
the latter dear and sometimes spurious.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the S. of the Rue d’Hermès rises the <b>Metropolitan
Church</b> (Pl. E, 5), erected in 1840–55 with the materials of
seventy smaller churches and chapels, and sumptuously fitted up
in the interior. Adjoining it on the S. is the so-called *<b>Little
Metropolis</b>, or church of <i>Panagia Gorgópiko</i>, of the early
9th cent., the oldest extant Byzantine edifice on Greek soil. The
walls, composed of antique blocks of stone, contain many ancient
and Byzantine sculptures.</p>

<p class='c011'>Halfway along the Rue d’Hermès is the <span class='sc'>Kapnikaræa Church</span>
(Pl. D, 5), a complex Byzantine building (9th cent.?). Just beyond
it we cross the busy—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Rue d’Eole</span> (Pl. D, 6–3), the second main street of the old town,
where men in Greek costume are often seen. Following it to the
S., towards the Acropolis, and passing the Place Panteleēmon, we
come to the old <i>Bazaar</i> (Pl. D, 5), where tailors, shoemakers, and
smiths ply their crafts in their open workshops.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adjoining the bazaar on the S. is <b>Hadrian’s Library</b> (Pl. D, 5),
with its back to the Rue d’Eole, a massive edifice of 134 by 90 yds.</p>

<p class='c016'>A gate (keys at the provision-shop opposite) leads from the Rue d’Eole
into the quadrangle, once bordered with a colonnade. The columns still
standing and the building in the middle are restorations. On the wall of
the large hall on the E. side are seen the places where the bookshelves
were attached, as in the Pergamon library.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the W. side of the library, reached from the outside, still
stands the N. half of the main façade, known as <i>Hadrian’s Stoa</i>.
The marble wall is embellished with seven monolithic columns,
28 ft. high, with rich Corinthian capitals. An eighth column with
the wall of the <i>anta</i> belonged to the colonnade of the chief portal.—Near
this is the <i>Stoa of Attalos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_521'>521</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S. end of the Rue d’Eole rises the so-called <b>Tower of
the Winds</b> (Pl. D, 6; custodian 20–30 l.), a well-preserved octagonal
marble edifice of the 1st cent. B.C., more accurately named the
<i>Horológion of Andronikos</i> of Kyrrhos. On the upper spaces of
the eight walls, which are turned towards the different points of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>the compass, are reliefs representing the various winds; below are
seen the lines of sun-dials. The round channels in the pavement
inside, into which water flowed from a semicircular cistern outside,
belonged to a water-clock.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lanes and steps ascend here to the S. to a path skirting the N. slope
of the Acropolis and leading to the right to its entrance (10 min.; p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>A large paved quadrangle to the W. of the Tower of the Winds
is supposed to have been a <i>Roman Macellum</i> (Agora or market).
It is entered from the W. by the <b>Market Gate</b> (<i>Porte de l’Agora</i>;
Pl. C, 6). Four slender Doric columns, 26 ft. high, support a massive
architrave with a frieze of triglyphs and metopes and a fairly well
preserved pediment. According to the inscription on the architrave
the gateway was erected about the time of the birth of Christ.
In line with the N. central column is a tablet of Hadrian’s age,
inscribed with regulations about the prices of oil, salt, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Market Gate we follow the Poikile Street to the W.
to the Stoōn Street and descend the latter to the right. The second
crooked side-street on the right then leads to the entrance (red door
on the right; keeper 20 l.) of the <b>Stoa of Attalos</b> (Pl. C, 5, 6).
This grand, two-storied market-hall was erected, as the inscription
on the architrave, pieced together in front of the colonnade, records,
by king Attalos II. of Pergamon (B. C. 159–138). It was 123 yds.
long and 22 yds. deep, and formed the E. boundary of the Kerameikos
market (p. <a href='#Page_522'>522</a>). The groundfloor contained 21 closed
chambers 16 ft. deep, in front of which ran a long colonnade. The
traders probably had their stalls in the hall, while the closed rooms
were used for storage.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now descend to the N., across the railway cutting, to the Rue
d’Adrien, follow the latter to the left for a hundred paces, and turn
to the left (S.) into Eponymōn Street; here, on the left, sixty paces
farther, is the <i>Stoa of the Giants</i> (Pl. G.; C, 5), a ruin so named
from its three great Atlantes (beam-bearers).</p>

<p class='c011'>A little farther to the W., on the ancient <i>Kolonos Agoraeos</i>
(‘Hill of the Market’; see p. <a href='#Page_522'>522</a>), rises the **<b>Theseion</b> (Pl. B, 5),
the best-preserved of all the ancient Greek buildings. The massive
construction, the lifelike sculptures, and the dark golden hue of
the Pentelic marble are singularly impressive. The temple, commonly
called Theseion, and converted into the church of St. George
in the Christian period, is now supposed to have been dedicated to
<i>Hephaestos and Athena</i>. The style of the building and its sculptures
have led different authorities to assign its erection to a date
a little before or a little after that of the Parthenon. At all events
it was completed by 421 B. C., as an inscription records the setting
up in that year of the two sacred images.</p>

<p class='c011'>The temple stands on a marble basement in two steps, 35 by
15 yds., and is enclosed by 34 Doric columns, 18 ft. high, 6 at each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>end and 13 on each side (the corner-columns being counted twice).
They are rather more slender than those of the Parthenon, and like
them lean slightly inwards. Above the architrave, which is undivided,
runs a Doric frieze of triglyphs and metopes, encircling the
whole building. The metopes, however, are adorned with sculpture
only on the main (E.) façade and the immediately adjoining spaces
on each side. In front are depicted the exploits of Hercules, on the
sides those of Theseus. The building is crowned with a cornice
and pediments. The statuary of the tympana has disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nucleus of the temple consists of the cella, 13 yds. long,
at each end of which is a vestibule, formed by the antæ and two
columns between them, and opening on to the colonnade. The E.
vestibule now has a modern wall with a built-up door instead of
the columns. The coffered ceiling on this side has been preserved
intact. The W. vestibule retains its original aspect, except that a
door has been broken through the wall at the back. The upper
part of the cella wall is embellished, as in the Parthenon, with a
relief-frieze (in Parian marble), which here, however, is limited
to the two façades and the eastmost part of the sides. The E. part
of the frieze represents a battle (between the Athenians and the
Pelasgians?), witnessed by the gods. The W. frieze portrays the
struggle of the Lapithæ and Athenians against the Centaurs.—The
interior of the temple contains nothing of special interest.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many Englishmen were buried within this temple in the Turkish
period.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the E. and N. of the Theseion lay the <i>Kerameikos</i>, or potters’
quarter, to which, in the 6th cent., the <b>Market</b> was transferred
from the S.W. slope of the Acropolis. This, like the Forum
at Rome, was the centre of classical Athens.</p>

<p class='c016'>The market was adorned with statues of great poets and orators, such
as Pindar and Demosthenes. Around it rose the chief public buildings.
Among them were the <i>Stoa Basileios</i> (Pl. B, 5; seat of the Archon Basileus),
the foundations of which (6th cent.) are supposed to have been
discovered at No. 14 Poseidon Street.; also the Metroon, or temple of the
mother of the gods, the Buleuterion, or town-hall, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the N.W. of the Theseion a bridge crosses the Piræus
railway (p. <a href='#Page_495'>495</a>) to the <i>Theseion Station</i> (Pl. B, 5). To the W. of
this we reach the continuation of the Rue du Pirée. Following
the latter for 150 paces to the N.E. towards the town, and just
before reaching the conspicuous yellow and red chapel of <i>Hagia
Triáda</i> or <i>Trias</i> (Pl. A, 4), we come to a gate on the right leading
into the ancient cemetery at the Dipylon (small gratuity on leaving).
Here we follow an ancient side-street, bordered with tombs, as far
as the walls (see Pl. A, 4), which we skirt to the left. At their N.E.
end we reach the outer Dipylon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Dipylon</b> (Pl. B, 4), the only ancient ‘double gate’ of
Athens (end of 4th cent.), was the chief entrance of the city. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>converged the roads coming from Megara in the Peloponnesus and
Eleusis and from Platæa and Thebes in Bœotia; and from this gate
ran the <i>Dromos</i>, a great colonnaded street, to the S.E., below the
Theseion hill, to the Kerameikos market-place (p. <a href='#Page_522'>522</a>). The left
side of the gateway has wholly disappeared, but a few blocks,
attached to their base, of the right (S.) wall are still visible. In front
of these rises a considerable part of the S. gateway-tower. In the
centre are traces of the pier between the two passages. This outer
gateway was connected with an inner gateway, on precisely the
same plan, by walls 38 yds. long, thus forming an enclosed court.
The S.E. tower was adjoined on the E. by a well-house.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S.W. of the Dipylon the <i>City Wall</i>, here only 6½ ft.
thick, has been brought to light. The carefully jointed blocks of
blue limestone rest on the hastily built wall of Themistokles
(479–478); the upper part was built of sun-dried brick. Outside
this wall once rose a rampart, probably coeval with the Dipylon,
14 ft. thick, consisting of two walls with earth between. Beside
the city wall, five paces to the S.W. of the Dipylon, is an ancient
boundary-stone; seventy paces farther are remains of another gateway,
probably the <i>Funeral Gate</i>. This, like the Dipylon, consisted
of two gate-buildings, enclosing a court, though it had only
a single passage. Through it, by the roadside, flowed the little
brook <i>Eridanos</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the W. of the Dipylon, in the direction of the Hagia Triáda
Chapel, we soon reach the *<b>Burial Ground outside the
Dipylon</b>, the principal cemetery of ancient Athens. As at Rome
and Pompeii the tombs bordered the highroads outside the gates.
In this case the more durable monuments have been left by the excavators
in their original positions. Some of these are artistically
executed, others seem to have been merely rectangular walled spaces.
In ancient days, as now, the ground was very uneven; some of the
tombs close to the road were raised on terraces 5–8 ft. above it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before reaching the Hagia Triáda Chapel, we observe, on the left side
of the road, two stelæ on Doric substructures, the tombs of <i>Thersandros</i>
and <i>Simylos</i> (375 B. C.) and of <i>Pythagoras</i> (5th cent.). Ascending to the
left beyond a depression in the soil we come to a temple-shaped tomb,
with figures of <i>Demetria</i> and <i>Pamphile</i>, dating from the middle of the
4th century. Close to the Hagia Triáda Chapel is a large block of marble
resembling a sarcophagus, the <i>Tomb of Hipparete</i> (middle of the 4th cent.).—To
the left, on and beyond the stone wall of the side-street mentioned
at p. <a href='#Page_522'>522</a>, are rows of tombs, arranged in order of families and phylæ or
tribes and extending down to the Roman period. At the corner is that
of the family of <i>Lysanias</i>, with a *<i>Relief of Dexileos on horseback</i>, who
distinguished himself before Corinth in 394–393; the weapons and bridle were
added in bronze. Next come the tombs of the family of <i>Agathon</i> (4th cent.);
that of his wife <i>Korallion</i> represents a family group; then a temple-shaped
tomb, the interior of which was adorned with paintings now almost completely
erased. Farther on is a monument crowned with a huge bull.
In front of it is another little temple-like monument with traces of
painting; then a great Molossian hound. Beyond it, a tomb-relief with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>a boat.—Opposite the hound is the *<i>Tomb of Hegeso</i>, perhaps the finest
of all, a lady at her toilet attended by a maid (4th cent.). About twenty
paces short of the keeper’s house, and thirty paces to the S. of the path,
is a graceful <i>Hydrophoros</i> or female water-carrier (5–4th cent.).</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>The range of hills to the W. of the Acropolis and Areopagus,
now uninhabited, was a favourite residential quarter of the ancient
city, as is evidenced by countless remains of steps, cisterns, conduits,
walls, and streets. From the Theseion (223 ft.) we ascend
the broad <span class='sc'>Avenue of the Apostle Paul</span> (Pl. B, 6), where, immediately
on the right, rises the <i>Hagia Marina Hill</i>, thickly strewn
with relics of ancient dwellings. Above it rises the <i>Hill of the
Nymphs</i>, crowned with the <i>Observatory</i> (Pl. A, 6; 345 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the Observatory a road descends into a slight
hollow and then ascends the long <b>Pnyx Hill</b> (Pl. B, 7; 358 ft.),
the structure on the N.E. slope of which is distinctly visible from
the Areopagus and Acropolis. This consists of a terrace or platform,
131 yds. long and 71 yds. wide, the upper margin of which is
cut out of the rock, while the lower part is buttressed by a massive
wall of huge blocks of stone, forming a slightly flattened semicircle.
In front of the abrupt back-wall of the terrace, about 13 ft. high,
rise three steps bearing a cube of rock. This has been identified
with the <i>Pnyx</i>, the place where, before the tiers of stone benches
were erected in the theatre of Dionysos (p. <a href='#Page_510'>510</a>), the Athenians held
their political assemblies. The orator’s tribune (bēma) is supposed
to have been attached to sockets on the platform in front of the
cube of rock. The space occupied by the listening throng of citizens
sloped gradually up to the supporting wall, which at that
time was much higher. Above the cube once ran an upper terrace,
where there rose a similar rock-altar, now much damaged. From
this point we obtain a very striking view of the Acropolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the Pnyx Hill, in a depression, is the chapel of
<i>Hagios Demetrios Lumpardiáris</i> (Pl. B, 7), to the S. of which
we now ascend the Philopappos Hill, the ancient <i>Museion</i>. On its
crest we recognize many fragments of the ancient city-wall, which
was joined by the Long Walls (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>) on the heights near the
Monument and near the Observatory (see above).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Monument of Philopappos</b> (Pl. B, 8) was built in
114–16 A.D. The upper part, in Pentelic marble, two-thirds preserved,
had a frieze in high relief, crowned with three niches separated
by Corinthian half-columns. The statue seated in the central
niche is that of Antiochos Philopappos; to the left is that of his
grandfather Antiochos IV. Epiphanes (p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>). The relief is supposed
to represent the ceremonial progress of Philopappos in his
consular capacity. The square chamber behind was the burial-place.</p>

<p class='c016'>Very beautiful, especially at sunset, is the *<span class='sc'>View from the Philopappos
Hill</span>. The Acropolis is visible in its full extent; at its base
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>are the Odeion and the Theatre of Dionysos; to the right of these rise
Hadrian’s Arch and the hills of the Stadion and Hymettos. To the left of
the Acropolis are the Theseion and the Hill of the Nymphs, and beyond
them the Athenian plain, bounded by Ægaleos, and Parnes. Above the
Acropolis rise Mt. Lykabettos and part of Pentelikon. Towards the S.
stretches the Saronic Gulf.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>d. The Modern Quarters.</h4>

<p class='c021'>From the Place de la Constitution two broad streets lead to the
N.W. to the Place de la Concorde: the <span class='sc'>Rue du Stade</span> (Pl. F-D, 5–3)
and the Boul. de l’Université. In the former, immediately to the
right, are the <i>Royal Stables</i>; then on the left, standing a little
back, the <i>Parliament House</i> (Pl. E, 5).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the <span class='sc'>Boulevard de l’Université</span> the first house on the right
(Pl. S.; F, 5), is that of <i>Dr. Schliemann</i> (1822–90), the famous
discoverer of Troy, Mycenæ, and Tiryns. Farther on on the right
are also the <i>Roman Catholic Church</i> (Pl. F, 4) and the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Academy of Science</b> (Pl. F, 4), built of Pentelic marble
in 1859–84. The style is classic Grecian, with Ionic porticos, tympana
embellished with sculptures, and rich colouring, thus resembling
a classic edifice in its palmy days. The tympanum group of
the main building (birth of Athena) and the statues of Plato (left)
and Socrates (right), opposite the entrance, are by Drosos.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the vestibule a passage to the right, descending a few steps,
leads to the <i>Numismatic Museum</i> (adm., p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>), containing a valuable
collection of coins, chiefly from countries influenced by Grecian civilization.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adjacent is the <b>University</b> (Pl. F, 3, 4), founded in 1837. It
also has an Ionic portico and is enriched with colouring. The
organization is similar to that of the German universities. There
are about a hundred professors and lecturers and 2800 students.
The buildings contain also the natural history collections.</p>

<p class='c011'>The adjacent <b>Library</b> (Pl. E, 3; <i>National</i> and <i>University</i>,
united in 1903), a handsome edifice in Pentelic marble, contains
314,000 vols, and 2530 MSS.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rue du Stade and the Boulevard de l’Université cross the Rue
d’Eole (p. <a href='#Page_520'>520</a>) and its prolongation the Rue de Patisia (see below)
and end at the <span class='sc'>Place de la Concorde</span> (<i>Plateia tēs Omoneias</i>;
Pl. D, 2, 3; tramways, p. <a href='#Page_503'>503</a>), planted with trees and much frequented
in the evening. From its S. side runs the Rue d’Athéna
(Pl. D, 3–5) and from its S.W. angle the Rue du Pirée (Pl. D-A, 3, 4;
fine view of the sea in the evening). To the W. runs the Rue Constantin,
with the handsome new <i>Constantine Church</i> (Pl. C, 2) and
the new <i>National Theatre</i> opposite (p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>). At the end of it the
road to the Peloponnesus Station (p. <a href='#Page_502'>502</a>) bends round to the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the <span class='sc'>Rue de Patisia</span> (Pl. D, E, 2, 1), near the outskirts of the
town, on the right, are the Polytechnic and the <i>National Museum</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>The <b>Polytechnic Institute</b> (Pl. E, 1), built in 1858 of Pentelic
marble, consists of a two-storied central edifice in the Doric and
Ionic styles and two Doric wings. The upper floor of the main building
contains the <i>Historical and Ethnological Museum</i> (adm., see
p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>), a collection of memorials of the Greek war of independence,
costumes, etc.—Beyond the next side-street is the Museum.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>e. The National Archæological Museum.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The **<i>National Archaeological Museum</i> (Pl. E, 1), erected
in 1866–89, contains the collections of antiquities belonging to the
state (other than those of the Acropolis, Olympia, Delphi, etc.).
Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>. In the central rooms are exhibited the Mycenæan
and Egyptian antiquities, in the left (N.) wing the marble sculptures,
in the E. annex the bronzes, and in the S. wing the vases.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the Vestibule we go straight into the central building.</p>

<p class='c022'>*<span class='sc'>Room of the Mycenæan Antiquities</span> (about B.C. 1500–1000; comp.
p. <a href='#Page_416'>416</a>). The cases Nos. 1–41 in the middle contain the objects found in
the richly furnished royal tombs in the citadel of Mycenæ, the traditional
burial-place of Agamemnon and his family. They comprise trinkets,
bronze weapons, vessels and utensils of gold, silver, and clay, etc.; thus,
in stands 20 and 24 are golden masks used to cover the faces of the
dead bodies, in stand 27 a double-handled beaker with doves, like that of
Nestor described by Homer. The five reliefs on limestone slabs (Nos. 51–55),
in the centre of the side-walls, were found above the tombs. No. 50, a
case in the centre, shows the 6th tomb exactly as when discovered in 1878.</p>

<p class='c022'>The other cases contain relics of the same period from Mycenæ, and
also, of rather later date, from other places in Greece, where the tombs
were more plainly fitted up. At the end of the room, on columns: *1758,
*1759. Gold goblets from Vaphio (near Sparta), with lifelike embossed
scenes of browsing cattle and a bull-hunt. In the centre, in the detached
glass-case No. 4, are chased and inlaid *Daggers.</p>

<p class='c022'>Adjacent, straight on, is the <span class='sc'>Egyptian Room</span>.</p>

<p class='c022'>We return to the Vestibule and enter the N. wing, containing the
<b>Marble Sculptures</b>.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Room of Archaic Art</span> (7–6th cent.). To the left in the ante-room,
No. 1. <i>Female Statue</i> (votive offering of Nikandre, primitive), and Nos.

the next room, 11,761. <i>Statue of Poseidon</i> (early 5th cent.).</p>

<p class='c022'>III. <span class='sc'>Bronze Room</span> (rotunda) contains the other bronzes found in the
strait of Kythera (comp. R. I). To the right of the entrance, 13,399. Figure
of a youth, in the style of the older Argive school, still on its old pedestal;
13,397 and 13,398. Statuettes of youths; 13,400. Hellenistic head.</p>

<p class='c022'>We return to the Sarcophagus Room and pass to the left through
the <span class='sc'>Room of the Roman Tomb Reliefs</span> to the—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span><span class='sc'>Room of the Votive Reliefs.</span> By the entrance wall and on the
left are votive reliefs from the <i>Asklepieion</i> (p. <a href='#Page_511'>511</a>). The most elaborately
executed is No. 1377, near the middle of the left wall (4th cent.); adjacent
is No. 2565, in the form of a stele.—The <span class='sc'>Karapanos Room</span> is chiefly
devoted to relics from the Zeus oracle at Dodona.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the S. side of the museum is the <b>Collection of Vases</b>. The
finest are mostly from Attica, the chief seat of the vase-painting of the
6–4th cent., such as the <i>Black-figured Vases</i>, with their silhouette-like
figures painted in black (6th cent.; <span class='sc'>Room I</span>, cabinets 13–23); the <i>Red-figured
Vases</i>, vessels entirely covered with a black glaze, the figures
alone, on their original red ground, remaining free (after middle of 6th cent.;
<span class='sc'>Room II</span>); and the <i>Lekythi</i>, slender vessels for perfumes, with coloured
figures on a white ground (after the Persian wars; <span class='sc'>Room III</span>, cabinets 41–50).</p>

<p class='c022'>Adjacent are three front-rooms containing the <b>Terracottas</b>, including
fine sets of figurines of the best period (5–4th cent.). In the last
room are exhibited also antique trinkets and vessels.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>f. Walks.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The ascent of <b>Lykabettós</b> (909 ft.), the finely shaped hill to
the N.E. of Athens, is specially attractive by early morning or late
evening light. We diverge to the N. from the Rue de Képhisia at
the end of the palace-garden (Pl. G, 5), cross the Kolonáki Square
(Pl. G, H, 5), and in 6 min. reach the reservoir of the <i>Water Conduit</i>
of Hadrian, now utilized anew (Pl. H, 4; 445 ft.), where there is
a small café commanding a fine view. Hence we proceed to the
Lukianos Street, from the N. end of which an easy path ascends
through young plantations. After the first zigzags a level path
(Pl. H, 3) diverging to the left affords almost finer views than the
top of the hill. The path straight on ascends to the <i>Georgios Chapel</i>
(Pl. H, 3) on the summit in ½ hr. more.</p>

<p class='c016'>The view embraces the city of Athens, with the Acropolis and the
Attic plain, the Piræus, the bay of Phaleron, and the Saronic Gulf, with
Ægina and Salamis and the distant mountains of Argolis; to the right
of Salamis are the hills of Corinth and Megara; in the foreground, concealing
the bay of Eleusis, rises Mt. Ægaleos; farther to the N. is Mt.
Parnes. Between the latter and Pentelikon, which rises to the N.E.,
extends the upper plain of Attica. To the E. is Mt. Hymettos.</p>

<p class='c009'>A fine view of Athens and the Acropolis is obtained also from the
<b>Kolōnós</b> hill, the legendary home of Sophocles. From the Place
de la Concorde (Pl. D, 2, 3) we follow the tramway to <i>Kolokythu</i>
(comp. Pl. A, 1) and reach the hill in ½ hr.; it rises to the right
of the road and is recognized by the conspicuous monuments of the
antiquarians Otfried Müller (d. 1840) and Chas. Lenormant (d. 1859).
Adjacent lay the <span class='sc'>Akademeia</span>, the grove where Plato taught.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most popular resort on fine summer evenings is <b>New
Pháleron</b> (tramway and Piræus railway, see p. <a href='#Page_503'>503</a>), on the bay
of Phaleron. A band plays in the evening on the broad coast-terrace,
with its cafés and bath-houses (bath 40 l.).—A branch
of the tramway runs to the quieter sea-baths of <span class='sc'>Old Phaleron</span>

<p class='c009'><i>Athens</i> and the <i>Piraeus</i>, see pp. <a href='#Page_502'>502</a>, 494. We first steer to the
S.E. across the <i>Bay of Ægina</i> (p. <a href='#Page_494'>494</a>), past the three pinnacles
of <i>Cape Zostēr</i>, the southmost spur of Hymettos, and near the islets
of <i>Phleva</i> (ancient <i>Phabra</i>; lighthouse) and <i>Gaïdaronisi</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Cape Colonna</i> or <i>Kolonnaes</i> (ancient <i>Sunion</i>), on which
the columns of the temple of Poseidon are conspicuous, opens the
<i>Strait of Kea</i>, between (left and right) the lonely <i>Makronisi</i>
(922 ft.; ‘long island’; ancient <i>Helena</i>) and the fertile island of
<i>Kea</i> (1863 ft.; formerly <i>Keos</i>), with its lighthouse on the headland
of <i>Hagios Nikolaos</i>. On the left are the <i>Petali Islands</i>
(<i>Petaliae Insulae</i>) in the bay of that name, and <i>Hagios Elias</i>
(5264 ft.), the S. point of <i>Euboea</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next steer through the <i>Straits of Doro</i> (7½ M. in width;
Ital. <i>Canal d’Oro</i>), where a strong N.E. current prevails and storms
are frequently encountered. They lie between Eubœa and <i>Andros</i>
(3199 ft.; 156 sq. M.), the largest of the Cyclades (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>), with
the lighthouse on <i>Cape Fassa</i>. Beyond them we are in the open sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Halfway between Andros and Chios (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>) are the <i>Kalogeros
Cliffs</i>, belonging to Greece. Most of the vessels leave them to the
right and steer to the E.N.E. to the passage between the rocky island
of <i>Psara</i> (ancient <i>Psyra</i>; notable for the revolt of the modern
Greeks against the Turks) and <i>Chios</i>, with the bold and conspicuous
<i>Mt. Hagios Elias</i> (4134 ft.; <i>Pelinnaeon</i>) at its N. end. To the N.
appears the S. coast of <i>Mytilini</i> (p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>Beyond the N. end of the <i>Straits of Chios</i> (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>) the Levant
steamers (RR. 75, 76) round the steep limestone rocks of the Anatolian
peninsula of <i>Kara Burun</i>, with the <i>Boz Dagh</i> (3920 ft.;
ancient <i>Mimas</i>), and come in sight of the *<b>Gulf of Smyrna</b>, the
ancient <i>Sinus Hermaeus</i>, which runs 34 M. inland. The entrance
between (right and left) the headlands <i>Kinlu Burun</i> and <i>Arslan
Burun</i> (Greek <i>Cape Hydra</i>) is 15 M. broad.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the left, to the S. of Arslan Burun, near the islets of <i>Drepanon</i>
and <i>Oglak</i> (lighthouse), lies the little bay of <i>Phokia</i> (Turk.
<i>Foja</i>). This was the ancient <i>Phocaea</i>, the northmost Ionian town,
whose bold mariners first opened up the W. Mediterranean to the
Greeks (comp. p. <a href='#Page_121'>121</a>). Farther to the S., beyond <i>Cape Myrminghi</i>
(lighthouse), is the new estuary of the <i>Gedis Chai</i> (<i>Hermos</i>),
flanked with swampy alluvial soil and salt-works.</p>

<p class='c011'>After rounding the island of <i>Kiösteni</i> (Gr. <i>Makronisi</i>), which
lies in front of the E. slope of the Boz Dagh (see above) and masks
the <i>Bay of Gülbagcheh</i>, we sight to the S., beyond the <i>Marathusa
Islands</i>, the houses of <i>Hagios Joannes</i> (quarantine station), on an
islet in the <i>Bay of Vurlá</i>. Here once lay the Ionian town of <i>Klazomenae</i>.
The plain of Vurlá is famed for its wine and ‘Smyrna figs’.</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite the hills of the ‘<i>Two Brothers</i>’ (<i>Dyo Adelphia</i>,
Turk. <i>Iki Kardash</i>; 3252 ft.) we pass the narrow old channel of
the Gedis Chai (lighthouse). On a peninsula on the right lies the
Turkish <i>Fort Sanjak Kalesí</i>; farther on is the suburb of <i>Göz
Tepeh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_532'>532</a>). To the N.E. the imposing <i>Yamanlar Dagh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>)
and the lofty <i>Manissa Dagh</i> (5905 ft.; ancient <i>Sipylos</i>) beyond it
become more conspicuous. To the S. of the latter is a depression,
beyond which rises the <i>Takhtaly</i> or <i>Nif Dagh</i>. Beside the sea
rises the <i>Pagos</i> (p. <a href='#Page_532'>532</a>) with its old walls and many cypresses. On
its slopes, far to the S.W. and N.E., extends <i>Smyrna</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Smyrna</i>, Turk. <i>Izmir</i>, the seat of the vali or governor of the
Turkish province of <i>Aidin</i>, lies in 38° 26′ N. lat. and 27° 9′ E.
long., in a bay between Sanjak Kalesí (p. <a href='#Page_530'>530</a>) and the <i>Punta</i>
(La Pointe; Pl. D, E, 1). As all the older harbours on the W. coast
of Asia Minor have been choked by alluvial deposits, Smyrna has
developed into the chief seaport of Anatolia and the largest city
in Turkish Asia after Damascus. Population, excl. suburbs, about
200,000, incl. over 100,000 Greeks, 60,000 Turks, 20,000 Jews
(p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>), 12,000 Armenians, and 15,000 Europeans and Levantines.
The chief languages are Greek, French, and Italian.</p>

<p class='c016'>Smyrna was founded in the 11th cent. B.C. on the N. side of the
bay of Burnabad (p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>), about 2 M. to the N. of the present city. The
Ionians of Colophon (p. <a href='#Page_491'>491</a>) captured it for the sake of its trade in the
7th cent. and added it to their league of twelve cities. About 575 B.C. it
was taken by the Lydian king <i>Alyattes</i>, who destroyed it and settled its
inhabitants in villages. A new Smyrna, as planned by Alexander the Great,
was founded later on the Pagos (p. <a href='#Page_532'>532</a>) by the diadochi <i>Antigonos</i> and
<i>Lysimachos</i>, and soon developed into one of the finest towns in Asia
Minor. After the havoc wrought by terrible earthquakes in 178 and 180 A.D.
the emperor <i>Marcus Aurelius</i> caused it to be rebuilt. For a time it was
wrested from the Byzantine emperors by Turkish pirates (1084) and the
Seljuks (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>). During the Latin domination in Constantinople (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>)
Smyrna remained under the sceptre of the Greek emperor at Nikæa. In
1344 the Genoese and the Knights of St. John took the city under their
protection, but in 1402 they were unable to save it from the ravages committed
by Timur (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>), nor could they in 1424 prevent its capture by
the Osmans. This ‘eye of Asia Minor’, as the Turks have called Smyrna,
has risen to wonderful prosperity of late years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quays were built in 1868–80 and at the same time the <span class='sc'>Harbour</span>,
of 50 acres only, was protected by a breakwater 1400 yds.
long and 19 yds. in breadth. The entrance is between the N.E. end
of this breakwater and the N. pier (Pl. B, 3, 4) near the passport-office,
passengers’ custom-house, and telegraph office. The local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>steamers (p. <a href='#Page_531'>531</a>) are berthed between the N. and the S. mole (Pl.
A, 4, 5; chief custom-house).</p>

<p class='c011'>The great business thoroughfare is the <span class='sc'>Quay Street</span> (Greek
<i>Prokymaea</i>, Ital. <i>Marina</i>), over 2 M. long, skirting the Frank quarter
(see below). In the S. part of this street, among the motley
throng of sailors, dock-labourers, and traders of every nation, are
often seen picturesque trains of camels, headed in some cases by a
donkey. The N. part of the quay, with its theatres, cafés, and many
handsome dwelling-houses, is of an entirely different character.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the quay several alleys, the Kræmer Passage, the Hœnischer
Passage (Pl. B, 3, 4), and others, and the busy street Galatzo
Sokak (Pl. B, C, 3) lead to the <i>Frank Quarter</i>. The main streets
here, running parallel with the quay, are the so-called Parallel
St., the Quai Anglais (Turk. Eski Balik Basar; Pl. B, C, 3, 4),
the Maltese quarter, and above all the <span class='sc'>Franks’ Street</span>, in sections
bearing different names (Rue des Verreries, Rue Franque, Rue
Trassa, etc.), and lined with many European and other shops.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of Rue Franque, passing the Rom. Cath. cathedral of
<i>St. Jean</i> (Pl. C, 4), we come to the <i>Greek Quarter</i>, to which the
lively streets Bella Vista (Pl. D, 2) and Oroman Sokak (Pl. D, 2, 3)
also lead. The Greek Cath. cathedral of <i>Hagia Photinē</i> or <i>Aï
Fotini</i> (Pl. B, 4) lies near the S.W. end of the Franks’ Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little beyond Aï Fotini the street ends at the *<span class='sc'>Bazaar</span> (Pl.
B, 5; open till sunset), which vies in its picturesque variety with
the Great Bazaar of Constantinople. Smyrna carpets, mostly from
the interior, old embroidery, and modern silks may be bought here
at reasonable prices. The so-called antiquities, however, are generally
spurious. The bazaar is within the <i>Turkish Quarter</i>, on the
site of ancient Smyrna, with its quiet streets ascending the Pagos
(see below), and extending to the S.W. to the <i>Moslem</i> and the old
<i>Jewish Cemeteries</i>. Near these, but difficult to find, are traces of
the temples of <i>Asklepios</i> and <i>Vesta</i> (Pl. A, 7). Within the Turkish
quarter lies the very unsavoury <i>Jewish Quarter</i> (Pl. B, C, 5, 6).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the church of Aï Fotini we may walk through the <i>Armenian
Quarter</i>, past the Armenian cathedral of <i>St. Etienne</i> (Pl. C, 5)
and the Basma Khâné Station (Pl. D, 5), to the <i>Caravan Bridge</i>
(Pl. E, 5), which the busy traffic with the interior crosses.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Moslem cemeteries (Pl. A, B, 7) mentioned above, or
from the Caravan Bridge, we ascend in ½ hr. to the top of the
*<span class='sc'>Pagos</span> (525 ft.), which affords a superb view of the city, the bay,
and the hills around. The extensive outer wall of the old <i>Castle</i>,
dating from the Byzantine and Genoese periods, consists partly of
the substructures and masonry of the Acropolis of king Lysimachos
(p. <a href='#Page_531'>531</a>). Of the <i>Roman Theatre</i> (Pl. C, D, 6, 7) and the <i>Stadion</i>
(Pl. B, C, 7; p. <a href='#Page_509'>509</a>) on the hill-side hardly a trace is left.</p>

<p class='c016'>*<span class='sc'>Excursions.</span> To <i>Göz Tepeh</i> (p. <a href='#Page_530'>530</a>) by tramway or by local steamer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>(p. <a href='#Page_531'>531</a>).—By local steamer or by railway (from the Basma Khâné Stat.,
see p. <a href='#Page_532'>532</a>) to <i>Kordelio</i> (cafés; sea-baths), a little town prettily situated
among gardens on the N. bank of the bay. From the steamer, to the
E. of the Punta (p. <a href='#Page_531'>531</a>), we see the <i>Bay of Burnabad</i> and the plain of
that name, beyond which, on the <i>Yamanlar Dagh</i> (3202 ft.), is the site
of <i>Ancient Smyrna</i> (p. <a href='#Page_531'>531</a>).</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c011'>Leaving Smyrna the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> passes the Kara Burun (p. <a href='#Page_530'>530</a>)
and usually steers to the W.N.W. out to sea. Astern we obtain a
fine view of Chios. We soon skirt the beautiful S. coast of <b>Mytilini</b>
or <i>Mitylene</i> (3084 ft.; ancient <i>Lesbos</i>; 673 sq. M.), the largest
island in the Ægean Sea, and pass the narrow entrance of the
far-penetrating <i>Bay of Kalloni</i>. Beyond <i>Cape Sigri</i> (<i>Sigrium
Promontorium</i>) and the islet of <i>Megalonisi</i> (lighthouse) we sight
the distant coast of Troas (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the vessels, beyond Arslan Burun (p. <a href='#Page_530'>530</a>), steer to the
N., close to the Anatolian coast, and past the finely varied scenery,
of the <i>Bay of Chandarli</i>, the ancient <i>Sinus Elaeates</i>. On the
N. bank of that bay, to the W. of the estuary of the <i>Bakyr Chai</i>
(once <i>Kaïkos</i>), rises the <i>Kara Dagh</i> (2559 ft.; <i>Cane Mons</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Cape Maltepe</i>, a spur of Kara Dagh, and the <i>Hagios
Georgios Islands</i> opens the <i>Strait of Mytilini</i>, 9 M. wide, lying
between the island and the coast of ancient <i>Mysia</i>. On the right,
far inland from <i>Kabakum Bay</i>, we sight the hills near <i>Bergama</i>,
the famous <i>Pergamum</i> of the Greeks. On the hill-side to the left,
beyond <i>Cape Malea</i>, the S.E. point of the island, lies <i>Mytilini</i> or
<i>Kastro</i> (Turk. <i>Midüllü</i>), its capital, with a Genoese castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N. end of the strait, beyond the entrance to the harbour
of <i>Aivaly</i> (Gr. <i>Kydonia</i>), and the <i>Moshonisia Islands</i> (<i>Hekatonesoi</i>),
opens to the N.E. the broad <i>Bay of Edremid</i> (<i>Adramyti</i>),
on which rises <i>Kaz Dagh</i> (5807 ft.), the ancient <i>Ida</i>. We next
steer to the W. through the <i>Muselim Sound</i>, between the N. coast
of Mytilini and the S. coast of <i>Troas</i> or the <i>Troad</i>, where once
rose the loftily situated stronghold of <i>Assos</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>After passing cape <i>Baba Burnu</i> (<i>Lectum Promontorium</i>),
the S.W. point of Troas, we follow the course of the direct steamers
from Smyrna, past <i>Cape Eski Stambul</i> (‘Old Stambul’), the site
of <i>Alexandreia Troas</i>, a town of the Diadochi, and through the
<i>Strait of Tenedos</i> (3 M. broad). The island of <i>Tenedos</i>, famed in
the Trojan wars, now abounding in windmills, rises in a trachytic
double peak to a height of 627 ft.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N. end of the strait lies the islet of <i>Gaïdaronisi</i> (lighthouse).
Far away to the W., in clear weather, we descry the island
of <i>Limnos</i> (ancient <i>Lemnos</i>); to the N.W., beyond <i>Imbros</i>, towers
the mountain-mass of <i>Samothrake</i> (5250 ft.).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Besika Bay</i>, in front of which lie the volcanic islands
of <i>Tavshan Adalar</i> (‘rabbit-islands’; once <i>Kalydnae</i> or <i>Lagussae</i>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>we pass the hills bordering the W. side of the plain of <i>Troy</i>, the
legendary scene of the Homeric battles. Between <i>Hagios Dimitrios
Tepeh</i> (hill of St. Demetrius) and the Greek village of <i>Yenishehr</i>
is the site of <i>Sigeum</i> or <i>Sigeion</i>. Near it the tumuli of ‘Achilles
and Patroklos’ were the burial-places of that Athenian colony.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now near the strongly fortified <b>Dardanelles</b> (p. xxxiv), the
ancient <i>Hellespont</i>, now named after the ancient town of Dardanos
(see below). The straits connect the Ægean Sea with the Sea of
Marmora, a distance of 37½ M., and average ¾–4¾ M. in breadth,
and 160–295 ft. in depth. They intersect a tableland, 820–925 ft.
in height, of tertiary formation (yellow marl and marl-limestone
of the upper miocene). The surface current (p. <a href='#Page_557'>557</a>), sometimes
setting as in the Bosporus at the rate of 5 M. an hour, causes serious
difficulty to sailing-vessels, especially if wind and tide are both
against them.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S.W. entrance to the Dardanelles, scarcely 2½ M. broad,
lies a village on the Asiatic side with the ruined fortress of <i>Kum
Kaleh</i> (light); opposite, on the <i>Peninsula of Gallipoli</i>, the ancient
<i>Thracian Chersonesus</i>, is the fort of <i>Sidd el-Bahr Kalesí</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Kum Kaleh we sight to the S., rising above the marshy
plain of the <i>Mendere Chai</i> (<i>Skamander</i>), the low hill which was
once the site of <i>Troy</i> (near <i>Hissarlik</i>), with the débris of the excavations.
On the shore, to the W. of the mouth of the stream, lay
the landing-place of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing the site of <i>Dardanos</i> (on the right) we soon reach the
narrowest part of the straits (about 1475 yds.), commanded by the
<i>Dardanelles Castles</i> built by Mohammed II. in 1470, with their
new earthworks. On the European side is the picturesque <i>Kilid
Bahr</i> (‘key of the sea’); on the Asiatic side is <i>Kaleh Sultanieh</i>
or <i>Boghaz Hissar</i>, at the mouth of the <i>Koja Chai</i> (<i>Rhodios</i>).
Under the protection of the latter lies the town of <i>Chanak Kalesí</i>
(‘castle of pots’), usually called <b>Dardanelles</b> (pop. 16,700). While
the steamer stops for way-leave the potters of the place offer their
curiously shaped and painted vases for sale.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the second-narrowest part of the straits (1585 yds.), where
they bend to the N.E., once lay the towns of <i>Sestos</i> (left) and <i>Abydos</i>
(right), now fort <i>Nagara Kalesí</i> (quarantine station; lighthouse).
This was the traditional scene of the romance of Hero and
Leander; it was here that Lord Byron swam across in 1810.
Xerxes crossed the straits here in 480 B.C., Alexander the Great
in 334 B.C., and the Turks in 1357.—On the coast, to the left, is
the small plain of <i>Ægospotamoi</i> (now <i>Karakova Dereh</i>), off which
the Spartans won a decisive victory over the Athenians in 405.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the N.E. end of the Dardanelles, on the right, lies the village
of <i>Lampsaki</i> (<i>Lampsakos</i>) amid olive-groves and vineyards.
To the left, on the steep projecting coast, is superbly situated the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>decayed town of <i>Gallipoli</i> (<i>Kallipolis</i>, ‘beautiful town’), the first
European town captured in 1357 by Suleiman, son of Orkhân (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The Dardanelles expand into the <b>Sea of Marmora</b> (p. xxxiv),
the ancient <i>Propontis</i>, a basin of comparatively recent origin (extreme
depth 4450 ft.), which like the Ægean Sea has been formed
by the subsidence of large portions of the earth’s surface. On the
Asiatic side, beyond <i>Kara Burun</i> (381 ft.), lies the <i>Bay of Artaki</i>,
on the N. margin of the ancient Troas. Adjoining the bay is the
plain of the <i>Biga Sher Chai</i>, the ancient <i>Granikos</i>, where in 334
Alexander the Great won his first victory over the Persians.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the coast of ancient <i>Phrygia</i> rises the peninsula of <i>Kapu
Dagh</i> (2625 ft.; once <i>Arktonnesos</i> island), flanked by the <i>Pasha
Liman</i> islands and <i>Marmora</i> or <i>Marmara</i> (2326 ft.), where white
marble for Constantinople has been quarried since ancient times.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. coast soon appear the villages of <i>Sharkiöi</i> (once
<i>Peristasis</i>) and <i>Hiraklitsa</i> (<i>Heraklea</i>); then the town of <i>Rodosto</i>
(Turk. <i>Tekirdagh</i>), and farther on, <i>Eregli</i>, the ancient <i>Perinthos</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. we sight the islet of <i>Kalolimni</i> (689 ft.; <i>Besbikos</i>);
far beyond it are the <i>Gulf of Mudania</i> (or <i>Gemlek</i>) and the town
of <i>Brussa</i>, at the foot of the Bithynian <i>Olympos</i> (8200 ft.), which
is generally capped with snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off the beautiful <i>Gulf of Ismid</i> (<i>Nikomedeia</i>), to the N.E., lie
the <b>Princes Islands</b> (<i>Iles des Princes</i>; comp. Map, p. <a href='#Page_557'>557</a>), the
ancient <i>Demonnesoi</i> (Turk. <i>Kizil Adalar</i>, ‘red islands’, so called
from the colour of their ferruginous rocks).</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Prinkipo</b>, the ancient <i>Pityusa</i> (‘rich in pines’), the largest and
most populous of these islands, attracts many excursionists from Constantinople
in fine weather (local steamers, see p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>). On the N. side
of the island lies its capital, <i>Prinkipo</i> (Hôt. Giacomo, déj. 5, D. 6 fr.; Hôt.
Impérial, and others). Pleasant drive thence (2½ hrs. there and back;
1–2 mejidiehs; or ride, ½–1 mej.) to the highest hill on the S. side of
the island, crowned with the old <i>Monastery of St. George</i> (656 ft.; *View).</p>

<p class='c022'>On its way from Constantinople to Prinkipo the steamer first touches
at <i>Proti</i> (377 ft.). To the right we see the small island of <i>Oxia</i>, the
most westerly of the group, to which in 1910 the famous street-dogs of
Constantinople were transported, and <i>Plati</i> (‘the flat’), also called ‘Bulwer’s
Island’ after an English Ambassador who here built two now ruined
castles (19th cent.) in the style of Windsor. The steamer calls also at
<i>Antigoni</i> (542 ft.), and <i>Chalki</i> (446 ft.; ‘ore-island’), with a Greek commercial
school and a seminary for priests.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the flat European shore, beyond the village of <i>Küchük
Chekmekjeh</i> on the lagoon of that name, we sight the Russian war-monument
with its gleaming tower, a landmark of Constantinople,
rising above the cape of <i>San Stefano</i> (lighthouse). A little later
appears <i>Stambul</i>. Next, beyond the lighthouse (Phare), is seen the
white mosque of Ahmed and the yellow Aya Sophia.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Asiatic coast, on the promontory which runs out into the
beautiful <i>Bay of Moda</i>, there is situated, in the ancient <i>Bithynia</i>,
<i>Fanar Burnu</i> or <i>Fener Bagcheh</i> (lighthouse). Beyond, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span><i>Kadikiöi</i> (Kadi Keuï), a modern suburb of Constantinople, on the
site of <i>Kalchedon</i> or <i>Chalcedon</i>. Farther on are the little harbour
of <i>Haidar Pasha</i> (p. <a href='#Page_557'>557</a>), the station of the Anatolian railway,
and, at the S. end of <i>Scutari</i> (p. <a href='#Page_556'>556</a>), the military school of
medicine, the large Selimieh Barracks, and the Selimieh Mosque.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer now rounds the Seraglio Point and enters the
<i>Bosporus</i> (p. <a href='#Page_557'>557</a>); it passes the Golden Horn, the harbour of
Constantinople, and the New Bridge, and casts anchor at the
Galata Quay below Pera. Landing, see below.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Direct Steamers</span> from Athens to Constantinople steer from the
<i>Straits of Doro</i> (p. <a href='#Page_529'>529</a>) to the N.N.E. for Tenedos (p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>). In clear
weather we descry to the right the distant <i>Chios</i> (p. <a href='#Page_492'>492</a>) and <i>Psara</i> (p. <a href='#Page_529'>529</a>),
and to the left <i>Skyros</i> (2608 ft.), the S.E. island of the <i>N. Sporades</i>. On
the right we next sight <i>Mytilini</i> (p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>), and on the left <i>Hagiostrati</i>
(971 ft.; <i>Halonnesos</i>). From <i>Tenedos</i> to <i>Constantinople</i>, see p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Arrival by Sea.</span> The French, German, and Rumanian (RR. 76, 82)
steamers are berthed at the Galata Quay (Pl. H, I, 4), near the Dogana
or Douane. Passengers of the French and German steamers have to pay
pier-dues (1st class 5½, 2nd cl. 3½ s. pias). The Austrian, Italian, and
Egyptian steamers also, on their arrival from the Black Sea, are mostly
moored at the quay, but when coming from the S. they usually anchor
in front of it, at the entrance of the Golden Horn (landing or embarkation,
with baggage, 2 fr. or 10 pias.). The porters (hamáls, mostly Kurds) of
the Harbour Co. receive 5 pias. and a gratuity of 1 pias. for conveying
baggage from the quay to the hotels. All trouble with boatmen and porters
is avoided by applying at once to the guides (dragomans) or hotel-agents.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>In the following description the transcripts ö and ü have approximately
the German value, or the French of eu and u respectively.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Money.</b> The <i>Turkish Pound</i> (<i>lira</i>), worth about 23 fr. or 18<i>s.</i>
5<i>d.</i>, is divided into 100 piastres. There are gold coins of ¼, ½, 1, 2½,
and 5 pounds. The commonest coins are <i>Silver Piastres</i> (s. pias.; coins
of 5, 10, and 20 s. pias.), but at the government, railway, and steamboat
offices, in the tobacco-shops, and on the tramways they suffer a slight
loss (5 s. pias. = 4¾, 10 s. pias. = 9½, 20 s. pias. = 19 piastres in gold). The
piastre (worth 2⅒<i>d.</i>) is called <i>Gurúsh</i> in Turkish (<i>grosi</i> in Greek), the
five-piastre piece is a <i>Cheïrek</i> (or simply ‘franc’), the twenty-piastre
piece (about 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) is a <i>Mejidieh</i>. A piastre is divided into 40 parts called
<i>Paras</i>; the commonest para-coins are the thinly silvered bronze <i>Metalliks</i>
of 10 paras (about ½<i>d.</i>); there are others of 5, 20, 50, and 100 paras. New
nickel coins of 1 pias., 20, 10, and 5 paras will in 1912 be brought into
circulation.</p>

<p class='c011'>A French or Greek silver franc passes in ordinary traffic for 4½ s.
pias., and the Napoleon (the most popular of foreign coins) for 95 s. pias.
(but the money-changers usually give 93 s. pias. only). The average exchange
for an English sovereign is 120 s. pias.; for bank and circular
notes the exchange is rather higher. French banknotes can be exchanged
only at the banks. Small change, of which there is always a scarcity,
is obtained at the banks (p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>) or at the money-changers, the current
rate of exchange being ascertained beforehand. Worn-out coins may be
exchanged at the Banque Ottomane.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accounts are still kept in the provinces in ‘bad (<i>chürük</i>) piastres’; of
these there are silver coins worth 1¼, 2½, and 5 pias., and copper coins of
1¼ and 2½ pias.—The Turkish pound contains 178 bad piastres, the
mejidieh 33, and the silver piastre 1⅔. A pound sterling is therefore
worth about 209 bad piastres, a shilling about 10½, and a franc 8⅓.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Turkish Numbers</b>: 1, bir; 2, ikí; 3, ütsh; 4, dört; 5, besh; 6,
altí; 7, yedí; 8, sekíz; 9, dokuz; 10, on; 11, on bir; 20, yirmí; 25, yirmí
besh; 30, otuz; 40, kirk; 50, elí; 100, yüz; 1000, bin. ‘Katsh pará’, how
many paras? ‘Besh gurúsh’, five piastres.</p>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Baggage and passports (p. xvii) are examined in the ‘Salon’ or Bureau
des Passeports. The importation of weapons and ammunition and of
tobacco and cigarettes is prohibited. Cigars, however, if declared, are
admitted at an ad valorem duty of 75 per cent. On showing their passports
passengers must state where they intend to reside; the passports are
then stamped and returned to them. On leaving the country passports
are again examined (<i>visés</i> by consul, p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>); so also is luggage, to prevent
exportation of antiquities.</p>

<p class='c022'>On leaving the Salon each passenger has to pay the Harbour Co.
5 pias. in gold, also 1 pias. for each trunk and ½ pias. for each piece of
hand-luggage.</p>

<p class='c022'>The <b>Station</b> (Pl. H, 5; Buffet, on the side for departure; Rail. Restaurant
opposite) of the Oriental Railway is at Stambul, 7 min. to the S.E. of
the New Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>).—The clock, which gives E. European time, is
an hour in advance of mid-European time. As the officials understand
French, the services of the hotel-agents may be dispensed with.—Small
articles of luggage are examined at the frontier-station Mustapha Pasha,
registered luggage in the hall of arrival, and passports at the exit.—<i>Porter</i>
to hotel 11 pias.—<i>Cab</i> from station to hotel 20–25 pias., incl. bridge-toll
of 2½ pias. (from quay to hotel 10 pias.; tariff, see p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Constantinople</i>, Turk. <i>Stambul</i> or <i>Stamboul</i>, Ital. <i>Costantinopoli</i>,
Slav. <i>Tsarigrad</i> (emperor’s town), capital of the Turkish
empire and residence of the Sultan (since 1909 Mohammed V., b.
1844; successor of Abdul Hamid, p. <a href='#Page_544'>544</a>), is the seat of the government
(the ‘Sublime Porte’), and also of the Sheikh ul-Islam, of
the patriarchs of the Greek and Armenian churches, and of a papal
legate. It lies on the Sea of Marmora, at the mouth of the Bosporus,
in 41° N. lat. and 28° 58′ E. longitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>City</span> consists of several distinct quarters. <i>Stambul</i>, in
the narrower sense, forms a nearly equilateral triangle between the
Golden Horn (p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>) and the Sea of Marmora; to the N.E., on the
slopes of the opposite bank of the Golden Horn and on the adjacent
shore of the Bosporus, lie the Frank quarters of <i>Galata</i> and
<i>Pera</i> and their suburbs; and to the E., on the gently sloping Asiatic
shore of the Bosporus, lies the Turkish town of <i>Scutari</i> with
its suburbs. According to recent estimates Constantinople contains
1,125,000 inhab. (or, without the Asiatic quarters, 943,000),
incl. about 500,000 Turks, more than 200,000 Greeks, 180,000 Armenians,
65,000 Jews, mostly Spanish (see p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>), and 70,000
Europeans. The foreign residents are said to number 130,000.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Situation</span> of Constantinople has justly won the admiration
of all ages. The vast city of Stambul curving over the slopes between
the Sea of Marmora and the Golden Horn, the suburbs on
the Bosporus, its green banks studded with villages, palaces, and
mosques, the Golden Horn with its busy bridges and its countless
vessels, all combine to form a picture of matchless beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Climate</span> of Constantinople, which lies in the same latitude
as Naples (p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), is unsettled and comparatively cool. During
the greater part of the year the city is exposed to N.E. winds from
the Siberian steppes, which sweep through the Bosporus and in winter
occasionally bring snow. The best season for a visit is autumn (end
of Sept. to beginning of Nov.). The summer, however, is usually
fine and not unbearably hot, the coolest places being those on the
Bosporus, a little to the N., which are sheltered from the due S.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>winds (as Therapia, Büyükdereh, etc.). The mean temperature of
the year is 57½° Fahr., that of the hottest month (Aug.) 74°, and
that of the coldest (Feb.) 41°. The rainfall averages 28¾ in.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>History.</span> Attracted by the striking advantages of the site, at the
junction of two great portions of the globe and on the great water highway
between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, the Dorians founded the
colony of <b>Byzantium</b>, about 660 B.C., on the promontory (Seraglio Point, p.
<a href='#Page_536'>536</a>) commanding the entrance to the Bosporus. This colony, however,
like the towns on the coast of Asia Minor, was unable to withstand the
attacks of the Persians; when <i>Darius I.</i> crossed the Bosporus in his campaign
against the Scythians the Byzantines were compelled to supply
him with ships; and their town was afterwards destroyed by the Persians
for taking part in the Ionian revolt. The long but somewhat weak alliance
of Byzantium with Athens was succeeded by closer bonds when the
town was threatened by <i>Philip of Macedonia</i>. Being hard pressed by
<i>Phokion</i> Philip was compelled to raise the siege of the town (340–339).
Under <i>Alexander the Great</i> and his successors Byzantium maintained its
autonomy, but in 278 it suffered seriously from an attack by the Gauls
(‘Galatians’) settled in Thrace.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the wars against <i>Philip III. of Macedonia</i> Byzantium became
the natural ally of Rome, and this alliance continued to subsist under
the earlier Roman emperors. In 193–6 <i>Septimius Severus</i> besieged the
town to punish it for siding with the rival emperor Pescennius Niger,
and deprived it of its liberties and privileges; but he afterwards rebuilt
the walls, regarding it as an important bulwark of the empire. In 269
<i>Emp. Claudius II.</i> here repelled the attacks of the <i>Goths</i> when they attempted
to force their way south from the Danube.</p>

<p class='c022'>Having become master of the whole empire by the capture of Byzantium
in 324 <i>Emp. Constantine</i> chose it as his new capital on account
of its admirable situation on the threshold of the East. In 330 it was
officially styled New Rome, but soon became generally known as <b>Constantinopolis</b>.
Enclosed by Constantine’s new walls it now extended
to the W. to the region of the present Old Bridge (Pl. F, 4) and of
Psamatia (Pl. B, C, 8). The Romans retained the old division of the city
into fourteen regions, and they even found in it their seven hills again.
The environs as far as the 7th milestone (hebdomon), called the exokionion,
were assigned to the seven milliarii of the Gothic body-guard. Under
<i>Arcadius</i>, in 395, Constantinople became the capital of the new E. Roman
empire. The rapid increase of the population and the necessity of defending
it against the attacks of the <i>Huns</i> and <i>Goths</i> induced <i>Anthemius</i>,
regent during the minority of <i>Theodosius II.</i> (408–50), to build the new
Theodosian town-walls, ½–1¼ M. to the W. of those of Constantine. In
439 sea-walls along the Sea of Marmora and the Golden Horn were added,
and after 447, in consequence of an attack by Attila and to repair the damage
done by an earthquake, the land-walls were restored and strengthened.</p>

<p class='c022'>Byzantium attained the zenith of its prosperity under <i>Justinian</i>
(527–65). He rebuilt the city, after its almost entire destruction in 532
during the rebellion of the circus parties (Nika revolt), in a far grander
style, and on the site of Constantine’s basilica founded the famous church
of St. Sophia. In the form of Byzantine civilization antique culture
survived until the middle ages, although finally in a merely torpid state.
This Byzantine development, with its Greek language and independent
Oriental church under the patriarchal government at Constantinople, was
an outcome of the late Greek (‘Hellenistic’) and Roman culture.</p>

<p class='c022'>After the time of Justinian the empire was shaken to its foundations
by intestine disorders and foreign wars. The attacks of the <i>Avars</i> and
<i>Persians</i> (627) were succeeded by the irruption of the <i>Arabs</i> under the
Omaiyades (p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>), who in 673–8 and 717–8 besieged Constantinople by
sea and by land. About the same time the <i>Bulgarians</i> founded an independent
kingdom in the Balkan peninsula, and they too (in 813 and 924)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>attacked the city. Russian fleets forced their way into the Sea of Marmora
in 860 and 1048. Economically, too, Constantinople was on the
wane; from the 11th cent. onwards the <i>Seljuks</i> were gaining ground in
Asia Minor, and the Italian maritime cities were rapidly acquiring wealth
and power.</p>

<p class='c022'>The quarrels of aspirants to the throne during the Angelos dynasty
led in 1204 to the capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders and to the
foundation of a new western or ‘Latin’ empire. In 1261 the Greek emperor
<i>Michael Palaeologos</i>, who resided at Nikæa, succeeded in driving
the Franks out of Constantinople with the aid of the Genoese, to whom
he presented Galata (see below) as a reward. But the Turkish peril came
ever nearer. The <i>Osmans</i>, having conquered Asia Minor in the 13th cent.,
crossed the Dardanelles (comp. p. <a href='#Page_534'>534</a>) under <i>Orkhân</i> in 1357, and under
<i>Murad I.</i>, in 1361, made Adrianople the residence of the sultans instead
of Brussa. They were weakened for a time by the attacks of Timur
(p. <a href='#Page_485'>485</a>), but in 1411 and 1422 they proceeded to besiege Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c022'>After a heroic defence by <i>Constantine XI. Palaeologos</i>, the last Greek
emperor, the city was at length captured in 1453 by <i>Mohammed II.</i>
(Mehemed el-Fatih, ‘the conqueror’), and under the name of <b>Stambul</b>
became the capital of the Osmans. Its fortunes were now at their lowest
ebb; it was almost entirely depopulated and reduced to ruins, as had
been its fate when captured by the Crusaders in 1204. But soon Turkish
settlers from all quarters thronged to the new capital, and many Christians
also, their lives and religion being safeguarded, while numerous Jews
banished from Spain in 1492 found a new home here and have retained
their old language and characteristics ever since. The building enterprise
of the Turkish sultans, especially of <i>Selim I.</i> (1512–20), the conqueror of
Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, and of <i>Suleiman the Great</i> (1520–66), as
well as of the Turkish magnates, was directed exclusively to public
edifices. They erected mosques (p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>) on the model of the earlier church
of the Apostles and of the Aya Sophia (or church of St. Sophia), tomb-chapels
(p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>), bazaars and warehouses (<i>han</i>), and baths and fountains
(<i>sebil</i>, with running water; <i>cheshmeh</i>, draw-well). In the midst of these
sumptuous buildings lay a labyrinth of crooked streets and lanes, the
brightly painted timber houses with their grated balconies (kafehs) being
often of one story only, while here and there this strange sea of houses
was relieved by gardens and burial-grounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>To some extent, notwithstanding destructive fires (as in 1865 and
1908) and earthquakes (the last in 1894), the old Oriental characteristics
of the city still survive in the old town of <i>Stambul</i>, the chief seat of
the Oriental merchants and the petty traders, and also at Scutari (p. <a href='#Page_556'>556</a>).
<i>Galata</i>, on the other hand, the centre of the European trade, is much
like an Italian seaport-town. Above it, to the N., lies <i>Pera</i>, a suburb
which sprang up in the 19th cent., and which, since a great fire in 1870,
has been almost entirely rebuilt in quite European fashion.</p>

<p class='c022'>Of <span class='sc'>Books</span> on Constantinople may be mentioned: <i>Grosvenor</i>, Constantinople
(2 vols., London, 1895); <i>W. H. Hutton</i>, Constantinople in the
‘Mediæval Towns Series’ (London, 1900); and <i>Van Millingen</i>, Byzantine
Constantinople, The Walls, etc. (London, 1899).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>a. Galata and Pera.</h4>

<p class='c021'><b>Galata</b>, the oldest suburb of Constantinople, rises on the slope
of a plateau on the N. side of the entrance to the Golden Horn
(p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>), corresponding with the 13th region of the city of Constantine
(p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>). In the middle ages it was usually called <i>Peira</i>.
Its inhabitants are chiefly Greeks and Armenians. In 1304 the
Genoese (see above) enclosed it with a wall, and down to 1453 held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>an almost independent position under their own rulers (podestà).
The wall was often rebuilt and was at last removed (1864).</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind the <span class='sc'>Galata Quay</span> (Pl. H, I, 4), constructed in 1879–95,
lies a labyrinth of narrow and dirty streets, extending to the other
side of the <span class='sc'>Grand Rue de Galata</span> (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>), the chief thoroughfare
to the N.E. suburbs. At the S.W. end of the latter are the still
busier <span class='sc'>Rue de Karakeuï</span> (Pl. H, 4), beside the New Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>),
and the Place Karakeuï. where the <i>Exchange</i> rises on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the old-fashioned W. quarter of Galata are the ruinous
<i>Palace of the Podestà</i> (in the Pershembeh Bazaar, Pl. H, 4) and
the <i>Arab Jami</i> (Pl. G, 4), the oldest mosque in the city, which was
founded at the time of the Arab attacks (717). Near it is the <i>Yanik
Kapu</i>, an old Genoese gateway. A little farther on, near the Old
Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>), is the <i>Asab Kapu Jami</i> (Pl. G, 3, 4), erected by
Sinán (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>), adjoining which is a beautiful *<i>Sebíl</i> (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>), with
gilded railings and far projecting timber roof (18th cent.).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Old Bridge Pera is reached by the broad Rue Iskander
(Pl. G, 3), and from the New Bridge by the steep and dirty
<span class='sc'>Yüksek Kaldirim</span> (Pl. H, 3, 4), partly in steps (and also by the
tunnel or by tramway No. 1; p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the boundary between Galata and Pera, a little to the W.
of the N. end of the Yüksek Kaldirim, rises the <b>Galata Tower</b>
(Pl. H, 3; 148 ft. high), now entirely modernized, the ascent of
which (p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>) forms the best introduction to a walk through the
city. It marks the spot where the new land-walls on the E. and
W. sides of Galata met in 1348. We mount 143 steps to the room
of the fire-watchmen, and 72 more to the three upper stories.</p>

<p class='c016'>The *<span class='sc'>Panorama</span> from the fourteen windows of the watchmen’s room
embraces Galata with the buildings on the quay; to the N.E. is the Jihangir
Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_544'>544</a>); opposite, on the Asiatic coast, to the extreme left is
the palace of Beylerbey (p. <a href='#Page_558'>558</a>); farther to the S. is Scutari, dominated
by the Great and Little Bulgurlu (p. <a href='#Page_557'>557</a>). To the S.E. lie the Princes
Islands (p. <a href='#Page_535'>535</a>); to the S., above the S. coast of the Sea of Marmora,
rises the Bithynian Olympos (p. <a href='#Page_535'>535</a>). With the aid of the Plan of the
city we may easily locate the chief buildings of Stambul, from the Aya
Sophia and the Ahmed Mosque with its six minarets, to the S., round to
the Great Bazaar with its numerous little domes, to the Place d’Armes
(Séraskier-Kapou), with the great tower, the barracks, and the Suleiman
Mosque, to the Mihrimah Mosque, and to the Byzantine city-wall at the
extreme N. end of Stambul. At our feet lies the Golden Horn, with the
two bridges and the naval harbour. In the distance, to the N.W., peeps
the mosque of Eyúb (see inset map in Plan of city).</p>

<p class='c009'>The modern streets of <b>Pera</b>, the European quarter, run to the
N.W. from the Galata Tower, between old Turkish cemeteries and
large gardens, across the whole hill. The embassies to the Sublime
Porte, the European churches, schools, hospitals, and shops also are
situated here.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Grande Rue de Péra</span> (Pl. H, I, 3, 2), the continuation of
Yüksek Kaldirim, passes the <i>Monastery of the Dancing Dervishes</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>(Tekkeh; Pl. H, 3), whose strange performances may be witnessed
on Fridays (except during Ramadan), usually from 7.30 to 8.30
Turkish time (4½–3½ hrs. before sunset; adm. 5 pias.).</p>

<p class='c011'>We may now cross the Place du Tunnel, past the upper station
of the tunnel railway (Pl. H, 3; p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>), and follow Rue Kabristan
(or one of the narrow streets to the left, farther to the N., such as
the Rue Vénédik) to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Public Grounds of tho Petits Champs</b> (Pl. H, 3, 2),
near the <i>British Embassy</i> (Pl. H, 2) and the chief hotels (p. <a href='#Page_537'>537</a>).
They afford a beautiful view of Stambul and the Golden Horn,
and are a favourite resort in the afternoon and evening (concerts,
see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We return, to the N.E., by Rue Tepé Bachi to the Grande Rue de
Péra, whence the Rue Yéni Teharchi leads to the S.E., past the
<i>Galata Seraï</i> (Pl. H, 2; Imper. Lyceum), to Top Haneh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our street ends, at the N.W. end of Pera, at the <span class='sc'>Place du
Taxim</span> (Pl. 1, 2). Here on the right, adjoining the Kishla Jaddesí,
are the <i>Artillery Barracks</i>, one of the chief scenes of conflict on
25th April 1909 when the Young Turks fought their way into the
city, and the *<b>Taxim Park</b> (Pl. I, 1; band, see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>), and on
the left a large esplanade.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Place du Taxim we may ascend the Ayas Pasha Boulevard,
past the <i>German Embassy</i>, or from the Taxim Park the
Dolma Bagtché Déré (Pl. K, 1; Dolma-garden valley), past the
<i>Ecuries Impériales</i>, to <span class='sc'>Place Dolma Bagtché Déré</span>. On the E.
side of this square, below the suburb of that name, rises the <b>Dolma
Bagcheh Palace</b> (pp. <a href='#Page_558'>558</a>, 546), of which only the high walls
with their superb gateways are seen on the inland side. The sultan
repairs hither weekly in solemn procession (‘selamlik’) to Friday
prayer (at noon), usually offered in the neighbouring <i>Valideh Jami</i>
(mosque of the sultan’s mother; Pl. K, 1, 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>We may now follow the road to the N.E. through the adjacent
suburb of <i>Beshiktash</i>, where, opposite the steamboat pier, rises
the <i>Türbeh Kheireddin Barbarossa</i> (p. <a href='#Page_221'>221</a>), which is best viewed
from the Bosporus. Farther on are the ruins of the Chiragan Seraï
(p. <a href='#Page_558'>558</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the pier of Beshiktash a road leads to the N.E. to the <b>Yildiz
Kiosque</b>, surrounded with barracks and high walls, formerly the
residence of the now deposed sultan Abdul Hamid (1876–1909).
The <i>Palace</i> and its <i>Park</i>, and the private <i>Hamidieh Mosque</i>, built
of white marble, are inaccessible.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is now best to return by tramway (No. 2; p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>) to the large
suburb of <b>Top Haneh</b> (Pl. I, 3), inhabited chiefly by Turks, with
the loftily situated <i>Jihangir Mosque</i> (1553).</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, in the esplanade of the Artillery Arsenal on the Bosporus,
are situated the <i>Mosque of Mahmud II.</i> (1830) and a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>but now roofless <i>Well House</i> of the time of Ahmed II. (1703–30),
resembling the sebíl at the Asab Kapu (p. <a href='#Page_543'>543</a>). The <i>Mosque of
Kilij Ali Pasha</i> (Pl. I, 3) was built by Sinán (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now return to Pera by the Rues Tchoukour Bostan and Yéni
Tcharchi (p. <a href='#Page_544'>544</a>), or by the <span class='sc'>Grande Rue de Galata</span> (Pl. I, H, 3, 4),
the busiest international thoroughfare, to Place Karakeuï (p. <a href='#Page_543'>543</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c023'>b. Stambul.</h4>

<p class='c021'>From the Rue Karakeuï, in Galata, the <b>New Bridge</b> (Pl. H,
4, 5) crosses the Golden Horn (p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>) to Stambul (toll 10 paras;
carr. 2½ pias.). It was originally built of timber in 1845, and called
<i>Sultan Valideh Bridge</i> after its founder (the ‘sultan’s mother’), and
was rebuilt in 1877. The new iron bridge was begun in 1909. It
affords beautiful *Views of Galata and Stambul, of the Bosporus
and the Asiatic coast, while its busy and picturesque traffic presents
scenes of endless variety.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the S. end of the bridge lies the <span class='sc'>Place Emin Eunou</span> (Pl.
H, 5), called also <i>Baluk Bazar</i> or fish-market, beyond which rise
the fine outlines of the—</p>

<p class='c011'>*<b>Yeni Valideh Jami</b> (Pl. H, 5), or ‘new mosque of the sultan’s
mother’. Begun in 1615 by <i>Khoja Kassim</i> for the mother of
Ahmed I., after the model of Ahmed’s Mosque, and damaged by
the great fire of 1660, it was not completed till 1663. In the
middle of the outer court are ranged, as in all the larger Turkish
mosques, the forecourt (harám) with its three portals, the mosque
itself, and the türbeh (p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>), all turned towards Mecca (to the S.E.).</p>

<p class='c016'>The forecourt, with its two elegant minarets and large wooden roofs
above the side-portals, has a remarkably fine octagonal fountain of ablution
(shudrivàn) in the centre.</p>

<p class='c022'>Like the Suleïmanieh (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>) the mosque is preceded by two colonnades.
In the interior the lower wall surfaces and the four massive
pillars of the dome are incrusted with bluish-green tiles. The mihrâb
wall is connected with the pillars by a gallery; adjoining it, near the
mihrâb or prayer-niche itself, are the superb pulpit and the railed-in
gallery of the sultan. The adjacent *Private Rooms of the sultan still
have their original decoration of fayence tiles and stained glass.</p>

<p class='c022'>The Türbeh contains the sarcophagus of the sultan’s mother and the
tombs of five sultans, recognizable by the turban and double heron’s
plume.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the W. side of the outer court is the <b>Missir Charshi</b>
(Pl. G, 5; ‘Egyptian Bazaar’), originally for goods from Egypt, but
now a general market, next in importance to the Great Bazaar
(p. <a href='#Page_551'>551</a>). Among the wares in the open shops of the vaulted street
the chief commodities are spices, drugs, and pigments.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the W. of the Egyptian Bazaar, at the foot of Rue Ousoun
Tcharchi (p. <a href='#Page_551'>551</a>), rises the <i>Mosque of Rustem Pasha</i> (Pl. G, 5), vizier of
Suleiman the Great (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) and husband of his daughter Mihrimah (p. <a href='#Page_553'>553</a>).
It was built by Sinán (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>). The interior is noteworthy chiefly for the
superb effect produced by its fayence tiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>We follow the tramway (No. 3; p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>), to the S.E., through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>Rue Bagtché Kapou, so named after the old ‘garden-gate’ of Stambul,
and the Hamidieh Jaddesi, crossing the broad Bab Ali Jaddesi which
leads to the left to the <i>Railway Station</i> (p. <a href='#Page_537'>537</a>). Farther on we
come to the wall of the Seraglio on the left, and to (10 min.) the
<i>Sublime Porte</i> (Pl. H, 6; vizierate and ministry of foreign affairs)
on the right. Its central part, which contained the ministry of home
affairs and the cabinet was burnt down in Feb. 1911.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>Seraglio</b> or <i>Seraï</i> (Pl. H-I, 5, 7; now officially called
<i>Top Kapu Seraï</i>, ‘seraglio of the cannon-gate’), with its neglected
garden-terraces and miscellaneous buildings, occupies the site of
the Acropolis and oldest streets of Byzantium (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>) and the first
of the seven hills of New Rome. Within the extensive precincts, enclosed
by a pinnacled wall and defended by towers, Mohammed II.
in 1468 erected a summer palace, which Suleiman the Great (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>)
enlarged and made his residence. All the sultans resided here until
Abdul Mejíd built the Dolma Bagcheh Palace (1850–5; p. <a href='#Page_558'>558</a>).
In 1873 the railway was carried through the gardens, past the
<i>Granite Column of Emp. Claudius II.</i> (268–70 A. D.). Around
the palace are grouped the old church of Irene (p. <a href='#Page_548'>548</a>), several
military and other new buildings, the imperial <i>Mint</i>, and the <i>School
of Art</i> founded in 1889.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the chief entrance, the <i>So-uk Cheshmeh Gate</i> (Pl. H, 6),
we ascend to the right, past the Mint, to the first terrace. A road
to the left leads thence, behind the School of Art, to the New
Museum, on the right, and the Chinili Kiosque, on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>New Museum</b> (Pl. I, 6), opened in 1891, contains the
imperial **<i>Collection of Antiquities</i>, the arrangement of which is
still incomplete. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>. Director, Halil Bey.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Ground Floor.</span> The first rooms, on the right and left of the entrance,
contain the sarcophagi, including the famous coffins discovered in 1887
in the so-called royal tombs of Sidon (p. <a href='#Page_470'>470</a>). The two vaults, in which
the rulers of Sidon of the 6–4th cent. B. C. are supposed to have been
buried, contained 26 stone coffins, some in the Egyptian form of a mummy,
with sculptured heads, others shaped like Greek temples. In several cases
their execution is highly artistic. The finest are in (right) Room I: *No. 48.
So-called Satrap’s Coffin, of Ionian workmanship (first half of 5th cent.);
*49. Sarcophagus of the mourning women, in marble, in the form of a
temple, influenced in style by the works of Praxiteles (4th cent.). In
(left) Room II: *No. 75. Lycian sarcophagus, with lid in the form of a
pointed arch, executed under the fresh influence of the Parthenon reliefs
(p. <a href='#Page_517'>517</a>); **76. Alexander sarcophagus, an Attic original (about 300 B. C.),
with traces of rich colouring; 90. Sarcophagus of Tabnit, king of Sidon,
originally that of an Egyptian general (6th cent.). Again, in Room I:
No. 1142. Tomb-stele from Nisyros (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>; about 500 B.C.); 45. Tomb-stele
from Pella, a fine early Greek work like the last; 31–33. Fragments
of Roman sarcophagi (Ulysses fighting against the wooers, etc.); also
leaden coffins from Beirut, Khoms (p. <a href='#Page_412'>412</a>), etc. (Room II contains also
six terracotta coffins from Klazomenæ, 6th cent. B. C.). Among the objects
in the other rooms we note a large Lycian sarcophagus from Trysa (2nd cent.
B. C.); *1179. Late Roman sarcophagus from the region of Konia, with
the recumbent figures of man and wife.</p>

<p class='c022'>A large room is devoted solely to the art and inscriptions of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>Hittites, the dominating race on the Upper Euphrates, in Syria, and in
Asia Minor from about 1500 to 1000 B.C., who were afterwards split up
into small principalities and lost their national characteristics. From
this later period (about 9–8th cent.) date the numerous objects from
Senjerli in N. Syria (among others No. 873. Two sphinxes as a base of a
column). Other relics are from Marrash in N. Syria (840. Lion with inscription)
and from Albistan (835. Limestone pillar).</p>

<p class='c022'>Two rooms are set apart for the Greek-Roman sculptures. Among
the chief early Greek works (6th cent. B.C.) are: No. 5bis. Reliefs from
a tombstone in the form of a pillar, with scenes of peace and war; 8,
133. Torso of Apollo and Relief of Hercules drawing his bow, both from
Thasos; 680. Tomb-stele from Dorylæum in Phrygia; *78. Head of a man,
early Ionian, from Rhodes; 32, 33. Kybele, from Kyme; 1136. Relief,
Birth of Athena, from Chalcedon.—Of the 5th cent.: No. 1189. Caryatid;
1433. Hermes Propylæos, after the famous work of Alkamenes (Roman
copy); *148. Snake’s head from the tripod in the At Meïdán (p. <a href='#Page_549'>549</a>).
Among other creations of the Greek golden age (4th cent.) are: No. 1121.
Statue of a youth; 114. Upper half of a stele, from Kyzikos; 1242. Relief
with a portrait of Euripides; 1028. Relief of a woman playing on the
lyre, from Mysia.—Hellenistic sculptures from Pergamum (p. <a href='#Page_533'>533</a>): *764.
Dancer, from a large circular monument; *1138. Marble head (Alexander
the Great?); 72. Marsyas hanging (a good copy); also important: *709.
Alexander the Great, from Magnesia on the Sipylos; 685. Colossal head
of Zeus, from Troy; 9. Colossal statue of Apollo, from Tralleis; *1423.
Relief of a boatman (?), from Tralleis, in the style of the ‘Alexandrine’
reliefs.—Of Roman origin: 31. Largest representation of the so-called
Thracian horseman, from a triumphal arch at Saloniki.</p>

<p class='c022'>In the room of the Byzantine antiquities we note No. 164. Statue
of the Good Shepherd (3rd cent.?); *1090. Early-Christian pulpit from
Saloniki, with the Adoration of the Magi in detached figures; 189, 190.
Fragments of a column with scenes with figures (Baptism of Christ, etc.;
about 500); also interesting capitals with figures and foliage ornamentation.</p>

<p class='c022'>Two rooms form an Architectural Museum (Asia Minor relics).</p>

<p class='c022'>The <span class='sc'>First Floor</span> is occupied by the Babylonian-Assyrian antiquities
(incl. the glazed terracotta sarcophagi from Nippur, and No. 1027. Votive
relief of king Narâm-Sin, about 3750 B.C.), the unimportant Egyptian
relics, and curiosities from Cyprus (p. <a href='#Page_489'>489</a>), Himyar (region of Yemen in
S. Arabia), and Palmyra. Then collections of bronzes and trinkets from
Schliemann’s excavations at Hissarlik (p. <a href='#Page_534'>534</a>), from the Sidonian sarcophagi
(p. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>), etc.; vases and terracottas from Asia Minor (Hissarlik,
Myrina, Priene), Cos (p. <a href='#Page_490'>490</a>), and Rhodes; glass vessels from Asia Minor,
Cyprus, Syria, and Tripolitania; also a collection of coins.—The N. wing
contains the <i>Museum Library</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elegant <b>Chinili Kiosque</b> (Pl. I, 6; ‘fayence palace’), one
of the oldest Turkish buildings in the city, was erected in 1470
by <i>Kemal ed-Din</i> under Mohammed II., in the Persian style, and
was restored in 1590. In 1908 it was converted into an *<i>Oriental
Art Museum</i>. Adm., see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The two-storied portico (ticket-office on the left) contains tombstones,
etc.—The vestibule, with its original inscribed frieze, is adorned with
well-preserved green *Fayence Tiles.</p>

<p class='c022'>The domed hall and five side-rooms contain Arabian, Persian, and
Turkish fayence, Turkish pottery, seals (tugres), firmans, and irades of
Turkish sultans, woodwork (koran-desks, cabinets, etc.), leather (beautiful
book-bindings), and metal work; also cut gems, Arabian and Venetian
glass, mosque-lamps, embroidery, and *Persian Carpets. The chief treasures
of the collection are the *Prayer Niche from the palace of the Seljuk
sultan Alaeddin at Konia (13th cent.) and a throne of Selim I. (p. <a href='#Page_512'>512</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>Passing the Mint (p. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>) we next enter the outer court of
the Seraglio. In the centre rises the huge <i>Janissaries’ Plane Tree</i>
(Pl. I, 6), where the janissaries (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>) used to meet.—To the left
the <i>Orta Kapu</i> leads to the <i>Seraglio Palace</i> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_540'>540</a>).
It contains the throne-room (Arsh Odasi) of the time of Suleiman
the Great, the Library, the Imperial Treasury (hazneh han), and
the superb Bagdad Kiosque (1639), etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Above the outer court rises, on the right, the <b>Church of Irene</b>
(Pl. I, 6; dedicated to ‘divine peace’), a domed basilica built by
Constantine, and restored first by Justinian after the Nika revolt
(p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>), and again in 740. After the Turkish conquest it was used
as an arsenal, but is now a <i>Military Museum</i> (adm., see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We leave the Seraglio by the <i>Bab i Humayún</i> (Pl. I, 6), the
superb modern gate of the sultan, replacing that of Mohammed II.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the <span class='sc'>Seraï Meïdán</span> (Pl. I, 6, 7; ‘Seraglio Square’), on the
S.W. side of the palace-walls, rises the *<i>Fountain of Ahmed III.</i>,
erected in 1728, the finest sebíl in the city, with a well-preserved
timber roof. Nearly opposite are the Aya Sophia and the <i>Ministry
of Justice</i> (Pl. H, 1, 7), which was the meeting-place of the new
Turkish parliament in 1908–9.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Aya Sóphia Mosque</b> (Pl. H, 7; adm., see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>),
formerly the church of St. Sophia, 4 min. to the S. of the So-uk
Cheshmeh Gate (p. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>), is the most famous edifice in the whole
city. Here in 326, opposite to his palace, Constantine erected a
basilica, which he dedicated to Divine Wisdom (Sophía), and which
after a fire in 415 was rebuilt by Theodosius II. The church having
again been destroyed during the Nika rebellion, Justinian
caused the present sumptuous edifice, which was to eclipse all
others in the empire, to be erected in 532–7 by <i>Anthemios</i> of
Tralleis and <i>Isidoros</i> of Miletos.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plan of the building is nearly square. Its axis, contrary to
custom, runs to the E.S.E., in line with that of the palace. It measures
82½ by 77 yds., but if the atrium or forecourt had still existed
the length would have been no less than 184 yds. The edifice with
its nave and aisles presents a curious combination of an ancient
Christian basilica with a dome-covered mosque. Above the nave,
which is 36 yds. in breadth, the great dome, 105 ft. in diameter
and 184 ft. in height, but externally inconspicuous, rises on four
massive pillars. It is continued lengthwise by two half-domes,
relieved by niches, the large E. central niche forming the apse.
The upper story of the aisles, borne by antique columns with capitals
resembling imposts, and the galleries above the inner vestibule
contained the gynæceum, or women’s seats.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Crusaders pillaged the church in 1204 (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>), and many
of its treasures were carried off also at the Turkish conquest. The
mosaics were whitewashed, the minaret at the S.E. angle was erected,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>and the unsightly flying buttresses were added on the E. side.
To the further detriment of the general effect the successors of the
conqueror built the other three minarets, the mausoleums, schools,
and outbuildings. A thorough restoration was undertaken by <i>Fossati</i>,
an Italian architect, in 1847, when the outside was painted
yellow with red stripes.</p>

<p class='c016'>The entrance for visitors is in the N. side-street, by a door to the
left of the N.W. minaret. A few steps descend to the <span class='sc'>Inner Vestibule</span>
(eso-narthex), from which five doors open on the outer vestibule (exo-narthex)
and nine portals lead into the interior. At the S. end of the
inner vestibule, opposite the N. entrance, is a Byzantine *Bronze Door
(9th cent.), with part of the original panels.</p>

<p class='c022'>The northmost portal admits us to the *<span class='sc'>Interior</span>, in which the immense
central dome, in contrast to St. Peter’s at Rome, dominates the
entire nave. The marble pavement is partly destroyed and partly covered
with carpets and mats spread obliquely in the direction of Mecca (S.E.).
The mihrâb or prayer-recess has been placed, for the same reason, a little
to the S. of the axis of the apse. Beside the pillars of the apse are, on
the right, the mimbar, or Friday pulpit, and on the left the octagonal
grated gallery of the sultan, resting on eight antique columns. The nave
contains several open galleries or tribunes for prayer-recitals. The Koran
niche in the S. aisle also is worth seeing. (Visitors should be careful not
to touch anything.)</p>

<p class='c022'>During the nights of Ramadan (p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>) visitors are admitted only to
the galleries, which the sacristan will show at other times.</p>

<p class='c022'>On the S. side of the mosque, adjoining the Aya Sophia Meïdán, rise
five <span class='sc'>Türbehs</span>, or burial-chapels of sultans. The southmost, once the baptistery
of the church, dates perhaps from Justinian’s reign.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Aya Sóphia Meïdán</span> (Pl. H, 7), a busy square planted with
trees, on the S. side of the mosque, was the ancient <i>Augusteion</i> (or
Agorá), the greatest centre of traffic in New Rome, whence the triumphal
road led to the Golden Gate (p. <a href='#Page_554'>554</a>). Down to the Turkish conquest
it was adorned with a mounted statue of Justinian. Adjoining
it on the S.W. lies the <span class='sc'>At Meïdán</span> (Pl. H, 7; ‘horse square’), 330 yds.
long, partly occupying the site of a <i>Hippodrome</i> begun by Sept.
Severus (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>) and completed by Constantine. From these two
squares, and from the Seraï Meïdán (p. <a href='#Page_548'>548</a>), the Roman and Byzantine
imperial palaces, with their dependencies and several churches,
extended to the S.E. to the town-wall on the Sea of Marmora.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the N. angle of At Meïdán, where Rue Divan Yolou (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>)
diverges, lies a small <i>Public Garden</i>. Farther on, to the S.W.,
passing a <i>Street Fountain</i> presented by Emp. William II. in 1898,
we come to three ancient monuments which still occupy their old
places on the spina of the Hippodrome (comp. p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>). One is the
<i>Obelisk of Theodosius I.</i>, dating from the time of Thutmosis III.
(p. <a href='#Page_456'>456</a>; brought from Heliopolis), with Roman reliefs, on the pedestal,
of the imperial family viewing the races from the court-stand
of the Hippodrome. The second is the bronze *<i>Snake Column</i>,
once the central support of a huge tripod which the Greeks erected
as a votive offering at Delphi after the victory of Platæa (p. <a href='#Page_506'>506</a>).
The third is the so-called <i>Colossus</i>, an obelisk of unknown origin.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>No less conspicuous than the Aya Sophia is the *<b>Mosque of
Ahmed I.</b> (Pl. H, 7), on the S.E. side of At Meïdán. It was built
by the young sultan of that name in 1608–14 as the second-largest
mosque in the city, and is the only one besides the Kaaba at Mecca
that has six minarets. The large outer court, planted with trees
and often used as a market-place, is separated from At Meïdán by
a broken-down wall. The lofty chief portal, with its stalactite niche
and its fine bronze gate, leads into a forecourt flanked with domed
colonnades where we notice the pretty stalactite capitals. In the
centre rises a superb hexagonal marble fountain with a railing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The interior of the mosque (79 by 70 yds.), in the style of the
Mehmedieh (p. <a href='#Page_553'>553</a>), resembles the Shahzadeh mosque (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>) in
the disposition of its four half-domes. The great central dome,
73 ft. in diameter, rests on four clumsy round pillars, and around
it runs a low gallery with depressed keel-arches. The walls are
lined with white marble below and with beautiful fayence tiles
from Nikæa above.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the S.W. of At Meïdán is the <i>Janissaries’ Museum</i> (Pl. G, H, 7;
adm., see p. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>), in which are exhibited wax-figures wearing the ancient
costumes of Turkish dignitaries and the uniforms of the Janissaries, or
old body-guard (1328–1826).</p>

<p class='c022'>To the S. of the Museum, close to the railway, rises the *<b>Küchük
Aya Sóphia</b> (Pl. H, 7, 8), or ‘little’ mosque of Aya Sophia, a kind of
prelude to the ‘great’, now containing a military museum. It was built
under Justinian in 528, at the same time as San Vitale at Ravenna, as a
church of <i>SS. Sergius and Bacchus</i>. The building is nearly square, with
semicircular niches at the angles, and encloses an octagonal interior, between
the eight corner-columns of which are four semicircular niches and
four straight rows of columns. The junction of the walls with the dome
was masked, as later in the Sophia Church, by curved triangular spandrels
or pendentives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the public garden (p. <a href='#Page_549'>549</a>) we enter the <span class='sc'>Rue Divan Yolou</span>
(tramway No. 3, p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>). At the end of it, on the right, is a railed-in
burial-ground containing the handsome <i>Türbeh of Mahmud II.</i>
(d. 1839) and his son Abdul Aziz (sultan in 1861–76). Entrance to
the right, in Rue Mahmoudié.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the main street, now called Sedefdjilar Yolou, we next come
to the second hill of New Rome (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>), crowned with the so-called
<b>Burnt Column</b> (Pl. G, 6; Turk. <i>Chemberli Tash</i>, ‘stone with
the hoop’). This great column of porphyry was erected by Constantine
on the ancient ‘triumphal way’, to mark the centre of his
forum, and bore his statue in bronze down to 1105. It was restored
in 1909. The street then leads past the Kalpakjilar Kapu
(on the right), the S. gate of the Great Bazaar (p. <a href='#Page_551'>551</a>), to the
Bayazid Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_551'>551</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Burnt Column the Rue Nouri Osmanié leads to the N.
to the white marble <i>Mosque of Nuri Osmanieh</i> (Pl. G, 6), a bold
dome-roofed edifice copied from the Selim Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_553'>553</a>), but
with a semicircular forecourt.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>Adjacent on the W. is the *<b>Great Bazaar</b> (Pl. G, 6; Turk.
<i>Büyük Charshi</i>, ‘great market’), one of the sights of Constantinople.
It lies in a depression between the Nuri Osmanieh Mosque
and the Serasker Square (see below) and forms a distinct quarter of
the city, enclosed by gates. As in the sûks (p. <a href='#Page_335'>335</a>) the crafts mostly
have their own streets or districts. Most of the buildings have been
re-erected since the earthquake of 1894. To the early 17th cent. belongs
the still extant castellated <i>Valideh Han</i> (see below); of the
early 18th cent. are the <i>Bezestán</i> (the main central building, founded
in the 10th cent.) and the <i>Sandal Bezestán</i>. Besides genuine
Oriental wares many European goods also are sold here.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Nuri Osmanieh Kapu</i>, on the W. side of the outer court of the
mosque, opens on to the <span class='sc'>Kalpakjilar Bashi Jaddesí</span>, the main thoroughfare
on the S. side of the Bazaar. Immediately on the right is the <i>Sandal
Bezestán</i>, once the silk-bazaar, now a warehouse (usually closed).</p>

<p class='c022'>The street on the N. side (Restaurant Tokatlian, see p. <a href='#Page_537'>537</a>) leads to
the W. after a few paces to the <b>Bezestán</b> (Pl. Bez.; G, 6), where artistic
old weapons, gold and silver wares, inlaid furniture, etc. are displayed.
In the street on the E. side are sold jewels and trinkets; on the N. side
cloth, Oriental antiquities, and books; on the W. side Turkish women’s
apparel and embroidery; on the S. side leather-work, etc.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the W. gate of the Bezestán we pass through the Bezestán
Jaddesí, with its clothes-shops, to the <span class='sc'>Ousoun Tcharchi</span>, the main street
ascending from the Rustem Pasha Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>) to the S. gate (Kalpakjilar
Kapu, p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>). Going straight on we may ascend through the curved
Fesjiler Jaddesi, the fez-market, to the <span class='sc'>Bit Bazar Jaddesi</span>, a street
running to the N. and S., the entrance to the (left) <i>Second-hand Market</i>
(Bat Bazar, jestingly called ‘bit bazar’ or louse-market). In the other
direction, a few paces to the N., is the Hakkaklar Sokak, with the stalls
of the seal-engravers, booksellers, etc., leading to the Bayazid Mosque.</p>

<p class='c022'>Those who intend to return from the Great Bazaar direct to the New
Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>) may visit also the <i>Valideh Han</i> (Pl. G, 5, 6; see above), the
seat of the Persian traders, situated in the Chakmakjilar Yokussu, diverging
to the E. from the Ousoun Tcharchi.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the third hill of the city, the site of the forum of Theodosius I.,
rise the Bayazid Mosque and the Seraskerat in its large court.</p>

<p class='c011'>The *<b>Mosque of Bayazid</b> (Pl. G, 6) was erected in 1489–97
by the Albanian <i>Kheireddin</i>, under sultan Bayazid, son of Mohammed
II., the conqueror. The handsome portals of the forecourt recall
Seljuk prototypes. The beautiful forecourt, enlivened ever since
the time of the founder by countless pigeons, has pointed arcades
with elegant domes. In the centre is an octagonal fountain. The
interior, tastelessly painted in the Turkish rococo style in the
18th cent., is a simplified imitation of the Aya Sophia.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of the mosque the <i>Serasker Kapu</i>, the modern
S. gateway, leads into the court, now a drilling-ground, of the
<i>Seraskerat</i> (Pl. F, G, 5; or ministry of war). Here once stood the
<i>Eski-Seraï</i>, the oldest palace of the sultans (comp. p. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>). The
*<b>Serasker Tower</b> (closed on Frid.; fee 3–5 pias.), about 200 ft.
high, built by Mahmud II. (d. 1839) of white marble from the island
of Marmara (p. <a href='#Page_535'>535</a>), affords a magnificent view of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>Behind the barracks on the N. side of the Seraskerat, or by
the Serasker Jaddesi to the right, we descend to the terrace of the
Suleiman Mosque, which is surrounded by schools, baths, and the
<i>Residence of the Sheikh ul-Islam</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The **<b>Mosque of Suleiman the Great</b> (Turk. <i>Suleïmanieh</i>;
Pl. F, G, 5), erected in 1550–66 by the Albanian <i>Sinán</i>
(Mimar Sinán Agha), on the model of the Aya Sophia and the Bayazid
Mosque, is one of the two master-works of this most famous of
Turkish architects (the other being the Selim mosque at Adrianople).
The superb chief portal on the N.W. side is three stories in
height. At the angles of the forecourt (63 by 49½ yds.) rise four
minarets of unequal height. The exterior of the mosque is embellished
with two arcades; the smaller domes are charmingly
grouped round the great dome; the latter, only 85 ft. in diameter,
is loftier than that of Aya Sophia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding the striped decoration with which it was marred
at the time of the restoration under Abdul Aziz (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>), the interior
surpasses all the other mosques of Constantinople in harmony of
structure, in picturesqueness of perspective, and in magnificence of
ornamentation, but is unfortunately badly lighted. Between the
four pillars of the dome, on each side, are two monolith columns,
29 ft. high, with stalactite capitals, supporting the upper stories of
the aisles. The *Mihrâb Wall is enriched with beautiful fayence
tiles and with stained glass by <i>Serkosh Ibrahim</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the burial-ground behind the mosque rise the handsome
<i>Türbehs of Suleiman</i> (fee 5 pias.) and his favourite wife <i>Roxolana</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the outer court of the mosque, with its fine old cypresses and
plane-trees, we may descend to the E. to Rustem Pasha’s Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>)
and the New Bridge (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>); or we may go to the N.W. to the <i>Old Bridge</i>
(Pl. F, G, 4; p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>; toll 10 paras) and the Rue Iskander (p. <a href='#Page_543'>543</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'>From the W. gate of the Seraskerat, or from the W. angle of
the outer court of the Suleiman mosque, we may soon reach the
two-storied <b>Aqueduct of Valens</b> (Pl. F, E, 6, 5), dating from
the reign of that emperor (368 A. D.) but much restored. It bridges
the space between the fourth and third hills of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the S. side of the aqueduct, near the scene of the great fire of
1908, rises the <i>Shahzadeh Mosque</i> (Pl. E, F, 5; ‘prince’s mosque’),
an early work of Sinán (see above), erected by Suleiman in 1543–7
in memory of his son Mohammed. The plan is similar to that of the
Mehmedieh (see below). It is charmingly fitted up in the interior.
In the two türbehs repose the princes Mohammed and Jíhangir and
the princess Mihrimah. As a rule the muezzin permits visitors to
ascend one of the minarets for a small gratuity.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this mosque the Rue Chahsadé Bachi ascends to the N.W.
to the <b>Mosque of Mohammed II.</b> (Pl. D, E, 4; <i>Mehmedieh</i> or
<i>Fatih Jami</i>; comp. p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>), the holiest in Constantinople after that
of Eyúb (p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>). It was built by the Greek <i>Christodulos</i> in 1463–9
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>on the fourth hill of the city, on the site and with the materials
of the <i>Apostles’ Church</i>. This church, founded by Constantine, had
been restored by Justinian and was famous as the burial-place of
the emperors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The outer court, planted with cypresses, on the N.W. side of
which a busy market is held, is surrounded, as in the Byzantine
age, by a great many miscellaneous buildings. The plan of the
mosque is probably the same as that of the Apostles’ Church. The
forecourt is commanded by two minarets. The interior, in the form
of a Greek cross, has four half-domes in the two axes adjoining the
central dome, four smaller corner-domes, and three galleries. The
whole building was modernized after the earthquake of 1767.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first <i>Türbeh</i> behind the mosque is that of ‘the Conqueror’.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the N.W. corner of the outer court the Sultan Mehmed and
Sultan Selim streets lead to the N. to the <i>Mosque of Selim I.</i> (Pl. E, 3;
Turk. <i>Selimieh</i>) on the fifth city-hill, erected by Suleiman the Great in
1520–6 in memory of his warlike father Selim I. (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>). This is the
simplest of all the sultans’ mosques. The outer walls are roofed with a
single semicircular dome.</p>

<p class='c022'>To the S. of Mehmedieh, between the fourth city-hill and the <i>Lykos
Valley</i>, among the ruins caused by a fire, rises <i>Marcian’s Column</i> (Pl. D,
E, 5; Turk. Kiz Tash, maiden’s stone), erected in honour of that emperor
(450–7).</p>

<p class='c022'>In the Lykos Valley, to the S.W. of Marcian’s Column, once lay the
<i>Barracks of the Janissaries</i> (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>), who were massacred in the Et Meïdán
here (Pl. D, 5; ‘place of flesh’) after a revolt in 1826.—In the <i>Ak Seraï</i>
quarter (Pl. D, E, 6), on the ancient triumphal way (p. <a href='#Page_550'>550</a>), lay the Roman
<i>Forum Boarium</i> (cattle-market). The road ascended thence to the seventh
city-hill. Here, in the quarter now called <i>Avret Bazar</i>, is still seen the
pedestal of the marble <i>Column of Arcadius</i> (Pl. D, 7; Turk. Avret Tash,
women’s stone), the sole surviving relic of the forum of Arcadius.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Mehmedieh a main street (carr. 5 pias.) leads direct
in ¼ hr., to the N.W., to the Edirneh Kapu (see below).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beside the city-wall, near Rue Edirné Kapou, is the sixth and
highest city-hill, on which rises the <i>Mihrimah Mosque</i> (Pl. C, 3),
built in 1556 by Sinán (p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>) for the princess Mihrimah (p. <a href='#Page_545'>545</a>),
on the site of the Byzantine monastery of St. George, and restored
in 1910.—From the Greek <i>Church of St. George</i> we walk about
250 paces to the N.E., and then descend to the right, near the city-wall,
to visit the—</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Kahrieh Mosque</b> (Pl. C, 2), once the church of the monastery
of <i>Chora</i> (‘in the country’), which probably existed before the time
of Theodosius II. It was restored in the 11th cent. and enlarged
in the 14th, and contains famous Byzantine *Mosaics (sacristan
lives near).</p>

<p class='c011'>We now turn our steps to the ruinous <i>Edirneh Kapu</i> (Pl. C, 2;
Adrianople Gate), the gate of Charisius or cemetery-gate (Porta
Polyandriu) of the Byzantines.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside the gate, where stretches the largest <i>Moslem Cemetery</i>
of Stambul, we obtain an excellent view of the old *<b>Land-Wall</b>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>of the city, over 4 M. in length. The chief part of it is the <i>Theodosian
Wall</i> (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>), extending from the Sea of Marmora to the
Tekfur Seraï (see below). This was originally a single wall, defended
by towers, but after an earthquake in 447 it was doubled,
the two walls being 66 yds. apart and, from the bottom of the moat,
100 ft. high.</p>

<p class='c016'>The S. part of the land-wall may be visited by carriage (one-horse 10,
two-horse 10 or 15 pias.; bargaining necessary) from the Edirneh Kapu.
We drive past <i>Top Kapu</i> (Pl. A, 4; ‘cannon-gate’), once the gate of
St. Romanos, famed in the siege of 1453, to Yedi Kuleh railway-station
(Pl. A, B, 9). We may return thence to the town by local train (about
every ½ hr.), or from the Yedi Kuleh Gate by tramway (No. 4; change
at Ak Seraï, p. <a href='#Page_553'>553</a>), or from Psamatia Kapu (Pl. B, 8) by local steamer
(p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Near the S. end of the wall rises the castle of <b>Yedi Kuleh</b> (Pl. A, 9;
‘seven towers’; adm. except Sun. 2½ pias.; small fee to lantern-bearer),
rebuilt by Mohammed II., within which is the dilapidated <i>Porta Aurea</i>
(‘golden gate’), once the triumphal gate of the Byzantine emperors.—On
the Sea of Marmora, at the point where the land-wall joined the <i>Marmora
Sea Wall</i>, rises the octagonal <i>Mermer Kuleh</i> (Pl. A, 9; ‘marble tower’),
the sole relic of a castle of the time of Emp. Basil II. (976–1025).</p>

<p class='c009'>To the N.E. of the Edirneh Kapu, beyond the <i>Greek Cemetery</i>
(Pl. C, 2), the Theodosian city-wall is joined by the single but
stronger <i>Wall of the Blachernae Quarter</i> (‘marsh-land quarter’).
This wall served for the defence of the famous St. Mary’s Church
of the empress Pulcheria (ca. 450), and for that of the Blachernæ
Palace, founded at the end of the 5th cent., which in the 12th cent.
became the imperial residence instead of the older palaces in the
Augusteion (p. <a href='#Page_549'>549</a>). The wall dates partly from the reigns of Emp.
Heraklios (610–41), Leo V. (813–20), and Manuel Comnenus (1143–80),
but was largely rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ruined Byzantine palace rising above the town-wall near the
small <i>Kerkoporta</i> (Pl. C, 2), the so-called <i>Tekfur Seraï</i> (‘emperor’s
palace’), was probably founded by Constantine VII. Porphyrogenetos
(912–59). Of the <i>Blachernae Palace</i> itself the foundations are
still traceable between the <i>Egri Kapu</i> (Pl. C, 1; once Porta Kaligaria)
and the Aivas Effendi Mosque. To the old terrace of the
palace belonged the massive <i>Towers of Isaak Angelos</i> and <i>Anemas</i>
(Pl. C, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. side the land-walls end with the picturesque castle
of <i>Brachionon</i> or <i>Pentapyrgion</i>, answering to the Yedi Kuleh on
the S. side. It lies between the inner and the site of the outer
Blachernæ gate. Near it are buried the Arabs who fell in 678
(p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the <i>Aivan Seraï Kapu</i> (Pl. D, 1), which belongs to the
old <i>Sea Wall on the Golden Horn</i> (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>), a broad road to the
left (N.W.) leads through the suburb of <i>Ortakjilar</i> (Pl. B, C, 1) to
(¾ M.) Eyúb (p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>). Straight on, we soon reach the Aivan Seraï
pier (p. <a href='#Page_555'>555</a>).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>
  <h4 class='c023'>c. The Golden Horn.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>By <span class='sc'>Caïque</span> (p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>) from the New Bridge to Eyúb about 1 hr., to the
Sweet Waters 1½–2 hrs. (there and back 20–25 pias.). The row back is particularly
fine towards sunset.—<span class='sc'>Steamboat</span> (p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>) to Eyúb in ¾ hr.,
thence to the Sweet Waters 20 min.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Golden Horn</b>, already named <i>Chrysokeras</i> by the Greeks,
an arm of the sea 4½ M. long and at the widest point ½ M. across,
probably a submerged side-valley of the Bosporus, is one of the
finest natural harbours in the world. In the Byzantine period it
was closed for defensive purposes by a chain. It consists of the
<i>Outer Commercial Harbour</i> (Pl. H, I, 4, 5), with the Galata Quay
(p. <a href='#Page_543'>543</a>) and the new quays on the Stambul side, the <i>Inner Commercial
Harbour</i> (Pl. G, H, 4), between the two bridges, and the
<i>Naval Harbour</i> (Pl. E-G, 2, 3).</p>

<p class='c011'>The voyager on the Golden Horn is chiefly struck with the
busy harbour scenes and the picturesque appearance of the crowded
Oriental quarters rising from the banks. Starting from the
New Bridge (Pl. H, 4) the steamer crosses the inner commercial
harbour to the pier of <i>Yemish Iskelesí</i> (Pl. G, 4) at Stambul, at the
foot of the terrace of the Suleiman Mosque, and then passes under
the Old Bridge (Pl. F, G, 4; p. <a href='#Page_552'>552</a>) into the naval harbour. On the
Stambul side it first calls at the piers of <i>Jubali Kapu</i> and <i>Aya
Kapu</i> (Pl. F, 3), the latter lying below Selim’s Mosque (p. <a href='#Page_553'>553</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, on the same side, are the piers of <i>Phanar</i> (Pl. E, 2), the
Greek quarter, where a terrible massacre took place in 1821, and
<i>Balat</i> (Pl. D, 2), the largest Jewish quarter.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the opposite bank, from the Old Bridge onwards, lie the
dockyard buildings. On the bay of <i>Kasím Pasha</i> (calling-place
of some of the steamboats) is the <i>Ministry of Marine</i> (Divan
Haneh; Pl. G, 2, 3), with its surrounding barracks, workshops, and
docks. In front of it are anchored men-of-war and guard-ships.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer next touches at <i>Ters Haneh</i> (Pl. E, 2), on the E.
bank, at the end of the dockyard, and at the Jewish quarter of
<i>Haskiöi</i> (Has Keuï; Pl. E, 1); then, on the W. bank, at <i>Aivan Seraï</i>
(Pl. D, 1; p. <a href='#Page_554'>554</a>), where we have a fine view of the N.E. end of the
land-walls and the beginning of the sea-wall on the Golden Horn;
then, on the E. bank, at <i>Kalijeh Oglu</i>, and on the W. bank at <i>Defterdar
Iskelesí</i> (Pl. C, 1) and <i>Eyúb</i> (see inset plans in Plan of City).</p>

<p class='c011'>In the suburb of *<b>Eyúb</b>, a few minutes’ walk from the pier, is
the famous <i>Mosque of Eyúb</i>, where the ceremony of girding each
new sultan with the sword takes place. It was built of white marble
by Mohammed II., the Conqueror, in 1459, adjacent to the türbeh of
Abu Eyúb Ensari, the legendary standard-bearer of the prophet,
whose tomb here was revealed in a vision a few days after the conquest.
The spot is so revered by the Moslems that until now no
Christian dared set foot even in the outer court. Since the establishment
of the new Turkish government, however, visitors may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>enter the deeply impressive court and even the mosque itself, but
they should be careful not to remain standing between the railings
in the centre of the court and the gilded windows on the wall-side.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the mosque, up the hill-side to the N.E., extends the picturesque
<i>Cemetery</i>, with its venerable cypresses. A path ascends
from the mosque, past a monastery (<i>Tekkeh</i>) of the dancing dervishes
(p. <a href='#Page_543'>543</a>), to the top, where we have a splendid *View of
both banks of the Golden Horn.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Eyúb a smaller local steamer plies through the <i>Stambul Liman</i>,
the shallow N.W. arm of the Golden Horn, 1¼ M. long, to <i>Kiathaneh</i>, or
<i>Kiahat Haneh</i>; this trip, on Fridays or Sundays in spring, affords an
interesting picture of Turkish life. At Kiathaneh two streams fall into the
Golden Horn, the so-called <b>Sweet Waters of Europe</b> (the Asiatic
waters, see p. <a href='#Page_558'>558</a>), or <i>Eaux Douces</i>. The eastmost is the <i>Kiathaneh
Suyu</i>, in the valley of which, about 1¼ M. up, is a château of the sultan,
the most popular holiday resort of the citizens of Constantinople. In the
meadows, under shady trees, are erected huts and arbours, where music
and amusements of all kinds are provided. The Moslems enjoy themselves
sedately here on Fridays; the Christians come on Sundays; hither too
the people of fashion ride or drive. Shortly before sunset a whole flotilla
of boats on the Golden Horn returns home to the city.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>d. Scutari.</h4>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Steam Ferry Boats</span> from the <i>New Bridge</i> (see p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>) and <i>Beshiktash</i>
to Scutari. Those from the New Bridge to the minor stations <i>Salajak</i>,
near the Leander tower, and <i>Harem-Iskelesí</i>, below the Selimieh Barracks
(p. <a href='#Page_536'>536</a>), are less frequent and are seldom used by strangers.—<span class='sc'>Carriages</span>
have the same tariff as in the city (p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>). Drive from the pier to the Chamlija
Spring and back viâ the Great Cemetery (about 2½ hrs.) 1½ mejidiehs
(30 pias.).—<span class='sc'>Horse</span> to the Bulgurlu about 1 mej.</p>

<p class='c009'>The steamer leaves the Seraglio Point on the right and steers
to the E. to (¼ hr.) the chief landing-place at Scutari, which lies
on the Asiatic shore, in a bay to the N. of the promontory. To the
right, off the end of the promontory, is a flat islet on which rises
the so-called <i>Leander’s Tower</i> (by the Turks named <i>Kiz Kulesí</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> maiden’s tower, from the legend that a sultan’s daughter was
once kept here), with a signalling station and lights.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Scutari</b> (no European inns), Turk. <i>Üsküdar</i>, the ancient
<i>Chrysopolis</i>, the harbour of Chalcedon (p. <a href='#Page_536'>536</a>), now a large suburb
of Constantinople, contains 90,000 inhab., comparatively few of
whom are Armenians and Greeks. Its fine old mosques, its crooked
streets, and its small timber houses give it a more Oriental character
than Stambul. Until a century ago Scutari was the terminus
of the caravan-routes from Asia Minor, by which the treasures of
the East were brought to Constantinople. It is still the starting-point
of the sacred annual Mecca caravan.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the pier we follow the broad main street past the <i>Büyük
Jami</i> (‘Great Mosque’; 1547), on the left, and the <i>Yeni Valideh
Jami</i> (1707–10), on the right, beyond which a road to the right
diverges to the Dervishes’ Monastery and the Great Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>The street, inclining to the left, next leads to the quarters of
<b>Yeni Mahalleh</b>, with an Armenian cemetery, and <b>Baglar Bashi</b>;
then, past villas, to the village of <b>Bulgurlukiöi</b>. Before the village
is reached a road to the left leads to (2 M. from the pier) the
<b>Chamlija Spring</b>, shaded by great plane-trees, a favourite Friday
and Sunday resort like the Sweet Waters (p. <a href='#Page_556'>556</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>We may thence ascend (to the N., ¼ hr.) the <b>Great Bulgurlu</b>
or <i>Büyük Chamlija</i> (879 ft.; small café, bargaining necessary),
which, in the forenoon especially, affords a superb *View of Constantinople,
the Bosporus, and the Sea of Marmora.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the way back we turn to the left, skirting the Armenian
cemetery, to visit the *<i>Great Cemetery</i> (Büyük Mezaristán), the
largest Moslem burial-ground in the East. The lower road through
it leads to the N. to the <i>Monastery of the Howling Dervishes</i> (Rufaï
Tekkeh; no admittance).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S. of the Great Cemetery lies <i>Haidar Pasha</i> (p. <a href='#Page_536'>536</a>),
with a large <i>Military Hospital</i>, where Florence Nightingale (1820–1910)
first devoted herself to her philanthropic work. Adjoining the
Hospital is the <i>British Cemetery</i>, containing a tall granite Obelisk
in memory of the British who fell in the Crimean war.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>e. The Bosporus.</h4>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Local Steamers</span> (p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>), with 17 stations on the European side and
12 on the Asiatic, never all touched at on the same voyage. To <i>Rumeli
Kavak</i>, the northmost station on the W. shore, in 2 hrs., 5 (in summer 6)
steamers only. From any station it is easy to ferry to the opposite shore
(5–10 pias.).</p>

<p class='c009'>The Thracian *<b>Bosporus</b> (‘ox-ford’, from the Greek myth that
Io swam in the shape of a cow from Asia to Europe), Turk. Kara
<i>Denis Boghaz</i> or <i>Stambul Boghaz</i> (Black Sea or Stambul Straits),
which, like the Dardanelles (p. <a href='#Page_534'>534</a>), was formed by the subsidence
of a river-valley in the tertiary period (comp. p. xxxiv), connects the
Sea of Marmora with the Black Sea. Length 20 M., breadth about
2 M., average depth 89 ft. (greatest about 395 ft.). A surface-stream,
quickened by the prevailing N.E. winds, and consisting
of the fresher water of the Black Sea, fed by its copious rivers,
constantly pours through the straits towards the Mediterranean,
while the saltier and heavier water of the latter flows in the opposite
direction in a strong under-current into the Black Sea. The steep
coast-hills of the N. part, as far as Rumeli Kavak, consist of eruptive
rock, basalt, dolerite, and trachyte; in the S. part the prevailing
formations are Devonian, clay-slate, greywacke, quarzite, and
limestone. The peninsula of Stambul is of the miocene formation.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trip on the Bosporus affords a highly picturesque and varied
panorama of the scenery on its banks, and on the way back we
suddenly obtain a striking view of the great city and its suburbs.

<p class='c009'>The <b>Black Sea</b> (Turk. <i>Kara Denis</i>; Russ. <i>Chornoye More</i>;
p. xxxiv), the <i>Pontus Euxinus</i> of the ancients, sometimes deserves
its name for the dark-blue hue of its waters, which is markedly
different from the blue of the Mediterranean. Its area, nearly
equal to that of the Baltic, amounts to 163,689 sq. M., without
including the 14,519 sq. M. of the <i>Sea of Azov</i> (p. xxxiv) which is
united with the Black Sea by the narrow Straits of Kertch (p. <a href='#Page_570'>570</a>)
and separated from the shallow Gulf of Odessa (p. <a href='#Page_564'>564</a>) by the
Crimean Peninsula. The basin proper of the Black Sea is a huge
depression, falling away rapidly from its margin to its centre,
where it reaches a depth of ca. 7365 ft. Its flow and ebb are not
perceptible. Owing to the great rivers it receives its surface-water
is but slightly salt (1.8 per cent), but the deep water is more
saline (2.2 to 2.3 per cent). The bottom is coated with black mud
impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen and is therefore entirely
destitute of animal life. On warm summer nights the phosphorescence
of the water is very observable. As in the Mediterranean,
the vessels are often followed by dolphins.</p>

<p class='c011'>During almost the whole of summer gentle N. and N.E. winds,
with a clear sky, prevail in the S.W. part of the Black Sea. At
other seasons the wind is very variable. The N.W. and W. winds
often bring fog, which makes the entrance of the Bosporus difficult.
In winter and about the time of the equinox dangerous storms
from the S. and S.E. are by no means rare.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rumanian and Italian vessels pursue a N. course through
the <i>Black Sea</i>, long affording fine retrospects of the precipitous
shores of Anatolia and the fissured promontories of the Rumelian
coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steering to the N.W. the Odessa steamer of the Austrian Lloyd
reaches the open sea off <i>Rumelí Fanar</i> (p. <a href='#Page_560'>560</a>). It again, however,
approaches the Rumelian coast abreast of <i>Cape Iniada</i>
(Turk. <i>Kuru Burnu</i>), the <i>Thynias Promontorium</i> of the ancients.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond the far-projecting <i>Cape Kuratan</i> or <i>Zeitün Burnu</i>
(lights), belonging to <i>S. Bulgaria</i> (formerly <i>E. Rumelia</i>), opens
the wide <i>Gulf of Burgas</i>. We pass the peninsula of <i>Sozopolis</i>
and the lighthouses of the islands of <i>Megalo Nisi</i> and <i>Anastasia</i>,
and enter the <i>Bay of Burgas</i>, which runs deeply into the land
from the middle of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Burgas</b> (Hôt. Commercial, etc.), the modern Greek <i>Pyrgos</i>,
is the chief harbour of S. Bulgaria (11,700 inhab.) and lies at the
head of the bay between large lagoons. The harbour is tolerably
sheltered from the E. wind by two moles. The chief exports are
grain and attar of roses.</p>

<p class='c011'>In continuing our voyage we pass the peninsula of <i>Mesembriya</i>
(the ancient <i>Mesembria</i>) and <i>Cape Emine</i> (lighthouse), the N. horn
of the Bay of Burgas, forming a spur of the well-wooded <i>Little
Balkan Range</i>, the old frontier between E. Rumelia and Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the N. margin of the Balkan Mts. lies <b>Varna</b>, the ancient
<i>Odessos</i>, now the chief seaport of Bulgaria (pop. 35,000), where
some of the Austrian Lloyd steamers call. The entrance to the
bay of Varna, open towards the E., is bounded on the S. by <i>Cape
Galata</i> (<i>Galata Burnu</i>; lighthouse) and on the N. by <i>Cape St.
George</i>. The anchorage, between two long moles, is similar to that
of Burgas. The <i>Devna Canal</i> connects the bay with <i>Lake Devna</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on the steamer rounds <i>Cape Kaliakra</i> (Turk. <i>Chiliga
Burnu</i>; lighthouse), jutting far to the S., and rejoins the course
of the direct steamer from the Bosporus to Constantza. Next comes
<i>Cape Shabla</i> (lights), 10–12 M. to the N. of which lies the village
of <i>Ilanjik</i>, on the border between Bulgaria and the Rumanian
<i>Dobruja</i>. At night the position of the flat coast is revealed by

<p class='c009'><i>Odessa</i> (154 ft.), in the province of Khersón, is the chief
commercial and industrial place on the Black Sea and the fourth-largest
town of the Russian Empire (pop. 500,000, including at
least 175,000 Jews). It is the seat of an archbishop of the Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>church and of a modern Russian University, and it is the headquarters
of the 8th army-corps. It lies in 46°28′ N. lat. and 30°45′
E. long, and extends for a distance of about 4 M. over the elevated
and treeless steppe. The winter climate is consequently very severe
(mean temperature in Jan. 25° Fahr., July 73°, annual mean 49°).
Its wide and well-paved streets, crossing each other at right angles
and generally planted with trees, make it one of the most regularly
laid out and most handsome cities in Russia. Attractive parks have
been as it were wrested from the barren soil by dint of untiring
perseverance and unstinted care.</p>

<p class='c016'>The rescript in which Catharine II. ordered the foundation of the
town was dated May, 1794, and its foundation-stone was laid by Admiral
J. de Ribas in August of the same year. The new city, which sprang
up on the site of the small Tartar and Turkish village of <i>Chadshibéy</i>,
was probably named after the Sarmatian harbour of <i>Odessos</i> which is said
to have lain in this neighbourhood. From 1817 to 1859 Odessa was a
free harbour. It was greatly improved by the efforts of two of its governors,
the Duc de Richelieu (1803–14) and Prince Vorontsóv (1823–54). During
the Crimean war the town was attacked unsuccessfully by the British
and French fleets in 1854, and the blockade by Turkish war-ships in 1876–7
was equally fruitless. The excesses of the revolution of 1905 were nowhere
more ghastly than at Odessa.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Harbour</b> (347 acres in area), which in winter has sometimes
to be kept open by ice-breakers, consists of an outer harbour
(154 acres) and five inner basins. Effective protection against
all sea-winds is afforded by a breakwater (1334 yds. long), the
quarantine mole (1120 yds. long), and the so-called roadstead mole
(710 yds. long), forming a continuation of the last. The so-called
<i>Quarantine Harbour</i> (Pl. E, F, 5) is for foreign vessels; the <i>New
Harbour</i> (Pl. E, 4), between the Platonovsky and New moles,
and the <i>Coal Harbour</i> (Pl. D, E, 4) are for Russian traders; the
<i>Practical Harbour</i> (Pl. D, 3, 4) is for coasting vessels. To the N.
of the town, opposite the suburb of <i>Peressyp</i>, where a second breakwater
and new docks are projected, lies the <i>Petroleum Harbour</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Opposite the New Mole (Pl. E, 4) is a massive <i>Flight of Granite
Steps</i> (193 in number) ascending to the level of the town. It is
adjoined by a wire-rope elevator (3 or 2 cop.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The finest feature of this part of the town is the *<b>Nikoláyevsky
Boulevard</b> (Pl. D, E, 4, 5), a broad street ¼ M. in
length, which stretches along the margin of the plateau above the
harbour, commanding an unimpeded view of the sea. It is bounded
on one side by a series of handsome buildings, on the other by
four rows of trees and pleasant grounds. In spring this is the
rendezvous of the fashionable world, just as the Deribássovskaya
(p. <a href='#Page_567'>567</a>) is in winter. Towards the N. the houses end with the
<i>Vorontsóv Palace</i>. The <i>Imperial Palace</i> (Pl. D, 5) is also the
residence of the general in command of the Odessa Military District.
At the entrance to the Yekateríninskaya a bronze statue of
the <i>Duc de Richelieu</i> (Pl. 32; see above) was erected in 1826.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>A little to the S.W., in Catharine Square, rises the <i>Monument
of Empress Catharine II.</i> (Pl. 31; D, 4), by Dmítrenko and Popóv
(1900). Round the pedestal bearing the bronze statue of the empress
are figures of Prince Potémkin (in front), Count Súbov (on the right),
Col. de Volant (left), and Admiral J. de Ribas (at the back). The
monument is 35 ft. high.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this point the Yekateríninskaya, one of the main streets
of the city, leads towards the S. Just beyond the Theatre Square
(see below) we turn to the right and follow the <span class='sc'>Deribássovskaya</span>
(Pl. C, D, 5), a short street with the finest shops in Odessa, skirting
the <i>Deribássov Garden</i>, to the—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sobórnaya Square</span> (Pl. C, 5), with its pleasure-grounds and
fountain. On the W. side of the square rises the <i>Cathedral of the
Transfiguration</i> (Pl. 13), founded in 1794, in length 114, in breadth
46 yds., and 164 ft. high. It has a dome, rising over the centre,
and a tower 266 ft. high. In the interior, to the right of the main
entrance, is the tomb of Prince Vorontsóv (d. 1856; see below).—In
the grounds to the N. of the church is a bronze statue of <i>Prince
Vorontsóv</i> (Pl. 22; p. <a href='#Page_566'>566</a>), by Brugger (1863).—On its E. side
the square is skirted by the <i>Preobrashénskaya</i> (Pl. C, D, 7–4), the
longest street in the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the N. of the Sobórnaya Square diverges from the last-named
street to the N.W. the Khersónskaya, with the building of the <i>New
Russian University</i> (Pl. 30; C, 4), which was opened in 1865 and
contains archæological, natural history, and other collections (open
on Sun. 12–2).—At the N. end of the Torgóvaya (Pl. B, C, 4, 5) is
the <i>Rússov Picture Gallery</i>, with modern Russian paintings (shown
on application).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the Sadóvaya is the <span class='sc'>New Bazaar Square</span> (Pl.
C, 4), where a market is held daily. The <i>Market Hall</i> is overshadowed
by a massive building of 1847, the large <i>Sryétenskaya</i>
or <i>Novobasárnaya Church</i> (Pl. 18), with five domes.</p>

<p class='c011'>We return by Deribássovskaya to the <span class='sc'>Theatre Square</span>. The
handsome <b>Town Theatre</b> (Pl. 29; D, 5) was erected by the
Viennese architects <i>Fellner</i> and <i>Hellmer</i> (1887).</p>

<p class='c011'>A few paces to the W. of Theatre Square, at the S. end of the
Nikoláyevsky Boulevard (p. <a href='#Page_566'>566</a>), rises the <span class='sc'>Town Hall</span> (<i>Dúma</i>;
Pl. 7, D, E, 5), an edifice in the Greek style, with a portico of twelve
columns. Adjacent are a fountain with a bronze bust of the poet
<i>Alexander Púshkin</i> (1799–1837; p. <a href='#Page_570'>570</a>) and a cannon from the
British man-of-war ‘Tiger’, sunk in 1854.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the square in front of the Dúma is the <i>Museum of Antiquities</i>
(Pl. 3; D, 5), with objects found at the Greek colonies on
the Black Sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Dúma the <span class='sc'>Púshkinskaya</span> leads to the <i>Main Railway
Station</i> (p. <a href='#Page_564'>564</a>). To the left, at the corner of the Kondratenko
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>Street, is the <i>Exchange</i> (Pl. 5; D, 6), a tasteful erection by Bernadazzi
(1899).</p>

<p class='c011'>To the E. of the E. end of the Kondratenko Street, above the
Quarantine Harbour (p. <a href='#Page_566'>566</a>), lies the <b>Alexander Park</b> (Pl. E,
5, 6; restaurant, see p. <a href='#Page_565'>565</a>), a popular resort where open-air concerts
take place in summer in favourable weather. The <i>Monument
of Alexander II.</i>, a tall column of labradorite, commemorates a
visit of that monarch in 1875. About ½ M. farther out is <i>Lansherón</i>,
a sea-bathing place (tramway, see p. <a href='#Page_565'>565</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>From Lansherón a series of villas (datshas) and private gardens
extends along the sea to the <i>Little Fountain</i> (tramway), with
a garden-restaurant (band) and good sea-bathing, <i>Arkadia</i> (tramway;
band), the <i>Middle Fountain</i> (steam-tramway, see p. <a href='#Page_565'>565</a>; excellent
beach), and the <i>Great Fountain</i> (reached from the terminus of the
steam-tramway by cab, 20–30 cop.), a village with the extensive <i>Uspénskiy
Monastery</i>, the goal of an annual pilgrimage. These three
villages take their name from a spring which once supplied Odessa
with water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still farther to the S. is the German colony of <i>Lustdorf</i> or <i>Olgino</i>,
with vineyards and frequented sea-baths (tramway from the
Great Fountain in 20 min., fare 20 cop.; cab 1½–2 roub.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The flat <i>Cape Tarkhankut</i> (lighthouse), the W. extremity of the

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>As soon as we have rounded the flat <i>Cape Chersonese</i> (lighthouse),
the S.W. extremity of the Crimea, we see before us the S. coast of
the peninsula, rising gradually to the precipices of Cape Aiya.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the left rises <i>Cape Fiolente</i>, the <i>Parthenium</i> of the ancients,
the supposed site of the sanctuary of Artemis in which Iphigenia
served as priestess. Beyond it, above the steep and wooded shore,
is <i>St. George’s Monastery</i>, founded in 988.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the distance, between bare rocks on either hand, is the
narrow entrance to the <i>Bay of Balaclava</i>, supposed to correspond
with Homer’s description of the Læstrygonian Bay (Odyss. X, 86–94).
The picturesque little town of <i>Balaclava</i>, the ancient <i>Symbolon
Portus</i> and the seat in the middle ages of the Genoese colony
of <i>Cémbalo</i>, was the chief base of the British army in the
Crimean war, famed for the gallant charge of the Light Brigade
(25th Oct., 1854), commemorated by Tennyson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Cape Aiya</i> (1919 ft.), which in clear weather is visible

Crimea, below the <i>Church of Foros</i> and the <i>Baidar Gate</i> (1634 ft.;
celebrated for its view), the Lloyd vessels pursue an E.S.E. course
direct for Batum. The picturesque and exuberantly fertile coast
of the so-called <i>Russian Riviera</i> lies to our left, but all that we
can descry are the precipitous <i>Cape Kikeneïs</i>, the range of the
<i>Ai-Petri</i> (4046 ft.), and the distant Cape Ai-Todór (see below).</p>

<p class='c016'>The <span class='sc'>Russian Steamer</span> calls first at <i>Sebastopol</i> (p. <a href='#Page_568'>568</a>) and beyond
Cape Sarýtsh steers near the coast. The chief points visible are <i>Mshátka</i>,
<i>Miláss</i> (recognizable by its four towers), Cape Kikeneïs (see above), and the
lofty and abrupt cliff of <i>Divo</i>, below <i>Lemény</i>. We soon sight the superb

next go by the ‘Lower Road’ to the adjoining park of <i>Oreánda</i> (carr. from
Yalta 3 roub. 20 cop.), which likewise is imperial property. Since it was
burned in 1882 the castle has remained a ruin. A good view is obtained
from the <i>Krestóvaya Gorá</i> (614 ft.) or ‘Hill of the Holy Cross’.</p>

<p class='c022'>About 11 M. to the S.W. of Yalta (carr. 3 roub. 20 cop.; also local

in the Gothic-Moorish style, built by Blore in 1837 for Prince Vorontsóv
(p. <a href='#Page_566'>566</a>).—About 9 M. to the N.E. of Yalta is <i>Gursuff</i> (carr. 5 roub. 60 cop.;
also local steamers), in a charming situation, with good sea-baths. In
the former château of the Duc de Richelieu Púshkin (p. <a href='#Page_567'>567</a>) lived in 1820.</p>

<p class='c022'>Beyond Yalta the direct Russian steamers continue their voyage along
the coast, which farther on becomes increasingly level, to <i>Feodossiya</i> or
<i>Theodosia</i> (p. xxxiv), the chief commercial port of the Crimea. Hence
they steer to the S.E., leaving the <i>Straits of Kertch</i> (see below) to the
left, to the beautifully situated seaport of <i>Novorossysk</i>. From the last
port to <i>Batum</i> the steamers follow a similar course to that of the Lloyd

<p class='c011'>The S.W. slope of the <i>Great Caucasus</i>, the mighty frontier-wall

<p class='c009'><i>Batum</i>, a town of ca. 30,000 inhab., was the ancient <i>Bathys</i>,
a place of little importance. In modern times, under the name of
<i>Bathumi</i>, it was a Turkish frontier-fortress down to 1878. By the
terms of the Berlin Congress of that year it passed to Russia (along
with Kars), and it is now the strongly-fortified capital of the
Russian province of its own name. The town, which has the most
important harbour on the E. coast of the Black Sea, owes its present
prosperity to the construction of the railway to Bakú, on the
Caspian Sea. The staples of its trade are petroleum products (annual
exports 1¼ million tons), manganese ore, liquorice, silk-cocoons,
and wool. Along the beach runs the <i>Boulevard</i>, above
which to the S. rises the <i>Alexander Névsky Cathedral</i>, built in
1903. About ¾ M. to the S. lies the <i>Railway Station</i>, and near
by is a <i>Roman Catholic Church</i>. In the W. part of the town, on
<i>Lake Nurie</i>, is the <i>Alexander Park</i>, with subtropical vegetation.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the S.W. of the town, beyond Cape Batum, is the marshy and
fever-stricken <i>Delta of the Chorokh</i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>Most of the Austrian, French, and Italian vessels are small old cargo-boats.

of the <i>Great Caucasus</i> (p. <a href='#Page_570'>570</a>). The rugged mountains of the
<i>Lazistan</i>, covered with snow in winter, become visible as far as
the <i>Kolat Dagh</i> (about 7540 ft.) and are equally impressive. There
are numerous small towns on the coast, but the only one called at
by the steamers is <i>Rizeh</i> (the ancient <i>Rhizūs</i>), the first seaport
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>beyond the Turkish frontier, which is almost hidden by a forest of
fruit-trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next pass the headland <i>Erekli Burnu</i>. As we near Trebizond
we see the delta of the brook <i>Piksit Su</i> or <i>Matshka</i> (the
ancient <i>Pyxites</i>), where, according to a vague tradition, the ten
thousand Greeks under Xenophon encamped in 400 B.C. on their

<p class='c009'><i>Trebizond</i>, the Turkish <i>Tirabson</i> or <i>Tarábosan</i>, the seat of
the governor-general of the viláyet of the same name and of a
Greek and an Armenian archbishop, is, next to Samsun, the most
important seaport on the N. coast of Asia Minor. It contains
35,000 inhab., including Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Persians, and
Lazis, who speak a dialect resembling the languages of the S. Caucasus.
<i>Trapezūs</i>, founded by Milesians from Sinope (7th cent.
B.C.?), was named after the ‘table’-shaped (‘trápeza’) castle-hill
(p. <a href='#Page_573'>573</a>). Next to the mother-city it was the most important Greek
colony in what afterwards became the kingdom of Pontus (p. <a href='#Page_575'>575</a>),
and was the seat of a governor in the Byzantine period. After the
conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) it became
the capital of the small Greek empire of the <i>Comneni</i>, the last of
whom, <i>David Comnenus</i>, was overthrown by Mohammed II. (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>)
in 1461.</p>

<p class='c011'>Trebizond is picturesquely situated on three low ridges at the
N. base of <i>Boz Tepeh</i> (800 ft.), an outlier of the mountains extending
thence to the S. to the Kolat Dagh (p. <a href='#Page_571'>571</a>). The small
harbour facilitates trade with the towns of the hinterland (<i>e. g.</i>
Gümüshkhaneh), but it is only partly protected against sea-winds
by the pier at <i>Kalmek Point</i> and a new breakwater at the headland
of <i>Eleusa</i>. Notwithstanding the competition of Batum and
the Trans-Caucasian railway Trebizond still carries on a considerable
camel-caravan traffic with the Armenian highlands (Erzerum)
and N. Persia (Tabriz).</p>

<p class='c011'>The trade and industry of Trebizond are concentrated in the
new town on the <span class='sc'>East Hill</span>, above the harbour. Beyond Kalmek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>Point, on which are a battery, a lighthouse, and the <i>Güzel Seraï</i>
(Pl. B, C, 1; now artillery-barracks), lies the Greek quarter, which
encloses the Frank quarter, the seat of the European wholesale
merchants. On a small promontory projecting from the N. shore
rises the <i>Greek Cathedral</i> (Pl. 6; B, 1).</p>

<p class='c011'>A little to the N. of the <i>Hurriyet Meïdan</i>, with its pleasure-grounds
(Pl. 12; B, 1), runs one of the main streets leading to the
W. to the <span class='sc'>Bazaars</span> (Pl. A, B, 1), or market quarter, which presents
a lively scene, especially in the early morning. The most interesting
stalls are those of the coppersmiths and of the native goldsmiths,
whose works in gold and silver filigree are sold by weight.</p>

ravines of the <i>Kuzgun Deresí</i> and the <i>Iskeleboz Deresí</i>. This is
now occupied by the Turkish town proper and contains the ruins
of the <i>Byzantine Town Walls</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>The chief artery of traffic leads through the <i>Orta Hissar</i> (Pl. A,

the wall of which projects over the W. ravine, to the <i>Fishing Harbour</i>,
the ancient harbour of Trapezūs, where remains of an almost

of the fishing-boats is very quaint.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the <i>Zendan Kapusí</i> (Pl. 14; A, 1), or W. gate, we pass
from the Seraï over a second viaduct to the <span class='sc'>West Hill</span>. Here lie (on
the left) the picturesque <i>Turkish Cemetery</i> and a suburb occupied
by Turks and Greeks. Beyond the infantry-barracks, at the W. end
of this suburb, rises the old <i>Aya Sóphia Church</i>, now a mosque.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Trebizond the <span class='sc'>Steamer</span> passes the little port of <i>Platana</i>,
the ancient <i>Hermonassa</i>, with a good roadstead, protected against
the W. and N.W. winds. The lofty <i>Cape Yoros</i> or <i>Ieros</i> (ancient

and the <i>Chal Dagh</i> (6450 ft.), the summits of which are often
covered with snow. Roads lead thence inland to the towns of
<i>Gümüshkhaneh</i> and <i>Karahissar</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on, beyond <i>Cape Zephyros</i> (Turk. <i>Zefireh Burnu</i>)
we reach the seaport of <b>Kerasun</b> or <i>Kerasund</i> (Turk. <i>Kiresün</i>,
Greek <i>Kireson</i>), founded under the name of <i>Kerasūs</i> by the Milesians
of Sinope and now a town of about 18,000 inhabitants. Like
Trebizond it was one of the resting-places of the Ten Thousand
under Xenophon (p. <a href='#Page_572'>572</a>). Its situation on and behind a small peninsula
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>(about 425 ft.; lighthouse), which used to be fortified, and
backed by superb mountains is very picturesque. The poor anchorage
of the steamers is on the W. side of the peninsula, near the
pier and the custom-house. Owing to the want of good communication
with the hinterland its maritime commerce is insignificant.</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamers seldom call at <i>Ordu</i>, the ancient <i>Kotyora</i>, but
steer across the <i>Bay of Vona</i>, the winter quarters of most of the
sailing-vessels on this coast, which is admirably sheltered by <i>Cape
Vona</i> (<i>Boōna Promontorium</i>; lighthouse).</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond <i>Yasun Burnu</i> (<i>Jasonium Promontorium</i>), the name
of which commemorates the legendary voyage of Jason and the
Argonauts (see p. <a href='#Page_560'>560</a>), the coast recedes far to the S.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without touching at the little seaport of <i>Üniyeh</i> or <i>Unia</i> (once
<i>Œnoē</i>), the steamer passes the <i>Chiva</i> or <i>Chalti Burnu</i> (<i>Heracleum
Promontorium</i>) and the large delta of the <i>Yeshil Irmak</i> (formerly
<i>Iris</i>; beacon), which is navigable for small vessels in winter only,
and steers direct towards the broad <i>Bay of Samsun</i> (landing or
embarkation 7½ pias.), which is enclosed by low hills clad with
plantations of tobacco and maize.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Samsun.</b>—<span class='sc'>Hotel.</span> <i>Mantika</i>, near the Banque Ottomane, R. 2–5,
pens. 15 fr. (bargain advisable).— <i>Restaurant Yanni</i>, near the tobacco-factory.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Banks.</span> <i>Banque Ottomane</i>, <i>Banque d’Athènes</i>, <i>Banque de Salonique</i>.—<span class='sc'>Post
Offices.</span> <i>Turkish</i>, <i>French</i>, and others, near the custom-house.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Consuls.</span> British, <i>B. Ch. Papadopulos</i>.—United States Consular Agent,
<i>William Peter</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Samsun</i>, a town with about 30,000 inhab., was in antiquity an
important Greek colony under the name of <i>Amisus</i> and is now the
chief trading-place on the N. coast of Asia Minor. The chief exports
are tobacco, flour, grain, and linseed. The manufactured goods
it imports are forwarded mainly by trains of wagons or camels to
such inland places as Mersifun, Amasia (once Amasea, the home of
Strabo), Tokat (Comana), Sivas (Sebastia), and Kaisarieh (Cæsarea).</p>

<p class='c011'>From the custom-house we turn to the left to the <i>Market Place</i>
with its clock-tower. A well-paved street leads thence to the
<i>Banque Ottomane</i>. Farther to the E., on the shore, are the <i>Seraï</i>
(see p. <a href='#Page_483'>483</a>) and several <i>Consulates</i>. The attractive <i>Villa Quarter</i>,
occupied by Armenian and Greek merchants, conveys an impression
of great prosperity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond Samsun the sandy coast juts out far towards the N.W.
We pass the strip of land separating the sea from the large lagoon
<i>Ak Göl</i>, the vicinity of which is infested by fever. <i>Cape Bafra</i>
(beacon), a little farther on, is near the delta of the <i>Kizil Irmak</i>
(<i>Halys</i>), which in B.C. 301–183 formed the boundary between the
kingdom of <i>Pontus</i> and <i>Paphlagonia</i>. Though the largest river
in Asia Minor the Kizil Irmak is not navigable.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>Beyond the month of the Halys we come to a broad semicircular
bay. On its N. shore, beyond the peninsula of <i>Boz Tepeh Burnu</i>
(about 650 ft.; beacon), is a tongue of land on which stands <b>Sinōpe</b>
(Turk. <i>Sinob</i>), the oldest of the colonies established on the coast
of the Black Sea by the Greeks of Miletus (p. <a href='#Page_491'>491</a>) and long the
most powerful. Sinope was the home of Diogenes the Cynic (about
B. C. 412–323). Here Xenophon’s Ten Thousand (p. <a href='#Page_574'>574</a>) took ship
on their way back to Byzantium (p. <a href='#Page_541'>541</a>) at the conclusion of the
toilsome Anabasis. It was also the residence of Mithridates VI.
(B. C. 120–63; comp. p. <a href='#Page_507'>507</a>), the last king of Pontus, who was famous
both for his linguistic accomplishments and his military powers.
He extended his sway over the whole of Asia Minor and the Crimea
(p. <a href='#Page_568'>568</a>), but was finally subdued by the Romans in three hardfought
campaigns. Sinope, formerly the starting-point of an important
caravan-route to Cappadocia and the lands of the Euphrates,
now possesses, notwithstanding its excellent harbour, little more
than the shadow of its former greatness. The poor little town,
inhabited by about 8000 Greeks and Turks, entirely lacks roads to
the interior. The barracks at the W. end of the headland serve as
a quarantine lazaretto.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next steam past <i>Injeh Burun</i> (<i>Syrias Promontorium</i>;
beacon), the northmost point of Asia Minor, and skirt a hilly,
well-wooded, but thinly peopled stretch of the shore.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Ineboli</b> (<i>Ionopolis</i>), the chief seaport of this part of the coast,
situated on the little river of that same name, is a poor little town
with Turkish timber-built houses (p. <a href='#Page_542'>542</a>) and a ruined castle.
The roads, with their breakwater in ruins, are exposed to every
wind and are often inaccessible in winter for days together. A
road leads hence to (ca. 50 M.) <i>Kastamuni</i>, the present capital of
the ancient Paphlagonia.</p>

<p class='c011'>The small ports beyond <i>Cape Kerembe</i> (<i>Carambis Promontorium</i>;
lights), where the coast again turns to the S.W., are not
touched at by the large steamers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on, in the ancient <i>Bithynia</i>, appear the prominent
<i>Cape Baba</i> (<i>Acherusia Promontorium</i>; beacon) and <i>Cape Kirpe</i>
or <i>Kerpe</i>, with the small island of <i>Kirpe</i> (<i>Thynias</i>; beacon). Near
Cape Baba lay the important Greek colony of <i>Heraclea Pontica</i>,
now called <i>Erekli</i> or <i>Bender Eregli</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Farther on is the <i>Yum Burnu</i> (p. <a href='#Page_560'>560</a>), which is visible at a
distance of 17 M. and marks the N. entrance to the Bosporus.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the passage of the <i>Bosporus</i> and the arrival in <i>Constantinople</i>,
see pp. <a href='#Page_560'>560</a>–558 and p. <a href='#Page_536'>536</a>.</p>
